# Model Fine-Tuning

Here, we have publicly disclosed the code used in the Model Fine-Tuning section of our research, along with publicly releasing our datasets and models.

## Training Dataset

The Minecraft QA-pairs Instruction Dataset used in our research has been publicly released on Huggingface, and you can access it at [https://huggingface.co/datasets/Aiwensile2/Minecraft_QA-pairs_Instruction_Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Aiwensile2/Minecraft_QA-pairs_Instruction_Dataset).

The code used to create this dataset is available in the "Training Dataset Generation" folder, specifically in the "training dataset generation code.ipynb" file.

## Model Fine-Tuning

The MineMA-8B series models from our Minecraft domain knowledge expert series models MineMA, which were fine-tuned in our research, have been publicly released on Huggingface. You can access our models at [https://huggingface.co/Aiwensile2/MineMA-8B](https://huggingface.co/Aiwensile2/MineMA-8B).

The code used to fine-tune these models can be found in the "LoRA Fine-Tuning Codes" folder. Specifically, the "LLaMA2 Fine-tune code.ipynb" and "LLaMA3 Fine-tune code.ipynb" files correspond to the fine-tuning of the LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 series models, respectively.

## Model Evaluation

The evaluation datasets used in our research, the Multi-Theme MCQ Dataset and the Wiki-Based MCQ Dataset, have been made publicly available on Huggingface. You can access our datasets at [https://huggingface.co/datasets/Aiwensile2/Minecraft_MCQ_Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Aiwensile2/Minecraft_MCQ_Datasets).

The code used to create these datasets can be found in the "Evaluation Dataset Generation" folder. Specifically, the generation code for the Multi-Theme MCQ Dataset is in the file named "evaluation_dataset_v1 generation code.ipynb" and the generation code for the Wiki-Based MCQ Dataset is in the file named "evaluation_dataset_v2 generation code.ipynb".

The code used for the model evaluation process can be found in the "Evaluation Code" folder, within the file named "evaluation code.ipynb".
