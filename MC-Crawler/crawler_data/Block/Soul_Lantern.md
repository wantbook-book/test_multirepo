## Obtaining
### Breaking
When broken with a pickaxe, a lantern drops itself. When broken without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. A lantern always drops if its supporting block is removed.

## Usage
Soul lanterns can be placed on the top or bottom surfaces of most solid blocks, although some require sneaking. More information can be found at Opacity/Placement.

When placed below a block the soul lantern appears to hang. They connect to chains seamlessly.

Soul lanterns can be placed (if a support platform is presented) or hanging (if a ceiling block is presented). The type of the block (solid, opaque, transparent, etc... given the block has top/bottom solid surface) does not affect the ability to hang of a soul lantern, similar to torches. Press use on the targeted block or a block adjacent to the air block the soul lantern is going to occupy to place it. If the latter is used and both the support/ceiling block is presented:

- Press use on the upper half of the adjacent block to "hang" the soul lantern up.
- Press use on the lower half of the adjacent block to "place" the soul lantern down.

If the object the soul lantern is placed on receives a block update that does not support the placement of the soul lantern, it is removed and dropped as an item (e.g: soul lantern on a trapdoor and the trapdoor is flipped).

### Light
The soul lantern emits a light level of 10. Due to their lower light level, soul lanterns do not melt snow or ice.

### Piglins
Soul lanterns repel piglins.
