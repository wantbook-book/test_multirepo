## Obtaining
### Breaking
Mangrove roots can be broken by hand, but using an axe is quickest. Mangrove roots drop themselves when broken with any tool.

↑ Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.


### Natural generation
Mangrove roots are generated in mangrove swamp biomes.

### Post-generation
When mangrove propagules grow, they develop roots that can vary in size.

## Usage
Mangrove roots can be waterlogged, despite being a full block. Water does not spread out‌[Java Edition  only] and waterlogged mangrove roots follow the same mechanics as any other waterlogged block.

Mobs do not spawn on mangrove roots.

### Redstone
Redstone circuits can pass their power level through mangrove roots and power other redstone components that are adjacent to the block, even when waterlogged.‌[Java Edition  only]

### Crafting ingredient
| Name                 | Ingredients        | Crafting recipe |
|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Muddy Mangrove Roots | Mud+Mangrove Roots |                 |

### Composting
Mangrove roots have a 30% chance of increasing the compost level in a composter by 1.

### Note blocks
Mangrove roots can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sounds.

### Fuel
When used in a furnace as fuel, mangrove roots last 15 seconds (smelting up to 1.5 items).‌[JE  only]
