# Log
A log or stem is a naturally occurring block found in trees or huge fungi, primarily used as a building block, and to create planks, a versatile crafting ingredient. It comes in ten types: oak, spruce, birch, jungle, acacia, dark oak, mangrove, cherry blossom, crimson and warped. You can sometimes also obtain oak logs in mine shafts.

## Obtaining
### Breaking
Logs and stems can be broken by hand, but using an axe speeds up the process. Logs and stems drop themselves when broken with any tool.

### Natural generation
#### Trees
Logs generate naturally as part of trees. Additionally, one jungle log generates for each jungle bush.

#### Huge fungi
Stems generate naturally as part of huge fungi.

#### Structures

- Oak logs generate as part of houses and at some meeting points in plainsvillages, and as supporting beams ofswamp hutsand normalmineshafts.


- Spruce logs generate as part of houses intaigaandsnowy plainsvillages.


- Acacia logs and stripped acacia logs generate as part of houses in savanna villages.

 Dark oak
- Dark oak logs can generate inpillager outpostsas a pile of logs, and as part of watchtowers. They also generate as supporting beams badlandsmineshafts.

Mixed
- Oak, spruce, jungle and dark oak logs generate as masts inshipwrecks.‌[Java Edition  only]

↑ a b c d The stripping must be done with an axe, which is not counted

↑ a b c Requires the burning of wood into charcoal in a furnace, which needs 8 cobblestone and burning material. The cobblestone and fuel are ignored for the purpose of this conversion.

↑ Assumed to be crafted from logs rather than wood blocks.

↑ Assumed to be crafted from logs or stems rather than wood or hyphae blocks.

↑ a b Because one plank cannot be crafted into two sticks, this crafting recipe requires two wood or hyphae for two units.


### Smelting ingredient
| Name     | Ingredients                     | Smelting recipe |
|----------|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| Charcoal | AnyLogorAnyStripped Log+Anyfuel | 0.15            |

### Fuel
Logs, but not stems, can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.

### Axes
Using an axe on a log or stem turns it into a stripped log or a stripped stem, which act the same as regular logs.

### Cocoa beans
Cocoa beans can be placed on the side of jungle logs to grow a new cocoa pod.

### Note blocks
Logs and stems can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sounds.

## Data values
Note that when a log or stem is placed, it changes its facing parameters, placing in the direction relative to the block it is placed on.

Logs and stems consider only the axis; a sideways log or stem placed while facing north does not have a top texture rotated 180 degrees from a log or stem placed south.[1]
