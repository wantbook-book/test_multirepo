## Obtaining
### Breaking
Deepslate can only be obtained by mining it using a pickaxe with the Silk Touch enchantment, otherwise it drops cobbled deepslate. If broken with any other tool, it drops nothing. The breaking time for deepslate is twice the time for stone.

↑ Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.


### Natural generation
Deepslate makes up the majority of the solid blocks generated below Y=0 in the Overworld. Stone is gradually replaced from Y=8 to Y=0 until it is completely replaced by deepslate.

Deepslate also generates in ancient cities.


### Chest loot
On ancient_city/city_center/city_center_2, they generate a furnace with 24 deepslate inside of it.

### Smelting
Deepslate can be smelted from cobbled deepslate.

| Ingredients               | Smelting recipe |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Cobbled Deepslate+Anyfuel | 0.1             |

### Post-generation
If a world generated before Caves & Cliffs: Part II is loaded after the update, the bedrock layer between Y=0 and Y=4 is replaced with deepslate.

## Usage
Deepslate can be placed in three orientations, similarly to logs. Silverfish can enter and hide in deepslate, creating an infested block.

### Note blocks
Deepslate can be placed under note blocks to produce the "bass drum" sound.
