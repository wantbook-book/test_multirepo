## Obtaining
### Breaking
When first introduced in Beta 1.4, locked chests were indestructible except to explosions, which allowed it to drop.

From Beta 1.4_01 up until its removal, locked chests were broken the same as normal chests.

### Natural generation
In Beta 1.4, if the date is April 1st of any year, the game picks a random location to generate a locked chest in every new chunk. If the chosen location is air and has a solid block below, a locked chest generates.

## Usage
The prompt that appears when the locked chest is used.
The locked chest's initial purpose was to direct players to the Minecraft Store. Clicking the use button would result in the dialog box to the left being displayed.

This functionality was exclusive to Beta 1.4; all later versions did not trigger this.


### Placement and orientation
Locked chests would decide their facing direction according to the blocks around them, generally making an attempt to face outward from walls. If their face was obstructed by a block, they would rotate accordingly to face away from said block.

Prior to Beta 1.8, said behavior was standard for directional blocks such as chests and furnaces. From Beta 1.8 onward, said blocks would instead face toward the player placing them, and would not change their facing direction depending on nearby blocks. The locked chest, being an unsupported block, was not subject to this change, and retained its old behavior up until its removal, making it unique in this aspect.

### Fuel
Locked chests could be used as fuel, lasting 1.5 items, the same as a regular chest.
