# Other Portal (block)
An Other Portal is a joke block which was added as part of the 2023 Java Edition April Fools' Day joke snapshot 23w13a_or_b. It was added as a reference to the Aether, a popular mod for Minecraft which added a fourth dimension to the game. This became a joke when players would attempt to build portals to the Aether in vanilla Minecraft and fail.[1]

## Obtaining
The shape of the Other Portal is similar to a nether portal, except that it uses glowstone instead.

It also uses a water bucket instead of a flint and steel to light the portal.

The Other Portal must be enabled by having minecraft:other_portal

## Usage
When entering the Other Portal, the player is teleported 500 blocks upwards, and the message "Error 404 Terrain Not Found!" is displayed.

If the portal is created above Y=200, it teleports players to Y=650 instead, so they aren't teleported to the Moon.
