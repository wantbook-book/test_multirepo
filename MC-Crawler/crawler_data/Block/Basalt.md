## Obtaining
### Breaking

### Natural generation
Basalt generates naturally as basalt pillars, which are found in the soul sand valley biome. They also generate in the basalt deltas biome as regular terrain and as part of basalt columns. In Java Edition, they also generate in blobs, which attempt to replace netherrack 75 times per chunk in blobs of radius 3—7, from levels 0 to 127, in basalt deltas biome.

Basalt can also be found naturally as part of bastion remnants.


### Post-generation
A simple basalt generator.
Basalt can also be made by lava flowing into a space that is on top of soul soil and adjacent to blue ice. The flowing lava is then replaced with basalt.

## Usage
Basalt's only current use is as building material. Like logs and quartz pillars, basalt points perpendicular to whatever block face they are placed on.
