# Calibrated Sculk Sensor
A calibrated sculk sensor is a craftable variant of sculk sensor. Similarly to its counterpart it detects vibrations, but with twice the range, and can detect multiple vibrations in quicker succession. It outputs a signal on all sides except for its input, which can receive power to make the sensor only listen to specific vibrations, depending on the input signal strength.

## Obtaining
### Breaking
Calibrated sculk sensors can be broken with any tool, but can be broken faster with a hoe. They drop experience when broken. When broken by an item that is enchanted with Silk Touch, a calibrated sculk sensor drops itself.

## Usage
The calibrated sculk sensor is different from the basic sculk sensor in multiple ways:

- It can detect vibrations within adistanceof 16 blocks, instead of 8.
- It has a cooldown of 1 second instead of 2.
- It can be filtered (see below) to only react to some sounds.

### Filtering
When a redstone signal powers a calibrated sculk sensor on its crystalized side, the sensor will be filtered to only respond to vibrations that match the strength of that signal. Every vibration in the game has a frequency associated with it, and every vibration frequency directly matches a specific redstone signal strength. So, for example, a vibration with a frequency of 5 matches the redstone signal with a strength of 5.

| Redstone |        | Sounds with that frequency                                                                                              |

### Block data
A calibrated sculk sensor has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.

Java Edition:

: Block entity data.
Tags common to all block entities
 last_vibration_frequency: The frequency of the last vibration.
 listener: The vibration event listener for this sculk shrieker, sculk sensor, or calibrated sculk sensor.
 event: Only exists if there is an incoming vibration.
 distance: The distance between this vibration's source and the block.
 game_event: The resource location of the vibration event that caused the current incoming vibration.
 pos: The coordinates of the source of this vibration.
: X coordinate.

: Z coordinate.
 projectile_owner: If the vibration was caused by a projectile, this is the UUID of the entity that launched the projectile. Does not exist if vibration was not caused by a projectile.
 source: The UUID of the entity that caused the vibration. Does not exist if vibration was not caused by an entity.
 event_delay: How many ticks remain until triggered by the vibration. Set to 0 if there is no incoming vibration
 selector: The data of the vibration selector.[more information needed]
