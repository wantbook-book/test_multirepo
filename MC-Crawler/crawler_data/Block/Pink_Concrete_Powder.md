## Obtaining
### Breaking
Concrete powder can be mined with any tool or by hand, but using a shovel is the quickest method.

### Crafting
The crafting recipe is shapeless; the order of ingredients does not matter.

### Renewability
Concrete powder is renewable as all of its crafting ingredients are themselves renewable. However, sand is only renewably obtained through the wandering trader, which spawns infrequently and only allows a limited number of trades per spawn, making it impractical to obtain it (and by extension, concrete powder) through only renewable means.

## Usage
Normal sand falls through the water, while one of the pink concrete powder blocks solidifies immediately on contact with the water.
Concrete powder falls when there is a non-solid block beneath it.

### Creating concrete
Main article: Concrete
If a concrete powder block comes into contact with water, it solidifies into a block of concrete. Specifically, the block has to be placed into, placed next to, or fall into flowing water, a water source block, or a waterlogged block. If placed next to a waterlogged block, it must be adjacent to the sides where water can flow out from, such as the open sides of stairs, but not the back side of stairs or any sides of waterlogged leaves. It does not solidify in midair falling past water. If it lands next to water, it solidifies only after a block update. Rain or splash water bottles also have no effect on concrete powder. Concrete powder in item form also does not become concrete. Concrete powder placed directly at water makes the placement sound of concrete.

### Note blocks
Concrete powder can be placed under note blocks to produce "snare drum" sound.

 Dynamic block entity data
Tags common to all entities
 BlockState: The falling block represented by this entity.
 Name: The resource location of the block.
 Properties: Optional. The block states of the block.
 Name: The block state name and its value.
 CancelDrop: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the block should be destroyed instead of placed after landing on a solid block. When true, the block is not dropped as an item, even if the DropItem tag is set to true. However, if the entity is deleted due to its Time value being too high, this tag is ignored and an item is dropped depending on the DropItem tag. CancelDrop defaults to 1 for falling suspicious sand and suspicious gravel, and 0 for the other vanilla falling blocks and any summoned falling block.
 DropItem: 1 or 0 (true/false) – true if the block should drop as an item when it breaks. Any block that does not have an item form with the same ID as the block does not drop even if this is set.
 FallHurtAmount: Multiplied by the FallDistance to calculate the amount of damage to inflict. By default this value is 2 for anvils, and 6 for pointed dripstone.
 FallHurtMax: The maximum hit points of damage to inflict on entities that intersect this falling block. For vanilla falling blocks, always 40 × 20.
 HurtEntities: 1 or 0 (true/false) – true if the block should hurt entities it falls on. Defaults to 1 for anvils and pointed dripstone and to 0 for the other vanilla falling blocks and any summoned falling block.
 TileEntityData: Optional. The tags of the block entity for this block.
 Time: The number of ticks the entity has existed. When Time goes above 600, or above 100 while the block is at Y=-64 or is outside building height, the entity is deleted.
