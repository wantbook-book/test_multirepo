### Placement
Buttons can be placed by using it on a surface.

They can be attached to the side, bottom and top of any full opaque block.

If placed on the top or bottom of a block, the button can face any direction.‌[Java Edition  only]

It can also be attached to the top of a fence in Bedrock Edition.

More information about placement on transparent blocks can be found at Opacity/Placement.

### Redstone power
A button can be used as a monostable redstone power source (it automatically deactivates shortly after being activated).

Buttons are usually in an inactive state, but can be temporarily activated by players. A stone button is activated by a player using it. Mobs cannot activate buttons directly.

When activated, a stone button remains active for 1 second (10 redstone ticks; 20 game ticks).

While active, a button:

- powers any adjacentredstone dusttopower level15, including beneath the button
- powers any adjacentredstone comparatorsorredstone repeatersfacing away from the button to power level 15
- strongly powers its attachment block to power level 15
- activates any adjacentmechanism components, including above or below, such aspistons,redstone lamps, etc.

When a button changes state it provides a redstone update to all redstone components adjacent to itself (including above and below), and to all redstone components adjacent to its attachment block.
