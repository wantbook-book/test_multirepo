## Obtaining
### Breaking
Mycelium can be obtained by mining it using a tool with the Silk Touch enchantment. If mined with any other tool or by hand, it drops dirt. A shovel is the fastest tool to collect it.

### Natural generation
Mycelium generates in mushroom fields biomes in abundance.


### Mob loot
Endermen can pick up mycelium blocks, and drop the block they are holding if killed.

## Usage
### Spread
A mycelium block can spread to any dirt block within one space above, one sideways, or three down. The mycelium needs light level 9+ above it, while the dirt needs light level 4+ above it, and must not be covered by any light-impeding block or any opaque block. Mycelium reverts to dirt when covered by one of the light-impeding blocks above, and the light level at that block is below 4. The death and spread behaviors are checked when a random tick lands on the block.

If there is a plant on a dirt block when mycelium spreads to it, the plant pops out and drops as an item.

### Dirt path
Mycelium can be turned into a dirt path by using any type of shovel on it.

### Effect on plants
- Mushroomsandfunguscan remain on mycelium blocks in any light level, unlike the situation on other blocks, where mushrooms are broken (dropping as items) during block updates in high light.
- Huge mushroomscan grow on mycelium, just as they can grow ondirt,grass, orpodzol.
- Mycelium cannot be tilled with ahoeto makefarmland.[1]
	- However, it can first be converted to dirt path using a shovel, then tilled with a hoe to create farmland.
