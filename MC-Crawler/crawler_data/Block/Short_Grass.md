Short grass, or grass in Bedrock Edition, is a non-solid plant block that has wheat seeds as a drop. Its color is biome-dependent, and matches the color of grass blocks.

## Obtaining
### Breaking
When broken normally, short grass has a 12.5% chance of dropping 1 unit of wheat seeds when destroyed. This is affected by the Fortune enchantment, dropping 1-3, 1-5, or 1-7 wheat seeds respectively with Fortune I, II, and III.

Short grass can be obtained as an item by destroying it with shears. Tall grass also drops two units of short grass when broken using shears.

Placing any block on short grass breaks the grass, and it does not drop seeds.

|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.05                |

### Natural generation
Short grass generates in the form of random patches, on grass blocks in most biomes with grassy soil, like plains or forests.

Short grass in a woodland mansion.
Short grass may generate on top of farmland in the "wheat farm" room of woodland mansions in place of wheat crops.

### Post-generation
Bone meal can be used on a grass block or moss block to grow short grass.

## Usage
When a sheep eats short grass, the block is destroyed, and a sheared sheep regrows its wool. Baby sheep graze grass much more often than adults and mature 1 minute faster when grazing.

### Composting
Placing short grass into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

### Bone meal
Bone meal can be used on short grass to create tall grass.
