# Sculk Catalyst
A sculk catalyst is a block that converts blocks around it to blocks in the sculk family (except for more sculk catalysts) when a mob or player that drops experience dies nearby.

## Obtaining
### Breaking
A sculk catalyst can be mined with any tool, but hoes are the quickest. It drops 5 experience if mined without Silk Touch.

### Natural generation
Sculk catalysts are generated within the deep dark biome.


### Mob loot
A warden drops a single sculk catalyst upon death, unaffected by Looting.

## Usage
Sculk catalyst blooming.
Sculk catalysts convert experience into sculk veins, sculk sensors, and sculk shriekers, and use experience to convert many natural blocks into sculk.
Sculk catalyst detection range.
It turns the blocks around the dead Mob into sculk or sculk veins.
### Blooming
When a living entity (a mob or player) dies near a sculk catalyst, it blooms. This sculk bloom converts the entity's experience into sculk charges, which can grow new sculk blocks, sensors and shriekers. Sculk blocks are always produced, with up to 1 sculk block per experience point. A sculk charge also has a 9% chance to grow a sculk sensor, and a 1% chance to grow to generate a sculk shrieker.

A bloom occurs for the death of any living entity, and can even consume multiple entities at once. Sculk blooms work on every living entity (including ender dragons [1][2], withers, and wardens). A sculk bloom cannot occur if the entity is not directly above a solid block or if the entity is below the sculk catalyst. This means pointed dripstone cannot be used to make a simple sculk farm, since sculk growth cannot happen when mobs die on pointed dripstone stalagmites.

During a sculk bloom, the catalyst gives off soul particles, and creates a patch of sculk blocks with sculk veins around them. Sculk blooms can replace blocks in the sculk_replaceable tag, including the surface materials of most of the biomes in all the Overworld, Nether, and End.

Sculk blooms occur only in response to deaths. Other sources of experience are simply ignored.

#### Blooming range
A sculk bloom occur for the death of any living entity within a Euclidean distance of 8 blocks in Java Edition or 10 blocks in Bedrock Edition from a sculk catalyst.

If the entity dies near multiple sculk catalysts, only the nearest sculk catalyst blooms.

#### Sculk charges
When a living entity (a player or mob), is consumed by a sculk bloom, it won't drop experience, because the sculk bloom event converts the entity's experience into sculk charges. 1 sculk charge is generated per experience point the mob would have dropped if it was killed by a player or a tamed wolf. These charges are used to convert the block beneath the entity into a sculk block. If the block is already a sculk block, or if there are extra sculk charges, the sculk block absorbs the sculk charges. Up to 1000 charges can be present in one block. Considering how unlikely it is for a sculk block to receive the maximum number charges, sculk blocks can store essentially unlimited charges.

The sculk charge in a block is lost when the block is destroyed or broken.

### Sculk growth

Sculk growth is an event where a sculk bloom starts on a non-sculk block. The sculk growth first tries to convert the charged block into a sculk block. The following blocks can be converted:

Stone
Granite
Andesite
Diorite
Tuff
Calcite
Deepslate
Dripstone Block
Terracotta
Netherrack
Nylium
Basalt
Smooth Basalt
Blackstone
End Stone
Gravel
Sand
Red sand
Sandstone
Red Sandstone
Dirt
Grass Block
Mycelium
Podzol
Coarse Dirt
Rooted Dirt
Clay
Moss Block
Mud
Muddy Mangrove Roots
Soul Sand
Soul Soil
in Java Edition, these blocks are marked under the sculk_replaceable tag.

Sculk growth can grow all of the sculk family blocks, except for more sculk catalysts:

If the charged block can't be converted, sculk veins grow on the block instead. If sculk veins can't grow, the sculk charge is removed and nothing happens.

Each sculk block costs 1 experience to grow, but some sculk charges are used to grow sensors or shriekers, or are lost to decay.

When a sculk block is grown, it also tries to grow sculk veins on every face of every blocks adjacent to it. This can produce upto 20 sculk veins. Each sculk vein costs 1 sculk charge when it grows on a block that cannot be converted into sculk.

Sculk growth can't happen on a block that is completely covered by blocks, unless some of those blocks are sculk veins.

Sculk veins are never placed on the sides of a sculk block and they are removed when the block they are attached to is converted to a sculk block.

#### Discharging
Every other game tick, sculk blocks and veins discharge excess sculk charges. This discharge can cause the sculk charge to spread across a patch of sculk blocks and grow the patch larger.

Every other game tick, when sculk blocks or veins discharge, they transfer all of their sculk charges to a random adjacent block. The adjacent block must be a sculk block, a sculk vein, or one of the blocks that is sculk_replaceable. If there are no adjacent blocks to discharge to, the sculk charge simply stays where it is and eventually decay.

Each time a sculk block is charged, it discharges again. This causes sculk charges to move like electricity in a daisy chain. Sculk charges from different sculk blocks and veins tend to cluster together if there are enough charges, similar to how water collects in a valley or river. Sculk charges keep moving like this until they run out due to converting blocks, constructing shriekers and sensors, or decaying.

If a sculk charge keeps discharging in the same area without creating new sculk family blocks, it decays.

Every time a sculk block or vein discharges, it a 9% chance to grow a sculk sensor, and a 1% chance to grow a sculk shrieker.

Sculk sensors and sculk shriekers cannot receive sculk charges and are only produced by them.

Sculk sensors and shriekers cannot grow if there are 2 or more sculk sensors and shriekers within a 9×3×9 box, with the bottom center of the box centered on the sculk bloom's origin (or within -4,0,-4 and 4,2,4 in relative coordinates).

Sculk shriekers generated by sculk growth won't summon wardens and shriek more frequently, because they have their can_summon tag set to false.

#### Blooming without spreading
Even though growing new sculk requires experience, sculk blooms still occur for mobs that can not drop experience on death. This is the intended behavior, and a sculk catalyst even blooms when an armor stand is destroyed[3], because the game has armor stands labeled as being living entities.

When a player with no experience dies in range of a sculk catalyst, it still blooms, and no sculk grows. If keep inventory is on, the player retains experience after dying. This prevents the sculk bloom from consuming the experience and growing sculk.[4]

### Light source
Sculk catalysts emit a light level of 6.

### Block data
A sculk catalyst has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.

Java Edition:

See also: Block entity format


 Block entity data
Tags common to all block entities
 cursors: List of sculk charge clusters associated with the sculk catalyst.
: A sculk charge cluster. Each cluster is stored within a single sculk block.
 charge: How many sculk charges are being carried in the cluster.
 pos: List of three integers representing the coordinates of the cluster.
 decay_delay: 1 or 0 (true/false) - Not to be confused with update_delay. This controls the decay of the cluster. If this is true, then the cluster was spread from a sculk block or sculk vein, and this cluster can only spread to sculk, sculk veins, and blocks with the  sculk_replaceable tag set to true. If this is false, then all the sculk charges disappear when the cluster discharges to a block that is not in the sculk family.
 update_delay: Delay in game ticks until the cluster begins to discharge (or travel) after being created. Usually starts at 1 game tick when a cluster discharges to a new block.
 facings: If the block to replace is an air or water block, the block is replaced with sculk veins, and the faces where the sculk veins are placed are also stored in their block state. The sculk veins never grow directly on the faces of a sculk block. The same thing is done to any air or water blocks that are adjacent to blocks that are adjacent to this sculk block, if sculk veins can't grow in the blocks adjacent to this sculk block without growing directly on the faces of sculk blocks.
