## Obtaining
### Breaking
Nether bricks can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, they drop nothing.

### Crafting

## Usage
Nether bricks are non-flammable and immune to ghast fireballs, making them a suitable shelter material for the Nether.

If a nether bricks block is inside the whole bounding box of a nether fortress (not just inside the individual parts), nether fortress mobs (such as blazes and wither skeletons) can spawn on it if other normal conditions are met. It is not known if this is an exclusive property of the block.
