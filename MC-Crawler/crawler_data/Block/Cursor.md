## Obtaining
Cursors are available in the creative inventory, and naturally generate in the "terminal" dimension.

### Breaking
Cursor requires a pickaxe to be mined. When mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

↑ Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.


### Natural generation
The block naturally generates in "terminal" dimension as the blinking "_" next to a "C:\" made of lime concrete. It appears to be cycling between black and lime concrete in appearance, which is what the rest of the "terminal" dimension is made of.
