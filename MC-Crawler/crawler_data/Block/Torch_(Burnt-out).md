## Obtaining
Like a normal torch, a burnt-out torch breaks instantly and drops itself when broken using anything. Tools do not lose durability when used to break burnt-out torches.

After a normal torch is placed, when it is random ticked, it becomes a burnt-out torch.

## Usage
Burnt-out torches can be re-lit with flint and steel, turning them back into regular torches.
