## Obtaining
### Breaking
A poppy can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

A poppy also breaks if water or lava runs over its location, if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

| Hardness | 0                   |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.05                |

### Natural generation
Poppies generate naturally on dirt and grass blocks in multiple biomes as part of vegetation features. In both Java Edition and Bedrock Edition, poppies can be found in the following biomes:

- Plains
- Sunflower Plains
- Meadow
- Flower Forest

In Java Edition, poppies can also generate in many additional biomes:


Savanna
Savanna Plateau
Windswept Savanna
Snowy Plains
Forest
Birch Forest
Old Growth Birch Forest
Taiga
Old Growth Spruce Taiga
Old Growth Pine Taiga
Snowy Taiga
Jungle
Bamboo Jungle
Sparse Jungle
Dark Forest
Windswept Hills
Windswept Gravelly Hills
Windswept Forest
River
Frozen River
In Java Edition, the following additional biomes are also technically allowed to generate poppies, although they very rarely or never generate grass blocks on the surface in normal worlds. As a result, poppies can generate only in edge cases or custom worlds.


Beach
Snowy Beach
Stony Shore
Ocean
Deep Ocean
Cold Ocean
Deep Cold Ocean
Frozen Ocean
Deep Frozen Ocean
Lukewarm Ocean
Deep Lukewarm Ocean
Warm Ocean
Desert
Ice Spikes
Dripstone Caves
Deep Dark
In jungles, bamboo jungles, sparse jungles, savannas and savanna plateaus, poppies are twice as common as in other biomes. In flower forests and meadows, poppies only generate as part of gradients.

Natural poppies are found in plains, savanna, and taiga villages, as well as snowy villages in Bedrock Edition. Potted poppies can also generate in woodland mansions.


### Post-generation
Main article: Flower § Post-generation
#### Java Edition
When bone meal is applied to a grass block in one of the biomes listed above, poppies have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area. In meadows and flower forests, poppies can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains, sunflower plains, dripstone caves, and the deep dark, poppies cannot generate in tulip-only areas.

#### Bedrock Edition
When bone meal is applied to a grass block in plains, sunflower plains, and flower forest, poppies have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 7×5×7 area. In flower forests, poppies can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains and sunflower plains, poppies cannot generate in tulip-only areas.

When bone meal is applied to a poppy that has been placed on top of a grass block in any biome, more poppies appear on top of nearby grass blocks. Dandelions can also occasionally appear, and poppies can occasionally appear when bone meal is applied to dandelions. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.

### Mob loot
Iron golems drop 0 to 2 poppies upon death. This is unaffected by the Looting enchantment.

Endermen can pick up poppies, like any other one-block-tall flower, and drop one if killed while holding it.

In Java Edition, baby villagers may give a poppy to players with the Hero of the Village effect.

### Trading
Wandering traders may sell a poppy for a single emerald.

## Usage
Main article: Flower § Usage
Like other flowers, poppies can be used as decoration and planted on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss blocks, mud, or muddy mangrove roots.

Poppies can also be placed in flower pots.

### Suspicious stew
Main article: Suspicious Stew
Using a poppy to make suspicious stew, whether by direct crafting or by feeding a brown mooshroom and then milking it with a bowl, imbues it with a Night Vision effect that lasts 8 seconds in Java Edition and 6 seconds in Bedrock Edition.

### Bees
Bees engage in a pollinating behavior with poppies, increasing the honey level in beehives and bee nests by 1.

### Breeding
Poppies can be used to breed, grow, and lead bees.

### Bee nests
Oak, birch, and cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of a poppy have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest and 1-3 bees in it.

### Composting
Placing a poppy into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of poppies yields an average of 5.94 bone meal.
