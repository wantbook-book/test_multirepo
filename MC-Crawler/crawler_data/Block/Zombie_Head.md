## Obtaining
### Breaking
A zombie head can be mined using any item,[1] and drops itself when broken.

| Block    | Zombie Head         |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 1                   |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 1.5                 |

If a zombie head is pushed by a piston or comes in contact with water or lava, it breaks off as an item.

When destroyed by an explosion, the zombie head always drops as an item.

### Mob loot
Zombie heads are always dropped by a zombie if it dies due to a charged creeper's explosion. In Bedrock Edition, if multiple mobs are killed by the same charged creeper, all of them drop their heads, however in Java Edition only one mob selected at random drops its head.[2]

|--------|-------------|------------------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
|        |             | Default                | Looting I | Looting II | Looting III |
| Zombie | 100%[d 1]   | 1                      | 1         | 1          | 1           |


↑ Only dropped when killed by a charged creeper.


## Usage
### Decoration
Zombie heads can be oriented in 16 different directions on top of a block, and 4 directions on the sides of blocks, similar to signs. They can be placed on top of, or beside each other by shift clicking.

### Wearing
See also:  § Renders

The player can wear zombie heads, similarly to pumpkins or helmets. This overlays the second layer of the player's skin.

#### Disguise
Wearing a zombie head reduces the detection range for zombies to 50% of the normal range. This is similar to (and stacks with) the reductions in detection range from sneaking and from the Invisibility status effect.

In Bedrock Edition, wearing a zombie head makes the player invisible to other players on a locator map.

### Dispensers
A dispenser can equip a zombie head on a player, mob, or armor stand with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing.

### Crafting ingredient
| Ingredients                   | Crafting recipe |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| Zombie head +Gunpowder+AnyDye |                 |

### Enchantments
Zombie heads can receive the following enchantments, but only through an anvil.

| Name               | Max level | Method |
|--------------------|-----------|--------|
| Curse of Binding   | I         | Anvil  |
| Curse of Vanishing | I         | Anvil  |

### Note blocks
Placing a zombie head above a note block causes the note block to play the zombie's ambient sound when activated.

The block below the note block does not affect the mob sound it creates.
