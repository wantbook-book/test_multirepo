## Equipment
A smithing table and three ingredients are required for each smithing action the player wishes to perform. Each time working on a smithing table, the player must provide a smithing template, armor/tool, and an augmenting material.

### Upgrading
While upgrading, the newly crafted netherite gear retains the enchantments, prior work penalty and number of durability points lost (instead of the remaining durability) from the diamond gear. Upgrading gear does not remove incompatible enchantments, such as multiple different Protection enchantments.

Unlike anvils, using a smithing table to upgrade diamond gear to netherite gear costs no experience and does not increase the prior work penalty.

When upgraded to netherite, all items are granted resistance to fire and lava when dropped in the world, and their durability and enchantability are increased. Swords and tools (except for hoes) deal a higher attack damage and the mining speed of tools is improved as well. Each piece of netherite armor gives 10% of knockback reduction, protecting 40% with a full set. Armor toughness is also increased.

### Trimming
A display of all 16 armor trims and 10 colors on netherite armor, as of Version 1.20
Trimming allows players to customize an armor piece's appearance by applying a material using one of the following smithing templates. During trimming, the decorative pattern applied to the armor corresponds to the trim used, with the color determined by the used material.

#### Template
- Bolt Armor Trim‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0]
- Coast Armor Trim
- Dune Armor Trim
- Eye Armor Trim
- Flow Armor Trim‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0]
- Host Armor Trim
- Raiser Armor Trim
- Rib Armor Trim
- Sentry Armor Trim
- Shaper Armor Trim
- Silence Armor Trim
- Snout Armor Trim
- Spire Armor Trim
- Tide Armor Trim
- Vex Armor Trim
- Ward Armor Trim
- Wayfinder Armor Trim
- Wild Armor Trim

#### Material
- Amethyst Shard
- Copper Ingot
- Diamond
- Emerald
- Gold Ingot
- Iron Ingot
- Lapis Lazuli
- Nether Quartz
- Netherite Ingot
- Redstone Dust

All trims are purely decorative, and don't impact gameplay in any way. Piglins do not pick up any gold-trimmed armor pieces and remain hostile towards players wearing gold-trimmed armor, unless the armor is in itself golden. Netherite-trimmed armor pieces would still not burn in fire or lava.

Most armor trims cover a small portion of the armor piece's surface with the trim material, except for the silence armor trim, which allows the trim material to cover a majority of the armor piece's surface.

Armor with a trim can be trimmed again by applying another template to it; the old trim pattern is overwritten in the process.[1] Therefore, one piece of armor cannot possess multiple trims at the same time.

If the armor material and the trimming material are the same, the color palette used for the armor trim is darker.


Including all dyed leather armor colors and regular armor, there are ≈3.679×109 different possible armor pieces, and 7.16×1035 total possible armor combinations excluding enchantments and the player not wearing armor.
