# Biome
A biome is a region in a world with distinct geographical features, plants, temperatures, humidity levels, water colors, grass colors, and foliage colors. Biomes separate every generated world into different environments, such as forests, deserts and taigas.

The biome of a location is determined during world generation rather than current environment. Even if the player completely changes all the blocks in a large area to imitate the terrain of other biomes, the actual biomes in this area will not be affected. However, in Java Edition, the /fillbiome command can change the biome in an area.

Biomes can be located using the /locate biome command.

## List of biomes
### Biome types
In Java Edition, there are 64 different biome types: 53 for the Overworld, 5 for the Nether and 5 for the End, plus one used only for a superflat preset. In Bedrock Edition there are 86 biome types: 53 for the Overworld, 5 for the Nether, 1 for the End and 27 unused.

On this page, for convenience of description and reading, the biomes in Overworld are divided into 8 categories, which are not official. While in each category, biomes may be further divided into some sub-categories. Biomes in a sub-categories are placed in one page, such as plains and sunflower plains, and are described as variants on this wiki.

### Overworld
#### Non-land biomes
These biomes are used for the generation of oceans and mushroom fields. They are large, open biomes made entirely of water going up to y=63, with underwater relief on the sea floor, such as small mountains and plains, usually including gravel, dirt, and sand. Squids and fish spawn frequently in the water, and dolphins spawn in non-frozen ocean variants.

These biomes are further divided into three categories: oceans, deep oceans and mushroom fields.

| Ocean               | The basic ocean biome. Like its colder variants, its floor is largely made up of gravel; however patches of dirt, sand and clay can also appear. Seagrass, kelp, cod and salmon‌[Bedrock Edition  only] can spawn here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Ocean               |
| Deep Ocean          | A variant of the ocean biome. In deep ocean biomes, the ocean can exceed 30 blocks in depth, making it twice as deep as the normal ocean. The ground is mainly covered with gravel. Ocean monuments generate in deep oceans, meaning guardians, elder guardians, prismarine and sponges can spawn here. Underwater ravines often generate here, with the top layer of lava being replaced by magma block that create bubble columns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Deep ocean          |
| Warm Ocean          | A variant of the ocean biome, with light teal water at the surface. Like the lukewarm ocean, it has a floor made of sand and like all oceans, it is populated with seagrass. Pufferfish and tropical fish spawn here. Unlike other ocean biomes, warm oceans allow for the generation of coral reefs and sea pickles. Kelp cannot spawn here. It is the only ocean biome that does not have a deep equivalent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Warm ocean          |
| Lukewarm Ocean      | A variant of the Ocean biome, with light blue water at the surface. Its floor is made of sand with the occasional patch of dirt or clay. Kelp and seagrass spawn here. Unlike the warm ocean biome, cod and salmon‌[BE  only] can spawn here, together with pufferfishes‌[JE  only] and tropical fishes. Coral cannot spawn here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Lukewarm ocean      |
| Deep Lukewarm Ocean | Similar to the lukewarm ocean biome, but twice as deep. Because they are a deep ocean variant, they can generate ocean monuments, resulting in the spawning of guardians, elder guardians, prismarine and sponges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Deep lukewarm ocean |
| Cold Ocean          | A variant of the ocean biome, with dark blue water at the surface. Like regular oceans and frozen oceans, its floor is made up of gravel, though occasional patches of dirt can be found. Salmon are able to spawn in cold ocean biomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Cold ocean          |
| Deep Cold Ocean     | Similar to the cold ocean biome, but twice as deep. Like other deep oceans, ocean monuments are able to generate here, which contain guardians, elder guardians, prismarine and sponges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Deep cold ocean     |
| Frozen Ocean        | A variant of the ocean biome with dark indigo water at the surface. Like the cold ocean, it has a gravel seabed and squids swimming about. However, the water's surface is frequently broken up by patches of ice and large icebergs, consisting of packed ice and blue ice, and occasionally topped with snow blocks. Strays and polar bears can spawn here, but dolphins can't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Frozen ocean        |
| Deep Frozen Ocean   | Like the frozen ocean biome, the only fishes that spawn here are salmon and cod‌[BE  only], and the floor consists of gravel. The frozen deep ocean biome also contains ocean monuments and a deeper floor than normal oceans, like other deep oceans. Frequent floating icebergs with blue ice generate here. Polar bears, rabbits and strays can also spawn here, but dolphins can't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Deep frozen ocean   |
| Mushroom Fields     | This rare biome consists of a mostly flat island and has mycelium instead of grass as its surface. However, any grass placed appears in a bright green color, even brighter than in the jungle. Mushroom fields are always adjacent to a deep ocean and are isolated from other biomes, and they are typically a few hundred blocks wide. It is one of the few biomes where huge mushrooms can generate naturally, and where mushrooms can grow in full sunlight.No mobs other than mooshrooms spawn naturally in this biome, including the usual night-time hostile mobs. This also applies to caves, mineshafts and other dark structures, meaning exploring underground is safe. However, monster spawners still spawn mobs, wandering traders along with their llamas can spawn, raids can still spawn illagers, the player can still breed animals and spawn mobs using spawn eggs and insomnia still attracts phantoms. | Mushroom fields     |

#### Highland biomes
Highland biomes are biomes with higher Y-level, rugged terrain and snow-covered peaks appear above the snow line.

These biomes are further divided into two categories: mountains and windswept hills.

| Jagged Peaks             | One of the three biomes that generate in the peaks of a mountain. This biome is found in taller and more jagged and pointy peaks that often pass the clouds and can peak at y=256. It is covered by a single layer of snow blocks with stone underneath often exposing ores such as coal, iron and emerald, and just like the snowy slopes, stone cliffs can generate in some sides of the mountain. Only goats spawn in this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Jagged peaks             |
| Frozen Peaks             | The frozen peaks are covered by snow blocks and packed ice with occasional small blobs of ice. Only goats can spawn in this biome. This biome usually generates in smoother and less jagged mountains compared to the jagged peaks biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Frozen peaks             |
| Stony Peaks              | The stony peaks are a warmer variation of peak biomes that generates in warmer regions to avoid temperature clashes. It is mainly covered by stone with large strips of calcite and exposed ores. No passive mobs spawn here and there's no snow in this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Stony peaks              |
| Meadow                   | The meadow is an elevated grassy biome found in plateaus near mountain ranges. It is filled with patches of flowers and turquoise-green short grass and tall grass. All small flowers generate except blue orchids, tulips, lilies of the valley or wither roses. Rarely, a lone oak or birch tree can generate and always has a bee nest. Both pillager outposts and plains villages can generate in this biome. Sheep, donkeys and rabbits are the only passive mobs that spawn in this biome.                                                                                                                                                                              | Meadows                  |
| Cherry Grove             | Cherry groves are grasslands with a lot of short grass, tall grass and, besides the traditional dandelions and poppies flowers, there are pink petals. The main environmental feature of the cherry grove are cherry trees identified by their striking pink color. Their leaves drop petal particles. The cherry trees may generate densely enough create a cover of leaves. The cherry grove biome is good for surviving. The sparseness of trees can help the player not to get lost while collecting a great abundance of resources.                                                                                                                                      | Cherry blossom grove     |
| Grove                    | The grove creates a forest of spruce trees beneath the mountain peaks when near a forested biome. It is quite reminiscent of the snowy taiga but the surface is covered with snow layers, snow blocks, dirt and a lot of powder snow instead of grass blocks. Rabbits, wolves and foxes can spawn in this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Grove                    |
| Snowy Slopes             | The snowy slopes generate on beneath the mountain peaks and are covered multiple layers of snow blocks and powder snow, with some sides also having stone cliffs. Goats spawn in this biome alongside rabbits. This is the only mountain biome where igloos can generate, making it one of the three biomes where igloos naturally generate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Snowy slopes             |
| Windswept Hills          | A highland biome with some steep hilltops. Cliffs, peaks, valleys, waterfalls, overhangs, floating islands, caverns and many other terrain features exist here, offering outstanding views. This is one of the few biomes where llamas can spawn naturally. Snowfall also occurs above certain heights up the mountain, thus creating snow layers on the top of the hills. Falling is a significant risk, as there are many steep ledges large enough to cause severe fall damage or even death. Windswept hills are one of a few biomes where emerald ore and infested stone can be found naturally. In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, trees cannot generate here. | Windswept hills          |
| Windswept Gravelly Hills | The windswept gravelly hills are mostly covered in gravel with occasional patches of grass and stone blocks. This makes it one of the best places to mine gravel due to the sheer quantity of it. Due to the low amount of grass, the population of spruce and oak trees in this biome is sparse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Windswept gravelly hills |
| Windswept Forest         | This biome is found when the windswept hills are located next to forested biomes. It doesn't generate stone patches so the floor is entirely covered by grass, and there are more spruce and oak trees in this biome, forming small forests with a lower tree density than the taiga biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Windswept forest         |

#### Woodland biomes
Woodland biomes are rich in plants, with trees, flowers and grasses constituting the flora on the surface. It is one of the ideal birthplaces where plenty of wood resources are available, but the dense vegetation makes it dangerous to move around the forest at night because the trees block the view, this is also true in the day time since the trees block the sunlight and mobs can spawn.

These biomes are further divided into 7 categories: forests, taiga, old growth taigas, snowy taiga, birch forests, dark forest and jungles.

| Biome name              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Screenshot              |

| Forest                  | A common biome with many oak and birch trees and a fair amount of short grass, mushrooms and flowers. This is one of the most preferred biomes to start out in, due to the abundance of wood. Like in taigas, wolves are found.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Forest                  |
| Flower Forest           | This forest variant has fewer trees, but more than makes up for it - it is almost overflowing with nearly every type of flower and tall plant in the game. Therefore, this biome is optimal for harvesting and farming dyes. Wolves do not spawn in the flower forest, although rabbits spawn occasionally. Bee nests have a higher spawn rate in this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Flower forest           |
| Taiga                   | A biome covered by a forest of spruce trees. Ferns, large ferns and sweet berry bushes grow commonly on the forest floor. One can find packs of wolves here, along with small groups of foxes or rabbits. Villages may generate in this biome; the houses in these villages are built of spruce wood. Pillager outposts may also generate in this biome. This is one of the few biomes where trail ruins can generate, along with its old growth and snowy variants.                                                                                                                                                    | Taiga                   |
| Old Growth Pine Taiga   | A biome composed of spruce trees (despite it being called a pine taiga, since there is no pine in the game), much like the standard taiga biome. However, some trees are 2×2 thick and taller than normal, akin to large jungle trees. Mossy cobblestone boulders appear frequently, mushrooms are common, and podzol can be found on the forest floor. There are also patches of coarse dirt that do not grow grass, with some dead bushes. Wolves and foxes may also spawn here, as they do in normal taiga biomes. Rabbits may also spawn here‌[JE  only].                                                           | Old growth pine taiga   |
| Old Growth Spruce Taiga | At first glance, this biome may look almost exactly the same as its pine tree counterpart. However, the most striking feature of this biome is its giant spruce trees, which are essentially a scaled-up version of regular spruce trees. One can easily differentiate this from an old growth pine taiga by observing how the leaves almost completely cover the tree trunks, whereas in pine ones, leaves tend to cover only the top.                                                                                                                                                                                 | Old growth spruce taiga |
| Snowy Taiga             | Much like the regular taiga, the snowy taiga has large expanses of spruce trees. Ferns and their taller variants generate here commonly, although short grass can still be found. It is one of the few places where wolves and foxes spawn naturally. One may also find an igloo nestled between the trees from a more or less flat terrain, making it one of the three biomes where igloos naturally generate. Villages‌[BE  only] and pillager outposts‌[BE  only] may also generate here. Villages use the same architecture as taiga villages but the villagers wear snowy biome outfits.                           | Snowy taiga             |
| Birch Forest            | A forest where the grass is aqua and only birch trees generate. Unlike in the regular forest, no wolves spawn in this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Birch forest            |
| Old Growth Birch Forest | Birch trees grow much taller than usual in this uncommon variant of the birch forest biome. Whereas normal birch trees grow up to 7 blocks tall, these trees usually are 11 blocks in height. This makes deforestation a much more difficult task, although it provides the player with far more resources. Trail ruins also generate here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Old growth birch forest |
| Dark Forest             | This biome is mainly composed of dark oak trees, a mostly closed roof of leaves, and occasional huge mushrooms. Trees in this forest are so densely packed together that it's dark enough for hostile mobs to spawn, even during the day. On rare occasions, a woodland mansion may spawn, making the dark forest the only biome in which that structure can be found.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Dark forest             |
| Jungle                  | A dense forested biome. It features ferns and large jungle trees that can reach up to 31 blocks tall with 2×2 thick trunks. Oak trees are also common though. The landscape is lush green, leaves cover much of the forest floor—these "bush trees" have single-blocks of jungle wood for trunks, surrounded by oak or jungle leaves. Vines are found alongside most blocks and may cover the surface of caves. Ocelots, jungle pyramids, trail ruins, melons, cocoa beans, pandas and parrots spawn in this biome. Melons generate in patches, similar to pumpkins, but are common.                                    | Jungle                  |
| Sparse Jungle           | In stark contrast to the wild and overgrown vegetation of the jungle biomes, the sparse jungle consists of a few small and isolated jungle trees, with patches of melons here and there. The terrain in which this biome can generate is often flat, with some small rises in elevation. All mobs that spawn in the jungle, including parrots, ocelots, pandas‌[Bedrock Edition  only] also spawn in the sparse jungle. ‌In Java Edition 1.20.5 and Bedrock Edition 1.20.80‌[upcoming], wolves can also spawn in this biome.                                                                                            | Sparse jungle           |
| Bamboo Jungle           | The terrain in this biome is covered by grass with some patches of podzol. Unlike the normal jungle, bushes still generate but do not cover the floor. Additionally, large jungle trees that are 2×2 instead of the normal 1×1 can generate here, along with large or balloon oak trees. The density of trees in this biome is much less compared to sparse jungle, but massive amounts of bamboo shoots generate covering this biome. Jungle exclusive mobs such as ocelots and parrots can spawn in here, pandas have an even higher spawn rate than in regular jungle. Jungle pyramids can also generate‌[JE  only]. | Bamboo jungle           |

#### Wetland biomes
Wetland biomes contains rivers, swamps and beaches. They have a large amount of water resources. Rivers separate other biomes; beaches generate as a transition between the ocean and land.

| River          | A biome that consists of water blocks that form an elongated, curving shape similar to a real river. Unlike real rivers, however, they have no current. Rivers cut through terrain or separate the main biomes. They attempt to join up with ocean biomes, but sometimes loop around to the same area of ocean. Rarely, they can have no connection to an ocean, instead of forming a loop. The grass has a dull aqua tone, much like the ocean, and trace amounts of oak trees tend to generate there as well. Rivers are also a reliable source of clay. These biomes are good for fishing, but drowned can spawn at night. In Bedrock Edition, mobs other than salmon, squid and drowned cannot spawn in this biome, even underground, except in a monster spawner.                                                                                                                                        | River                         |
| Frozen River   | A river with a layer of ice covering its surface. It generates when a river goes through snowy biomes. Salmon spawn underwater while rabbits and polar bears spawn on ice. At night, drowned can spawn below the ice with strays on the surface. In Bedrock Edition, no other hostile mobs can spawn here, even underground, except from a monster spawner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Frozen river                  |
| Swamp          | A biome characterized by a mix of flat areas around sea level and shallow pools of green water with floating lily pads. Clay, sand and dirt are commonly found at the bottom of these pools. Trees are covered with vines and can be found growing out from the water. Mushrooms and sugar canes are abundant, and blue orchids grow exclusively here. Frogs of the temperate variant can spawn here as well. Swamp huts with a black cat and a witch generate exclusively in swamps. Slimes also spawn naturally at night, most commonly on full moons. Some zombies may end up underwater, which can transform them into drowned, making this an especially dangerous biome at night. Temperature varies within the biome, causing foliage and grass colors to vary. In Bedrock Edition, huge mushrooms also spawn in this biome. Visibility is also lower than other biomes when the player is underwater. | SwampSwamp in Bedrock Edition |
| Mangrove Swamp | A biome characterized by a dense foliage, featuring plenty of mangrove trees which vary a lot in height. The floor is mainly composed of mud blocks with occasional grass patches. The grass has the same color as in the normal swamp but leaves and vines have a unique light green tint and the water is teal rather than gray. Frogs often spawn in this biome and all frogs spawned here are warm frogs. Slimes also spawn naturally at night, most commonly on full moons. Some zombies may end up underwater, which can transform them into drowned, making this an especially dangerous biome at night. Visibility is also lower than other biomes when the player is underwater.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Mangrove swamp                |
| Beach          | Generated where oceans meet other biomes, beaches are primarily composed of sand. Beaches penetrate the landscape, removing the original blocks and placing in sand blocks. These are also useful for fishing. Buried treasure can be found under few blocks of sand. Passive mobs other than turtles do not spawn on beaches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Beach                         |
| Snowy Beach    | Like a regular beach, one can find plenty of sand in this biome and buried treasure can be found underground in this snowy beach. However, sand is covered in a layer of snow. Snowy beaches are found when a snowy biome borders a frozen ocean biome. No passive mobs other than rabbits‌[BE  only] spawn in this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Snowy beach                   |
| Stony Shore    | True to its name, this stone-covered biome often appears where mountains meet the ocean. Depending on the height of the nearby land, stony shores may generate as medium slopes or huge cliffs, its tops tall enough to be covered by snow even when near warmer biomes.[1] No passive mobs spawn here. Buried treasure can generate here‌[BE  only]. Strips of gravel can sometimes be found here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Stony shore                   |

#### Flatland biomes
These biomes have a flat terrain and a wide view. Trees spawn less here and water sources are plentiful. They also have a higher number of passive mob spawns.

These biomes are further divided into two categories: plains and snowy plains.

| Biome name       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Screenshot       |

| Plains           | A flat and grassy biome with rolling hills and few oak trees. Villages are common. Cave openings, lava lakes and waterfalls are easily identifiable due to the flat unobstructed terrain. Farm mobs are easily found in plains biomes; this biome and its variants are also of the few biomes where horses spawn naturally. Pillager outposts may also be generated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Plains           |
| Sunflower Plains | A fairly uncommon variation of the plains, this biome is the only place where sunflowers naturally generate, hence the name. They grow in abundance, making yellow dye a widely available resource. In Bedrock Edition, villages may also generate here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Sunflower plains |
| Snowy Plains     | An expansive biome with a huge amount of snow layers. Sugar cane can generate in this biome, but can become uprooted when chunks load as the water sources freeze to ice. There are few spruce trees in this biome. No animal mobs other than rabbits and polar bears are able to spawn, however, it is one of the few biomes where strays appear. In Bedrock Edition, this biome doesn't spawn monsters other than strays and skeletons, but monster spawners can still spawn monsters. Due to the biome's size and scarcity of wood and animals, initial survival becomes difficult in comparison to other biomes. This is one of the three biomes where igloos naturally generate. Villages and pillager outposts may also generate here. | Snowy plains     |
| Ice Spikes       | A rare variation of the snowy plains biome that features large spikes and glaciers of packed ice. Usually, the spikes are 10 to 20 blocks tall, but some long, thin spikes can reach over 50 blocks in height. The floor in this biome is entirely covered in snow blocks instead of grass, and ice patches made of packed ice can generate on it. Like the regular snowy plains, no animal mobs other than rabbits and polar bears are able to spawn and strays appear at night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Ice spikes       |

#### Arid-land biomes
In these biomes, it neither rains or snows at all, but the sky still turns overcast during inclement weather. The surface is covered with sparse vegetation.

These biomes are further divided into three categories: deserts, savannas and badlands.

| Biome name        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Screenshot        |

| Desert            | A barren and inhospitable biome consisting mostly of sand dunes, dead bushes and cacti. Sandstone and sometimes fossils are found underneath the sand. The only passive mobs that spawn naturally in deserts are gold/creamy rabbits, their coloring well-camouflaged against the sand. At night, husks usually spawn in the place of normal zombies; the lack of visual obstruction makes hostile mobs highly visible. Sugar cane can be found if the desert is next to a river biome. Desert villages, desert wells and desert pyramids are found exclusively in this biome. Pillager outposts can also generate here.                                                                                                                                                                                        | Desert            |
| Savanna           | A relatively flat and dry biome with a dull-brown grass color and acacia trees scattered around the biome, though oak trees may generate now and then. Tall grass covers the landscape. Villages can generate in this biome, constructed of acacia wood, with some stained terracotta. Pillager outposts can also generate here. Horses, llamas‌[BE  only], and armadillos‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80] can naturally spawn here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Savanna           |
| Savanna Plateau   | This biome generates when a normal savanna biome spawns at high altitudes and near mountains. It is mostly indistinguishable from the standard savanna with the main differences being the fact that llamas, armadillos‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80] and wolves‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80] can spawn and villages and pillager outposts can't generate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Savanna plateau   |
| Windswept Savanna | Unlike the mostly flat and calm terrain of the savanna biome, this uncommon variant generates in chaotic terrain covered in gigantic mountains covered in coarse dirt and some patch of stone. The mountains in the windswept savanna biome are extremely steep, jutting out at 90-degree angles, making it almost impossible to climb. Ocean-like lakes also generate here. On top of that, they can reach heights comparable to the mountain peak biomes - they can rise above the clouds. Massive waterfalls and lavafalls are quite common here. The unforgiving terrain means villages and outposts do not generate in this biome. Armadillos‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80] can naturally spawn here, as well as llamas in Bedrock Edition.                                                           | Windswept savanna |
| Badlands          | An uncommon biome where large mounds of terracotta and stained terracotta generate. Red sand also generates here instead of regular sand, with occasional cacti and dead bushes. This biome is usually found alongside desert biomes and it can generate in mountainous terrain. No passive mobs spawn in this biome, even if all other spawning conditions are met. Mineshafts generate at a higher altitude than normal - occasionally a player may come across a mineshaft jutting out of the badlands. Gold ore also occurs more frequently, because additional blobs can generate within badlands up to Y=256. The composition of this biome is useful when other sources of terracotta and gold are scarce. The only passive mob that can spawn here is the armadillo‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80]. | Badlands          |
| Wooded Badlands   | The wooded badlands has layers of coarse dirt and forests of oak trees that generate atop the badlands in humid areas. The color of the grass and leaves is a dull green-brown hue, giving it a dried and dead appearance. These trees are a rare source of wood when living in the otherwise barren and lifeless badlands. ‌In Java Edition 1.20.5 and Bedrock Edition 1.20.80‌[upcoming], wolves and armadillos are the only mobs that can spawn here during the day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Wooded badlands   |
| Eroded Badlands   | This rare variant generates unique terrain features that are similar to the structures in Utah's Bryce Canyon. Tall and narrow spires of colorful terracotta rise out of the floor of the canyon, which like all other badlands variants, is covered in red sand. The only mob that can spawn here is the armadillo‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Eroded badlands   |

#### Cave biomes
These biomes generates inside caves in the Overworld. They're mostly found underground but can sometimes leak out of cave entrances.

| Biome name      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Screenshot      |

| Deep Dark       | A dimly lit cave biome that generates deep underground mostly within the deepslate layer. It is largely sculk blocks 1 block thick upon all surfaces, with frequent sculk sensors and occasional sculk shriekers of which the latter can directly summon the warden (or multiple wardens). An ancient city is a large structure which can generate here, including a warden-like city center generated structure (and valuable chests with unique loot, including a high chance of finding enchanted golden apples, which are widely considered to be one of the rarest items in the game). As with mushroom fields, no other hostile mobs spawn here. While breaking sculk blocks, which can even be generated via mobs dying near a sculk catalyst, can be a good source of experience, the very high chance of instant death from a nearly unkillable warden (with a ranged attack) means that this is probably the most dangerous place in the Overworld to attempt this way of leveling-up. | Deep dark       |
| Dripstone Caves | These are caves filled with dripstone blocks and pointed dripstone both hanging as stalactites and growing from the ground as stalagmites and small water wells of 1×1 in the ground. Large dripstone clusters structures generate occasionally inside these caves. Copper ore blobs found in this biome are much bigger compared to other biomes. Drowned are able to spawn in aquifers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Dripstone caves |
| Lush Caves      | Lush caves are often found underground below azalea trees. As the name suggests, these caves are lush and covered by moss blocks, moss carpets, short grass and azalea bushes on the floors. On the ceiling, vines and cave vines with glow berries grow down and light up the caves, and spore blossoms grow from the ceiling and spore particles. There are also shallow lakes with clay where dripleaf plants grow out of them and axolotls spawn, making this the only biome where they can spawn. Tropical fish can also spawn inside the aquifers in a lush cave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Lush caves      |

#### Void biomes
These are spawned in an open area in the void.

| Biome name                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Screenshot |

| The Void‌[Java Edition  only] | Can be accessed only through Single Biome world selection or The Void superflat preset. In a single biome world, the landscape consists of stone, as well as water and bedrock depending on the generator type. In The Void superflat preset, the world is completely empty except for a single structure: a 33×33 stone platform with a single block of cobblestone in the center. No mobs (passive or hostile) can spawn without spawn eggs, monster spawners or commands. It also doesn't rain in this biome. | The Void   |

### The Nether
The Nether is considered a different dimension. It is a hellish place; all biomes in this dimension are dry and it is not possible to place water in these biomes; ice can still be placed, though it does not turn into water upon melting.

| Nether Wastes    | The nether wastes is a massive cave that carves through the majority of the dimension. The main terrain consists of netherrack, with glowstone clusters growing and lava leaking from the ceiling and gravel and soul sand lining its shores. It is the most barren Nether biome, but also the easiest to traverse as there is largely no terrain that could possibly block a player's path. The only real threats would be the monsters: the fire-breathing ghasts, the piglins and their undead versions, the powerful magma cubes and the rare enderman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Nether wastes    |
| Soul Sand Valley | The soul sand valley is a large grotto that is extensive and cuts through the Nether's usual terrain. Notable features of the biome are exposed nether fossils in various shapes and sizes, large amounts of lava, blue fog, large spires made of basalt, soul fire and the occasional nether fortress or bastion remnant. The biome itself consists of soul sand, basalt and soul soil. This biome is extremely dangerous to traverse due to the combination of ghasts and skeletons spawning here and soul sand slowing down the player's movement speed, making it easy for a player to get overwhelmed by projectile attacks. In addition, igniting soul sand or soul soil (especially since ghast fireballs start fires near impact point) can create soul fire, which does more damage/second than regular fire if players get caught in it. It is recommended to avoid this biome unless players have sufficient equipment/strategies to navigate the terrain. The Soul Speed enchantment is especially helpful for traveling through this biome.                                                           | Soul sand valley |
| Crimson Forest   | The crimson forest is a “red” crimson-themed biome, with warped and crimson fungus as well as huge crimson fungus scattered around the environment.There are huge fungus structures that contain weeping vines hanging off them and may also have a few blocks of shroomlight. The floor of the biome is covered in crimson nylium, with crimson roots growing. Occasional patches of netherrack and red nether wart blocks are found scattered throughout the biome. In the ceiling, apart from glowstone clusters, there are sparse nether wart block stalactites with vines growing.Piglins, zombified piglins and hoglins naturally spawn in this biome. As long as players equip at least one piece of gold armor, piglins should not cause any trouble. Hoglins can also be repelled by staying close to warped fungus. However, without these countermeasures, this biome can be fairly hostile to navigate. Nevertheless, the abundance of hoglins in this biome makes it a great source of food in the Nether, and the high population of piglins makes this biome an ideal location to barter with them. | Crimson forest   |
| Warped Forest    | The huge fungus structures may have a few blocks of shroomlight scattered around them. The floor of the biome is covered in warped nylium, with warped roots and nether sprouts growing. Occasional patches of raw netherrack and warped wart blocks can be found scattered throughout the biome.Apart from striders, endermen are the only mobs that spawn in this biome, making the warped forest an ideal location to collect ender pearls to access the End. This biome is also a relatively safe place to reside in the Nether, due to the fact that no hostile mobs spawn here. However, do note that other hostile mobs can still spawn from bastion remnants that generate here, as well as from nether fortresses that have cut into a warped forest after generating in another biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Warped forest    |
| Basalt Deltas    | A gray biome, the basalt deltas are said to be the remnant of ancient volcanic eruptions. The ground consists of basalt and blackstone blocks, with small patches of netherrack and pools of lava. The shape of the terrain is chaotic and uneven, making it somewhat difficult to traverse and build on. Unlike the other biomes in the Nether, bastion remnants do not generate in basalt deltas. When this biome borders a lava ocean, clusters of basalt form near the coast.Magma cubes have a high spawn rate in this biome, making the basalt deltas the best place to farm magma cream. This biome also contains a much higher abundance of blackstone compared to other Nether biomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Basalt deltas    |

| The End           | This biome is used to generate the circle of radius 1000 centered at the 0,0 coordinates in the End. The End central island is generated at the center of this circle, and it's surrounded by a complete vacuum all the way to the edge of the biome. Most of the End features are exclusive to that island, including the ender dragon, the obsidian pillars, the end crystals, the 5×5 spawn platform, the exit portal and the 20 central end gateways. Large amounts of endermen spawn in this biome. It does not rain or snow in this biome unlike the other low-temperature biomes. The outer islands in the End can be accessed using end gateways after the ender dragon has been defeated.If the biome is used for a superflat world, the sky appears nearly black and an ender dragon spawns at the 0,0 coordinates in the Overworld. Only endermen spawn at night. | The End           |
| Small End Islands | Generates as part of the outer islands of the End. This biome represents the empty expanse between the larger islands, populated by the smaller, circular islands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Small end islands |
| End Midlands      | Generates as part of the outer islands of the End. This biome represents the gradual slope from the hilltops of each island down to the cliffs around the edge. End cities generate here, but chorus trees do not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | End midlands      |
| End Highlands     | Generates as part of the outer islands of the End. This biome represents the hilltops of each island, and is the only biome in the End where both chorus trees and end cities generate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | End highlands     |
| End Barrens       | Generates as part of the outer islands of the End. This biome represents the outer rims of each island, with steep cliffs below the edge.

| Legacy Frozen Ocean              | Polar bears, salmon, cod, strays, cold underwater ruins, gravel, seagrass, kelp, snowy rabbits, ice, shipwrecks                       | Similar to thefrozen oceanbiome, but without icebergs, it is completely flat. Because they are a frozen ocean variant, they can spawn polar bears and strays, but not dolphins. Unlike the regular frozen ocean, polar bears, drowned, squid, salmon, cod, rabbits, skeletons and strays are the only mobs that spawn here. Kelp also generates here. This biome doesn't generate naturally fromPocket Edition Alpha 0.9.0onward. WhenBedrock Edition 1.4.0introduced the new frozen ocean, this biome was not removed or replaced by the new frozen ocean, although the id name changed from`frozen_ocean`to`legacy_frozen_ocean`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Legacy frozen ocean                                           |
| Desert Lakes                     | Sand, cacti, water, sugar canes, gold rabbits, desert well, fossils, husks                                                            | In this biome, patches of water are more common, and the terrain is slightly more rough. Although desert wells can be found, desert pyramids, villages and outposts do not generate in this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Desert lakes                                                  |
| Mountain Edge                    | Grass blocks, dirt, stone, llamas, emerald ore, infested stone, spruce trees, oak trees, snow                                         | Similar to thesparse junglebiome, the mountain edge used to generate exclusively at the edge of windswept hills biomes in order to smooth the transition between biomes. This biome has lots of trees, similar to windswept forests. While the terrain is lower and gentler in nature, some areas may reach high enough to be covered by snow. This biome doesn't generate naturally fromPocket Edition v0.9.0 alphaandJava Edition 1.7.2onward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Mountain edge                                                 |
| Deep Warm Ocean                  | Dolphins, pufferfish, tropical fishes, warm underwater ruins, sand, seagrass, ocean monuments, guardians, elder guardians, shipwrecks | Similar to thewarm oceanbiome, but without coral reefs or sea pickles, and twice as deep. Because they are a deep ocean variant, they can generate ocean monuments, resulting in the spawning of guardians, elder guardians,prismarineandsponges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Deep warm ocean                                               |

Snowy mountains have a lower chance of spawning passive mobs during world generation than other biomes (7% versus 10%).Giant spruce taiga hills are a special case. In Java Edition, the game code sets the values setBaseHeight and setHeightVariation to define a "hilly" biome, but uses the same values as for its non-hill variant (giant spruce taiga), meaning there is absolutely no terrain difference between the two biomes. In Bedrock Edition, this biome generates as a hillier version of the giant spruce taiga, but uses the same trees as the giant tree taiga hills (with leaves only at the top), resulting in the differences between these biomes being non-terrain aspects like water color and temperature. | Giant tree taiga hillsDesert hillsJungle hillsSnowy mountains |

However, neither of these biomes closely resemble their counterparts.Compared to the average badlands plateau, the modified badlands plateau features more variable terrain and smaller plateaus, as if a larger plateau was weathered down over time. It is the second-rarest biome in the game, after the modified jungle edge.The terrain of the shattered savanna plateau biome is much less tame than its normal counterpart. It features incredibly large and steep mountains that jut out of the terrain, similar to the shattered savanna biome, albeit slightly smaller and gentler in comparison.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Modified badlands plateauShattered savanna plateau            |

However, the plateaus that generate here are generally smaller, allowing far less foliage to generate. The terrain is more erratic, and can be compared to that of the similar modified badlands plateau biome, having an old and eroded appearance. Eroded badlands generate instead of desert alongside this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Modified wooded badlands plateau                              |

However, it does not generate if the ocean biome is a deep ocean. This biome also generates when a river meets a mushroom fields biome, similar to what frozen rivers do in snowy plains. The terrain of this biome is much more flat and shallow than the main mushroom fields biome, though it contains many of the same features, such as a mycelium surface layer, huge mushrooms and lack of hostile mobs, but shipwrecks and buried treasure can generate here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Mushroom Field Shore                                          |

| Tundra          | Snow, grass blocks, ice                                 | Snowy, barren terrain with few trees. The occasional trees do exist, although rarely. Ice can be found over water. Snow is common weather in tundras. It generates when the temperature is below 50% and the downfall is less than 20%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Tundra          |
| Rainforest      | Grass block, short grass, ferns, oak trees, birch trees | Rainforests are wet biomes with many trees, which have a 1 in 3 chance of being big, instead of 1 in 10 like all other biomes. They generate only oak trees and have a large amount of short grass and ferns. A biome is classified as a rainforest if the temperature is greater than 97% and the downfall is more than 90%. This could be the biome with some of the most cliffs and hills, because the world generator reduces height variation at lower downfalls. | Rainforest      |
| Seasonal Forest | Grass block, short grass, oak trees                     | Seasonal forests spawn with a temperature of 97% or greater, and a downfall value between 45% and 90%. They are commonly found between forest and rainforests, and near plains biomes. They are identical to forests, except they have fewer trees and can spawn only oak trees. They have a little bit of short grass.                                                                                                                                                | Seasonal forest |
| Ice Desert      | Sand, snow, ice                                         | An unused biome before Beta 1.8 that was in the code but never implemented into the temperature/downfall table and thus did not actually generate. It was a biome of sand with snow on top of it and had snowfall and ice (the player can create something similar using the buffet world option and choosing the snowy beach biome).                                                                                                                                  | Ice desert      |
| Shrubland       | Grass block, oak trees, birch trees                     | A biome with few trees and no short grass. It is identical to the savanna biome. It is one of the smallest biomes in the game. It can generate if the temperature is between 50% and 97%, and the downfall value is below 35%. It is too small to generate a forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Shrubland       |

## Tint
### Plants
Biome grass and foliage colors are selected from two 256×256 colormap images: grass.png and foliage.png under assets/minecraft/textures/colormap‌[JE  only] or textures/colormap‌[BE  only]. The grass.png colormap sets the colors for grass block, short grass, tall grass, ferns, large ferns, ferns in flower pots, sugar canes and stems of pink petals. Meanwhile, the foliage.png colormap sets the colors for vines and tree leaves of oak, jungle, acacia, dark oak and mangrove. Only the colors in the lower-left halfs of both images are used, even though the upper-right side of foliage.png is colored.

- grass.png
- foliage.png

The adjusted temperature and adjusted downfall values (recognized as AdjTemp and AdjDownfall in the following, respectively) are used when determining the biome color to select from the colormap. They are computed as follows:

AdjTemp = clamp( Temperature, 0.0, 1.0 )

AdjDownfall = clamp( Downfall, 0.0, 1.0 ) * AdjTemp.

"clamp" limits the range of the temperature and downfall to 0.0—1.0. The clamped downfall value is then multiplied by the adjusted temperature value, bringing its value to be inside the lower left triangle. Treating the bottom-right corner of the colormap as AdjTemp = 0.0 and AdjDownfall = 0.0, the adjusted temperature increases to 1.0 along the X-axis, and the adjusted downfall increases to 1.0 along the Y-axis.

#### Special plant tints
In the following cases, the plants are not tinted exactly according to the colormap. In Java Edition, several of them are specified in biome Jsons in vanilla data pack. 

Swamps
In swamps and mangrove swamps, the color for grass blocks, short and tall grass, small and large ferns, ferns in flower pots, sugar canes and the stems of pink petals is based on a noise on XZ plane. When the value of this noise is less than -0.1, it uses the color  #4c763c. Otherwise using  #6a7039. The color for vines and leaves of oaks, jungles, acacias, dark oaks and mangroves is  #6a7039 in swamps and  #8db127 in mangrove swamps, which are not affected by the colormap.

Dark Forest
In dark forest, the color for grass blocks, short and tall grass, small and large ferns, ferns in flower pots, sugar canes and the stems of pink petals is the result of the bitwise AND between the color in the colormap and  #fefefe, and then averaging with  #28340a. In vanilla, that is  #507a32.

Badlands
In badlands, wooded badlands and eroded badlands, the color for grass blocks, short and tall grass, small and large ferns, ferns in flower pots, sugar canes and the stems of pink petals is  #90814d. The color for vines and leaves of oaks, jungles, acacias, dark oaks and mangroves is  #9e814d. Both are not affected by the colormap.

Cherry grove
The color for plants in the cherry grove is always  #b6db61, which is not affected by the colormap.

Other leaves
The color for spruce leaves is  #619961 and the color for birch leaves is  #80a755. Both are not affected by the biome.

### Environment
The color of the sky in Overworld changes according to the basic temperature value of the biome. The basic temperature is first modified as T = clamp( Temperature / 3 , -1.0, 1.0 ). Then the triple (0.62222224−0.05T,0.5+0.1T,1) is the sky color. In addition, the colors of water, underwater fog and fog in a biome are defined in the vanilla data pack‌[JE  only] or vanilla resource packs‌[BE  only].

See the List of biome climates for these colors.

### Transition
When plants or water are at the borders between or among biomes, the color is affected by the biome of the surrounding blocks at the same Y-level. The range of the block involved in the calculation is determined by the biome blend radius in options. Takes the plant color or water color of the biomes within a square centered on this block and with the side length being the biome blend radius, and calculates their average value to get the final color for this block.

The sky color ‌[JE  only] and the fog color use the color processed by Gaussian blur from colors of the biomes at each block in the range of 5×5×5 centered on the block the camera is in.

## Climate
A biome has three climate attributes: temperature, downfall and precipitation.

### Temperature
Each biome has a base temperature value (see the List of biome climates), but the actual temperature value at each location in the biome is also affected by the height of the location. Locations with Y≤80 use the base temperature as actual temperature. At Y=81, the actual temperature value randomly fluctuates up and down by -0.00875 — +0.01125 from the base temperature based on a noise on the XZ plane, and at Y≥81 the actual temperature decreases by 0.00125 (1⁄800) every block up.

In Java Edition, specially in Frozen Ocean and Deep Frozen Ocean, it is also affected by another noise on XZ plane. In some regions according to the noise, the base temperature value is always regarded as 0.2. The actual temperature values for these regions are also calculated on this basis. This is detectable in Frozen Ocean, as its base temperature is low enough to freeze or snow, so that only these regions do not freeze or snow at sea level.

### Downfall
The downfall value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (see the List of biome climates). When the downfall value is greater than 0.85, the biome is marked as humid, which is related only to the random extinction of fire. This value doesn't affect the weather. See Rain.

### Precipitation
The precipitation value can be "true" or "false". If the precipitation of the biome is false, no rain or snow occur. Otherwise, a location is rainable when its temperature value is greater than 0.15, and snowable otherwise.

So, if the base temperature is not greater than 0.15, it's snowable at any Y level. And if greater than 0.15, it can snow above a certain Y level, which are listed below:

### Snow accumulation
In Java Edition, the maximum snow accumulation layer can be set by snowAccumulationHeight game rules. In Bedrock Edition, the maximum snow layer is based on the snow accumulation value of the biome. The value is an array of 2 numbers, representing the minimum and maximum snow heights, with 0.0 being no snow and 1.0 being the full height of one block.
