## Usage
### Crafting ingredient
| Name            | Ingredients                                        | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Beetroot Soup   | Beetroot+Bowl                                      |                 |
| Mushroom Stew   | Red Mushroom+Brown Mushroom+Bowl                   |                 |
| Rabbit Stew     | Cooked Rabbit+Carrot+Baked Potato+AnyMushroom+Bowl |                 |
| Suspicious Stew | Red Mushroom+Brown Mushroom+Bowl+AnySmall Flower   |                 |

### Mooshrooms
Using a bowl on a mooshroom turns the bowl into mushroom stew or suspicious stew. The stew can then be consumed immediately and the process repeated, making this an excellent way to quickly restore depleted hunger and saturation with almost no cost or effort.

### Fuel
Bowls can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 0.5 items per bowl in Java Edition, and 1 item per bowl in Bedrock Edition.
