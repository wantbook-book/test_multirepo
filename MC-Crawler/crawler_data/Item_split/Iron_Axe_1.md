### Weapon
When used as a weapon, an iron axe loses 2 durability points.

#### Java Edition
Attacking a shield user with an axe disables the use of the shield for 5 seconds. Vindicators, piglin brutes, or other mobs with commands always disable the player's shield. Damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a sword of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to recover, resulting in lower DPS.

| Attack Damage | Attack Speed | Recovery time                 | DPS | Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1] |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------------------|-----|-----------------------------------|
| 9             | 0.9          | 1.11 seconds (22.2game ticks) | 8.1 | 1125× 562.5                       |


↑ The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because axes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.


#### Bedrock Edition
Iron axes attack instantly with no cooldown and deal 5 damage, but they lower the durability of armor and shields faster than a sword would do.
