# Elytra
Elytra are rare wings found only in end ships in the outer islands of the End. While worn as torso armor, they allow gliding by pressing jump while midair. Firework rockets can be used as propulsion while gliding, allowing for true flight.

## Obtaining
### Natural generation
Elytra are found only in end cities in item frames in the treasure room of the end ship. A shulker guards the elytra and the ship's two loot chests.

#### Unit repair

Repair & NameDamaged Elytra
A pair of elytra can be repaired in an anvil by adding phantom membranes, with each membrane restoring 25% of the elytra's maximum durability, rounded down. Two pairs of elytra can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the elytra's enchantments.

## Usage
 

Elytra are equipped in the chestplate slot, either by placing the item directly in the slot, by pressing use item while held in hand, or by firing a point-blank dispenser at a target. They are gray in color by default, but they adopt the design of any cape the player is wearing. They maintain their in-world texture design even when they're broken or enchanted.

### Flying
To fly, the player must press the jump key while falling, and the elytra spread apart like a beetle's wings. The player can aim their view around to turn or adjust their pitch. Losing altitude increases speed, and gaining altitude decreases speed. Firework rockets can be used to increase speed. Additionally, speed is quickly lost from sharp changes in direction.

Directly hitting any surface while gliding too fast causes damage to the player and their armor proportional to flight speed (although this may be calculated from another factor). When a player dies in this way, they receive the death message "<player> experienced kinetic energy". The player does not take fall damage from colliding at a shallow angle or a low enough speed. The critical, damaging angle is about 50° with the collision surface, and the calculation for damage seems to be as if the player had fallen from their maximum potential glide height to the height of the struck surface. 

A safe and simple cruise with the highest travel distance can be achieved by aiming directly at the horizon while at the glide's altitude limit. The player's speed is slow enough to allow them time to do other things during a long flight, like sort out their inventory.

In Creative mode or when the "mayfly" ability has been given, the player can alternatively hold the jump key to fly up,‌[Bedrock Edition  only] or double press the jump key to move around freely. 

Flight can be stopped by pressing the jump key.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

#### Speed and altitude
Elytra have a minimum speed of about 7.2 m/s (obtained by gliding at the altitude cap with a strong upward pitch of 30°). If the diver drops to 0 speed, they quickly get accelerated back up to at least this minimum. The diver can increase speed by choosing to descend faster, but afterward, they do not regain nearly as much altitude. In the real world, drag increases with speed, and drag, in turn, slows the aircraft; Minecraft mimics this. To glide from cliff to cliff, a player's best bet is to aim slightly above the horizon.

Sharp turns are a fast way to lose speed. Quicker turns cause greater losses, while gentle movements have small effects. Making a hairpin turn can actually be used for making high-speed landings safe as well as for precise landings on small targets like rooftops. The player aims to glide just above the target, then as they're right over it they immediately reverse directions, then they make readjustments as necessary.

The lowest rate of altitude loss is about 1.5 m/sec, obtained by gliding at the altitude cap with a slight upward pitch (12° or 15°).

To get the best possible glide ratio (and thus the furthest distance out of their altitude), the diver pilot should aim directly at the horizon. This ratio is about 9.47 to 1.

Slow Falling potions greatly decrease the player's vertical (fall) speed, which also greatly decreases their horizontal speed (clearly, it depends on the vertical fall rate, as one might expect from flight modeling). The net result is that the player flies extremely slowly - but their elytra still takes durability damage at the usual rate (1 durability per second without Unbreaking, etc.). Due to this combination, elytra plus Slow Falling is largely a novelty that most players won't use. The Feather Falling enchantment does not affect elytra speed and does not reduce fall damage from hitting things with elytra.

It is possible to calculate the glide range by dividing the altitude by tan of the glide angle (altitude/tan(glide angle)). For example, if the player glides from an altitude of 64 blocks above ground with a glide angle of 15 degrees, they can glide for 237 blocks (assume that they are on superflat), since floor(64 / tan(15)) is 237.
