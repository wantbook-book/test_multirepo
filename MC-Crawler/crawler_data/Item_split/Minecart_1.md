## Behavior
### Speed
Minecarts have a predefined speed limit of exactly 8 blocks per second per axis of travel. A minecart traveling diagonally can, therefore, travel up to 11.314 blocks per second.[2] When a minecart comes to a turn it moves diagonally across that turn.

Powered rails powered by redstone give minecarts a boost of speed. Speed is gradually decreased if there are no powered rails to assist its movement, and an unpowered powered rail slows down a minecart rapidly. The speed decreases at a faster rate when going uphill, compared to when moving horizontally. A minecart does not need powered rails to assist its movement down a hill.

Anything in the way of the minecart brings it to a stop. Once a minecart has left the track, it rapidly decelerates within one or two blocks. When mobs touch a minecart, they affect it in the same way a player would, i.e. mobs that move up against a still cart set it in motion.

If a minecart is moving fast enough, it can skip across one block without a track and reattach to track on the other side, at significantly reduced energy and speed. A minecart's hitbox can skip turns if the minecart is boosted using enough powered rails.[3]

The speed and momentum of a minecart can differ depending on whether or not it is empty, and in the case where a minecart has a container, the speed can differ depending on the quantity and type of items inside.

### Merged minecarts
In Java Edition, two or more minecarts can be merged by pushing them into each other so that they overlap. Merged minecarts move as a collective, like a train, and can be useful for long-distance transport because while moving in a straight line, they do not need powered rails to keep their speed.

To summarize:

- Minecarts can also be merged bydroppinga minecart on another minecart.
- Merged minecarts do not lose speed while traveling on straight rails
- Cornersin the rails might cause merged minecarts to unmerge.
- Minecarts withchest(even fully filled) can also be merged and also donotrequire powered rails.

### Distance traveled by empty carts starting on a downward slope
This table shows the distance traveled by an unoccupied minecart, in meters, on a downward slope, with a boost (or no boost). The most efficient way is to use only 1 boost at the bottom of the incline on the flat surface. Using 2 increases distance by about 20% or 1.5 blocks. All distance trends based on the height seem to be logarithmic.
The carts started from rest, on a slope Height blocks up.

| Height | No boost | Bottom | Bottom and top | All boosts on incline and bottom |
|--------|----------|--------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| 1      | 2.77     | 8.77   | 10.8           | 10.8                             |
| 2      | 4.59     | 9.59   | 10.83          | 13.37                            |
| 3      | 5.81     | 9.81   | 11.66          | 15.12                            |
| 4      | 7.04     | 10.04  | 12.46          | 16.95                            |
| 5      | 7.87     | 10.87  | 12.29          | 17.95                            |
| 10     | 11.65m   | 13.38  | 15.12          | 21.68                            |
| 100    | 15.87m   | 17.05  | 17.54          | 25.34                            |

### Collision
Minecarts are about the same size as a block (1×1). Because of this, a ladder, door, or trapdoor prevents it from falling down a 1×1 hole. Carts on rails also ignore collision in certain situations. A cart traveling uphill, downhill, or on a curve with a block placed in front of it, goes through the block.[4]

A minecart that reaches the end of a rail up against an opaque solid block bounces back, but if the block is transparent then it stops. The minecart can even bounce against an opaque block from a standstill if the rail underneath is powered. A player or mob riding in a minecart does not collide with or suffocate in any transparent blocks but suffocates inside opaque blocks.

Minecarts are completely unaffected by ice, packed ice, and blue ice[5]; they can also be destroyed by coming in contact with lava or fire.

### Mobs

  

This section is missing information about some other mobs that cannot be picked up by minecarts. 
Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page.


Minecart shaking due to being on top of an activator rail.
Mobs can ride minecarts, but cannot control them. Mobs cannot exit the minecart unless the minecart is destroyed or moves onto an active activator rail.[6] However, in Bedrock Edition, endermen are able to teleport out of minecarts.[7]

A mob can ride a minecart when pushing by a moving minecart on rails in Java Edition or when colliding with a minecart in Bedrock Edition. It is easier to pick up a mob when a minecart is turning. In Bedrock Edition, armor stands can also be picked up.

Most mobs (including cameras‌[BE & edu  only]) can be picked up by minecarts, except ender dragons, wardens, withers, NPCs, and agents. In Java Edition, iron golems and armor stands cannot be picked up either. This is much different from boats, which can be entered only by mobs smaller than the boats; even very large mobs like ghasts can enter minecarts.

A jockey riding a minecart automatically accelerates the minecart.[8] Mobs in minecarts don't despawn, and don't count toward the mob cap.‌[Java Edition  only][9]
