## Usage
Leggings can be placed in the 3rd armor slot of a player's inventory for activation.

### Defense points
Defense points are each signified by half of a shirt of mail in the armor bar above the health bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.

The following table shows the number of defense points added by leggings.

| Material | Defense points |
|----------|----------------|
| Leather  | 2 ()           |
| Golden   | 3 ()           |
| Chain    | 4 ()           |
| Iron     | 5 ()           |
| Diamond  | 6 ()           |
|          | Netherite      |

### Knockback resistance
Netherite leggings provide 10% knockback resistance.

### Durability
The following table shows the amount of damage each piece of armor can absorb before being destroyed.

Any "hit" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken but not protected by that armor (such as falling or drowning) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits leggings can endure.

Netherite armor is not damaged by lava or fire when worn.

| Material   | Durability |
|------------|------------|
| Leather    | 75         |
| Golden     | 105        |
| Chain/Iron | 225        |
| Diamond    | 495        |
| Netherite  | 555        |

### Armor trimming
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a pair of leggings, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, or diamond).

These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.

### Piglins
Piglins are attracted to golden leggings and pick them up, examining them for 6 to 8 seconds. Piglins can wear other leggings but are not attracted to them. They prefer stronger leggings over weaker leggings, with one exception: They always prefer golden leggings over all other leggings, throwing out stronger leggings in favor of gold leggings. Enchanted leggings are preferred over unenchanted leggings.
