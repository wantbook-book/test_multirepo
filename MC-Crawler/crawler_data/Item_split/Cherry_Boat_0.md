# Boat
A boat is a drivable vehicle entity used primarily for fast transport of players and passenger mobs over bodies of water. Bamboo rafts look different, but function almost identically to other boats.

## Obtaining
Boats can be crafted with any Overworld planks; crimson and warped planks cannot be used to make boats.[1]

Boats can be retrieved by repeatedly hitting them until they drop as an item.

Tools and weapons that deal more than 4 damage will instantly destroy a boat in one hit.â€Œ[Java Edition  only]

### Trading
Master-level fisherman villagers always offer to buy a boat for an emerald. The type of boat depends on the biome outfit type of the villager; plains villagers offer to buy oak boats, taiga and snowy villagers offer to buy spruce boats, savanna villagers offer to buy acacia boats, desert and jungle villagers offer to buy jungle boats, and swamp villagers offer to buy dark oak boats.

### Fuel
A boat used as fuel in a furnace lasts 60 seconds, smelting up to 6 items.

### Transportation

#### Entering
A player enters a boat by using it, if the boat is not fully occupied (boats can hold two entities). Unlike beds, there is no message above the hotbar for attempting to enter a fully occupied boat.[2]

#### Exiting
A boat can be exited by sneaking or, in Bedrock Edition, pressing down the right analog stick on a controller, tapping the "Leave Boat" button when using touch controls, or jumping. When exiting a boat, the player is placed in the direction the player is facing, or, if facing directly up or down, the player is placed in front of the boat. The exiting player is placed on land if possible from the dismounting position.

#### Motion
Boats do not turn with mouse-look. 

With a keyboard or gamepad, boats are controlled using the forward, left (turns left), right (turns right), and backward keys. Using the sprint key increases the field of vision, but does not increase speed as if sprinting.

With touchscreen controls, two buttons for steering appear. The right button or key steers to the left, and the left button or key steers to the right. Pressing both buttons or keys moves the boat forward.

In Java Edition, boats can be ridden against a current, but cannot be ridden upstream to a higher elevation. A boat lift, usually made from tripwire, pistons, and optionally a slime block, can be used to move a boat up. Bubble columns created with soul sand can also be used to push boats upward. These mechanisms can also be used in Bedrock Edition but are usually unnecessary because boats can be ridden upward in descending water, as well as follow upward stair-step currents.

## Behavior
### Speed
Boats move according to the player's control or water currents, with speed affected by the surface traversed. Boats move extremely quickly on ice,[3] allowing for the construction of fast transportation systems in any dimension.

| Substance                  | Speed         |
|----------------------------|---------------|
| Water                      | 8.0 blocks/s  |
| Ice,frosted ice,packed ice | 40 blocks/s   |
| Blue ice                   | 72.7 blocks/s |
| Land                       | 2.0 blocks/s  |
