#### Unit repair

A stone axe can be repaired in an anvil by adding either cobblestone, cobbled deepslate, or blackstone, with each block restoring 25% of the axe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two stone axes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the axe's enchantments.

## Usage
### Breaking
Stone axes can break wood-related blocks faster than other tools. Breaking a block costs 1 durability.[note 1]


↑ Blocks that break instantly don't use up durability.


### Stripping
Using a stone axe on a log, wood block, or block of bamboo turns it into a stripped log, stripped wood, or block of stripped bamboo, respectively. This costs 1 point of durability of the axe.

#### Copper blocks
Using a stone axe on a waxed or oxidized copper block removes the wax if it has any, or otherwise remove a level of oxidization. This costs 1 point of durability.

### Weapon
When used as a weapon, a stone axe loses 2 durability points.

#### Java Edition
Attacking a shield user with an axe disables the use of the shield for 5 seconds. Vindicators, piglin brutes, or other mobs with commands always disable the player's shield. Damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a sword of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to recover, resulting in lower DPS.

| Attack damage | Attack speed | Recovery time               | DPS | Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1] |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------------------|-----|-----------------------------------|
| 9             | 0.8          | 1.25 seconds (25game ticks) | 7.2 | 594× 297                          |


↑ The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because axes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.
