↑ a b c d e f All enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.

↑ a b c d Enchantment probabilities are the same as a level-20 to level-39 enchantment would be on an enchantment table that had no cap at level 30, and that was able to apply treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and where the chance of multiple enchantments is not reduced.

↑ a b The item has between 80% and 100% of its total durability.


### Mob loot
If a zombie, piglin, zombie pigman or skeleton is wearing armor, there is an 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop leggings upon death. The leggings are usually badly damaged and may be enchanted.

Vindicators and pillagers that spawn in raids have a chance to drop iron leggings, which are usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted.

### Trading
In Java Edition, novice-level armorer villagers have a 40% chance to sell iron leggings for 7 emeralds. Apprentice-level armorer villagers have a 50% chance to sell chainmail leggings for 3 emeralds. Expert-level armorer villagers always sell enchanted diamond leggings for 18-35 emeralds. Novice-level leatherworker villagers have a 2⁄3 chance to sell randomly dyed[note 1] leather pants for 3 emeralds.

Armorer villagers may give the players with the Hero of the Village effect chainmail leggings. ‌[Java Edition  only]
