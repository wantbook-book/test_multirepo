Toasts
- Added a new toast notification that appears every few seconds when the player has not yet opened their voting screen, and a vote proposal has started. The notification title is "New proposal received!" in purple text, while the main message differs depending on how long has passed since the first notification appeared.
	- Opening the voting screen once prevents these toasts from ever appearing in the future, unlessoptions.txtis edited externally.
	- These toasts use a value called "urgency" which has four values:LOW,MEDIUM,CONCERNING,WHY_ARE_YOU_NOT_DOING_IT.
	- They start atLOWurgency, which lasts 2 minutes, change toMEDIUMfor 2 minutes, then toCONCERNINGfor 1 minute and finally toWHY_ARE_YOU_NOT_DOING_ITuntil the world is closed or the voting screen is opened.
	- The notification's main message changes depending on the level of urgency.
		- AtLOWurgency, toasts appear every 15 seconds, last 5 seconds each and can have the following messages:
			- Pressvto open voting screen
			- To open voting screen, pressv
