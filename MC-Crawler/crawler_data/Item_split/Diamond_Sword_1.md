### Mob loot
Main article: Drops § Equipped items
Some mobs can spawn with a sword and have an 8.5% chance of dropping them upon death caused by player. This chance is increased by 1% per level of Looting, up to a maximum of 11.5% with Looting III. Zombies and husks can drop iron swords, zombified piglins and piglins can drop golden swords, and wither skeletons can drop stone swords. The dropped sword is usually badly damaged and may be enchanted. Stone swords dropped by wither skeletons are never enchanted.

A vex wields an iron sword that has a 0% chance of dropping without Looting. This chance increases by 1% per level of Looting. The sword is never damaged when the vex drops it in Java Edition, and sometimes it has enchantments when dropped.

In Bedrock Edition, pillagers and vindicators that spawn from raids have a 4.1% chance (or a 5.12% chance on Hard difficulty) of dropping a damaged iron sword. This sword has a 50% chance of being enchanted.[needs testing]

### Trading
The diamond sword trade of a weaponsmith.
In Bedrock Edition, an apprentice-level weaponsmith villagers sells enchanted iron swords for at least 7–21 emeralds, and a master-level weaponsmith sells enchanted diamond swords for at least 13–27 emeralds.

In Java Edition, a novice-level weaponsmith villager has a 2⁄3 chance of selling an enchanted iron sword for at least 7–22 emeralds. A master-level weaponsmith offers to sell an enchanted diamond sword for at least 11–27 emeralds.

The enchantments of the swords offered by villagers are the same as the ones obtained from an enchantment table at levels 5–19.

## Usage
### Attacking
Pressing attack while holding a sword inflicts damage on both mobs and other players. Upon damaging a mob or player, the sword's durability decreases by 1.

Attacking a boat or a minecart with a sword stone tier or higher instantly destroys it ‌[Java Edition  only], without decreasing the sword's durability. Otherwise, it requires 2 hits, with neither decreasing durability.

#### Sweeping

  

This feature is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


If the attack recharge meter is 84.8% or above and the player is on the ground standing or moving slower than the sprinting speed in a straight line, the sword performs a sweeping attack indicated by a gale particle that reaches nearby enemies for 1 and knocks them back; the amount of knockback is 80% that of the basal knockback and does not benefit from the Knockback enchantment. As result, the player can perform a sweep attack while they are sprinting diagonally but it is impossible to perform a sweep attack at the same time as a critical hit or while riding some entity. All enemies within an 1 by 0.25 by 1 block area of any part of the attacked mob and whose feet are 3 or less blocks away from player's feet are affected. The Sweeping Edge enchantment increases the damage dealt by 50% of the normal hit damage for level I, 67% for level II and 75% for level III.

### Damage
Main article: Damage
#### Java Edition
Swords have an attack speed of 1.6 and take 0.625 seconds to recover.

|-----------------------------------|----------|---------|------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Attack Damage                     | 4        | 4       | 5          | 6         | 7             | 8           |

| Durability                        | 59       | 32      | 131        | 250       | 1561          | 2031        |
| Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1] | 236× 118 | 128× 64 | 655× 327.5 | 1500× 750 | 10927× 5463.5 | 16248× 8124 |


↑ The formula to find the total lifetime damage is Lifetime damage minimum = Durability × Damage per hit. It ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes the sword is at maximum charge


#### Bedrock Edition
In Bedrock Edition, swords have no attack cooldown or sweep attack, and deal the following damage:

| Material                          | Wooden   | Gold      | Stone    | Iron        | Diamond     | Netherite   |
|-----------------------------------|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Attack Damage                     | 5        | 5         | 6        | 7           | 8           | 9           |
| Durability                        | 60       | 33        | 132      | 251         | 1562        | 2032        |
| Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1] | 300× 150 | 165× 82.5 | 792× 396 | 1757× 878.5 | 12496× 6248 | 18288× 9144 |


↑ The formula to find the total lifetime damage is Durability × Damage per hit = Lifetime damage minimum. It excludes enchantments and critical hits


The most amount of damage that a sword enchanted with Sharpness V can do is 11 in Java Edition and 15.25 in Bedrock Edition, without critical hits.

### Sword breaking times
Main article: Breaking
A sword can also be used to destroy certain blocks 50% quicker, sometimes much quicker than with fists. Using a sword to destroy any block that doesn't break instantly by hand decreases its durability by 2; this includes bamboo, despite that the sword is the fastest tool for breaking it.[1]

If a sword is enchanted with Silk Touch, either using Creative or commands, cobwebs the sword destroys will drop the cobwebs themselves instead of the usual string. This is due to the sword being classified as the proper tool for cobwebs.

The following table shows the time it takes to break blocks on which swords have any effect. Colors indicate what gets dropped:

- White: an original block.
- Blue: block's normal drop (e.g. seeds, sapling, apple).
- Red: nothing.
