#### Unit repair
Main article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair
Repair & NameDamaged Iron Axe
An iron axe can be repaired in an anvil by adding iron ingot, with each ingot restoring 25% of the axe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two iron axes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the axe's enchantments.

### Mob loot
#### Equipment
Main article: Drops § Equipped items
A vindicator spawns with an iron axe and has an 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II, and 11.5% with Looting III) of dropping it upon death by the player. It is usually heavily damaged and is sometimes enchanted.

#### Raids
In Bedrock Edition, Vindicator and pillagers that spawn in raids have a 4.1% chance (5.12% on hard) to drop a badly-damaged iron axe, which is sometimes enchanted with a random enchantment. A vindicator can drop 2 iron axes, one from natural equipment and one from raid drops.

## Usage
### Breaking
Iron axes can break wood-related blocks faster than other tools. Breaking a block costs 1 durability.[note 1]


↑ Blocks that break instantly don't use up durability.


### Stripping
Using an iron axe on a log, wood block, or block of bamboo turns it into a stripped log, stripped wood, or block of stripped bamboo, respectively. This costs 1 point of durability of the axe.

#### Copper blocks
Using an iron axe on a waxed or oxidized copper block removes the wax if it has any, or otherwise remove a level of oxidization. This costs 1 point of durability.
