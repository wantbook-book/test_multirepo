### Hooking mobs and other entities
See also: Fishing § Fishing rod durability

The fishing rod can be used to hook mobs, items‌[Java Edition  only] and some entities, including players. The fishing rod can then be reeled in, dragging the hooked object toward the player without dealing damage. Reeling in a mob or entity costs 5 points of durability, and reeling in an item costs 3 points. Reeling a mob pulls it toward the player with a speed of 1⁄10 the distance between mob and player.

Besides mobs and items, entities that can be reeled in include: 

- Boats
- Boat with Chests
- Minecartsof any type
- Armor Stands
- Shulker Bullets
- Fireballs

	- Sand
	- Gravel
	- Dragon Eggs
	- Concrete Powder

- Mobs riding/being ridden by other mobs (inBedrock Edition, the hooked mob dismounts)
- Paintings

Attempting to reel in said entities still costs durability to the rod.
