# Shield
A shield is a tool that can be used to block damage from melee attacks, ranged attacks and explosions. Shields can be temporarily disabled by getting hit with an axe, and some attacks ignore a shield's protection. Shields can have ornamental banner designs applied to them.

Shields may also be repaired on an anvil by using planks or another shield. Shields repaired on anvils retain their pattern.

### Trading
Journeyman-level armorer villagers have 1⁄3‌[BE  only]/2⁄5‌[JE  only] chance of selling a shield for 5 emeralds as their sixth trade.

## Usage
Despite using iron in its crafting recipe, it cannot be smelted into iron nuggets.[1]

### Defense
Shields are used for blocking incoming attacks. Using‌[JE  only] or sneaking‌[BE  only] causes a player to slow to a sneaking pace, and after 5 game ticks (0.25 seconds)[2], attacks coming from in front of the player are blocked, dealing no damage. When the shield blocks an attack of 3 or stronger, it takes durability damage equal to the strength of the attack rounded up. When a player enters a boat, their shields exhibit the blocking animation.  

Most blocked projectiles that carry status effects (such as shulker bullets‌[JE  only], flaming arrows, or tipped arrows) do not affect the blocker. Tridents & arrows can be deflected into other targets. Knockback from melee attacks and projectiles is prevented, while knockback from explosions, hoglin, and ravager attacks are significantly reduced.

The shield directionally blocks all attacks coming from within the FOV of the direction the wielder is facing, providing a full hemisphere of coverage to them.

Mobs that deal continuous contact damage such as the slime, magma cube, and blaze rapidly drain the shield's durability for as long as the shielded player remains within the mob's hitbox.[3][4]

Blockable attacks include:

- Melee attacks from all sources. When blocking melee attacks from axe-wielding mobs, axe-wielding players, andwardens, only a single attack can be blocked before a shield is disabled for 5 seconds.
	- Status effects do not carry through to the blocker.
- Normal, tipped, and spectralarrows
	- Arrows other thanPiercingare totally deflected and can hit other targets.
	- Status effects do not carry through to the blocker‌[JE  only].
		- This can be used to damage the attacker or another mob down there.
- Flaming arrows
	- Burning does not carry through to the blocker‌[JE  only].
- Tridents
- Snowballsandeggs
- Spines frompufferfish
- Bullets fromshulkers
	- The levitation effect does not carry through to the blocker‌[JE  only].
- Spit fromllamas
- Fireballs, such as fromblazesandfire charges
	- Burning does not carry through to the blocker.
- Direct hits fromghastfireballs
	- These still cause environmental damage.
- All explosions‌[JE  only]
- Explosion damage fromcreepers
- TNTthat another player lit
- Ravagerheadbutts
	- These still knock the blocker back by about 3 blocks.
	- Blocking these strikes can stun the ravager for a moment, and it roars afterward.
- Ravager roars are blocked but still knock back the blocker.
- Beestings are blocked, but bees continuously attack until the player stops blocking and the player is stung.
- Beam attacks fromguardiansorelder guardians(only reduces damage by 50%)

They cannot block:

- Arrows from acrossbowenchanted withPiercing
	- This does not reduce the shield's durability.
	- Direct projectile damage is blocked, but the effect still carries through.
- Status effects from splash/lingeringpotions,evokers' fangs, or breath from theender dragon
- Beam attacks fromguardiansorelder guardians, or thewarden's sonic boom attack
- TNT that the blocking player lit themselves‌[BE  only]
- TNT that aredstone mechanismlit‌[BE  only]
- Fall damage, including that fromender pearls
	- This also includes when the player rides anentitythat died due to fall damage.
