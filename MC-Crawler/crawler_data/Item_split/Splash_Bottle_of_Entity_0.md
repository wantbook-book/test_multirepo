## Obtaining
Bottle of void is obtained by drinking a glass bottle. Rule "drink_air" must be approved to enable that. Then, by using the bottle of void on a mob, a bottle of that mob is obtained. This can be turned into a splash bottle of that mob in a brewing stand with gunpowder, just like any other potion.
