## Obtaining
See also: Tutorials/Snow farming

### Mining
A shovel without the Silk Touch enchantment can get 4 snowballs by breaking a snow block, and 1–8 snowballs by breaking or blasting snow layers – one per layer. The Fortune enchantment does not affect these amounts.

In Bedrock Edition, snow layers drop snowballs when broken even when mined with a Silk Touch shovel.[1]

#### Explosions
Creeper and TNT explosions leave snowballs in the resulting debris field if near snow.

#### Ravagers
In Bedrock Edition, Ravagers destroy snow layers, dropping snowballs.

#### Pistons
In Bedrock Edition, a block or piston head pushed into the position of snow layers destroys the snow layers, dropping snowballs. 1-3 layers drops 1 snowball, 4-5 layers drops 2 snowballs, 6-7 layers drops 3 snowballs and 8 layers drops 4 snowballs.

### Mob loot
Snow golems drop 0–15 snowballs upon death, unaffected by Looting.

### Combat
Throwing a snowball on a pig animation.
Snowballs can be thrown by using them. There is no charging time or cooldown for firing them,‌[until JE Combat Tests] meaning they can be thrown as fast as the player can click.

Like other projectiles, snowballs are affected by gravity: their range is the same as those of eggs and ender pearls, less than that of arrows fired from bows, and more than that of splash potions.

Snowballs deal 3 each to blazes but they deal no damage to other mobs. Mobs still receive knockback and act the same as if they were being damaged (for example, zombified piglins who are hit by snowballs become aggressive). Players in Bedrock Edition receive knockback, while players in Java Edition are unaffected.[2]‌[until JE Combat Tests]

When fighting the ender dragon, end crystals are able to be destroyed by snowballs being thrown at them.

Snowball, like other projectiles, can be used to distract the warden. A warden walks toward the location where the snowball lands to inspect it, giving the player time to escape. However, if snowballs are fired too frequently (at least twice in 5 seconds), the warden walks straight to the player instead.

### Dispenser
Snowballs can be fired from dispensers.
