 DurationOnUse: The amount the duration of the field changes upon applying the effect.
 Effects: A list of the applied effects.
 An individual effect.
 Ambient: 1 or 0 (true/false) - whether or not this is an effect provided by a beacon and therefore should be less intrusive on the screen. Optional, and defaults to false. Due to a bug, it has no effect on splash potions.
 Amplifier: The amplifier of the effect, with level I having value 0.  Negative levels are discussed here. Optional, and defaults to level I.

 ShowParticles: 1 or 0 (true/false) - whether or not this effect produces particles. Optional, and defaults to true. Due to a bug, it has no effect on splash potions.
 Owner: The UUID of the entity who created the cloud, stored as four ints.
 Particle: The particle displayed by the field. This is the exact same as used in the /particle command, including additional parameters used for particles, for example dust 1 0 0 1.

 Radius: The field's radius.

 RadiusPerTick: The amount the radius changes per tick. Normally negative.
