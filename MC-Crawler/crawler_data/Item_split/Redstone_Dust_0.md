## Obtaining
### Breaking
Redstone dust can be broken instantly using any tool, or without a tool, and drops itself as an item.

Redstone dust is removed and drops as an item if:

- its attachment block is moved, removed, or destroyed
- waterorlavaflows into its space
- apistontries to push it or moves a block into its space

| Block    | Redstone Dust       |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 0                   |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.05                |

### Mining
See also: Redstone Ore § Natural generation

Redstone ore mined using an iron pickaxe or higher drops 4 or 5 redstone dust (or more with Fortune, averaging at 6 redstone dust with Fortune III). If mined with Silk Touch, the block drops itself instead of redstone dust. When the ore itself is clicked on/touched, it emits a light level of 9 and glows.

### Natural generation
15 lengths of redstone dust are naturally generated as part of the trap in each jungle pyramid. 5 lengths of redstone dust can be found in one type of a jail cell room in a woodland mansion. In ancient cities, multiple pieces of redstone dust can be found integrated into circuitry.

### Mob loot
Witches have a chance of dropping 0–2 redstone dust upon death. This is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0–5 redstone dust.
