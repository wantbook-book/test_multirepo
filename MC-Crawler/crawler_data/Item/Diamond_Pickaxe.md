Repair & NameDamaged Diamond Pickaxe
A diamond pickaxe can be repaired in an anvil by adding diamonds, with each diamond restoring 25% of the pickaxe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two diamond pickaxes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the pickaxe's enchantments.

↑ a b The item has between 10% and 50% of its total durability.

↑ a b Enchantment probabilities are the same as a level-20 to level-39 enchantment would be on an enchantment table that had no cap at level 30, and that was able to apply treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and where the chance of multiple enchantments is not reduced.

↑ a b c d All enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.

↑ a b The item has between 15% and 95% of its total durability.


### Trading
In Bedrock Edition, master-level toolsmith villagers always sell enchanted diamond pickaxe for 13 emeralds.

In Java Edition, master-level toolsmith villagers always sell an enchanted diamond pickaxe for 18–35 emeralds.

The enchantments are the same as the ones obtained from an enchantment table at levels 5–19.

## Usage
Main article: Pickaxe § Usage
### Mining
A diamond pickaxe is used to break stone and metal-based materials faster. Breaking a block with a diamond pickaxe consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that have a hardness value of 0, such as torches and flowers.

A diamond pickaxe or better is required to mine the following blocks:

- Obsidian
- Crying Obsidian
- Respawn Anchor
- Ancient Debris
- Block of Netherite

### Weapon
#### Java Edition
All pickaxes have an attack speed modifier of -2.8, meaning they take about 0.83 seconds to recover. Diamond pickaxes do 5 damage per attack, or 6 damage per second.

#### Bedrock Edition
All pickaxes attack instantly, with diamond pickaxes doing 6 damage per attack.

### Enchantments
A diamond pickaxe can receive the following enchantments:

| Name               | Description                                             | Max level | Method                | Weight |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------|--------|

| Curse of Vanishing | The pickaxe vanishes on death, not dropping as an item. | I         | Anvil                 | 1      |


↑ a b Silk Touch and Fortune are mutually exclusive


### Upgrading
Like other diamond tools, a diamond pickaxe can be upgraded to a netherite pickaxe, increasing its durability and slightly increasing its mining speed, as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item. The upgraded pickaxe will keep its enchantments, name and other item data.
