## Obtaining
### Block loot
See also: Pumpkin and melon farming

Melon slices can be obtained by breaking (harvesting) melons using any tool or by hand. Axes, followed by swords, are the fastest tools for harvesting melons.  A melon drops 3–7 melon slices, when broken; by hand, using a tool, or after being broken by the movement of a piston, with an average of 4.64 slices per melon.

Breaking a melon with a tool enchanted with Fortune increases the potential number of drops by 1 slice per level, up to a maximum of 9 slices.

## Usage
### Food
