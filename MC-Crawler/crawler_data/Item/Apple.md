## Obtaining
### Block loot
Oak and dark oak leaves have 0.5% (1⁄200) chance of dropping an apple when decayed or broken, but not if burned. Breaking leaves with a tool enchanted with the Fortune enchantment increases the chances of dropping an apple: 0.556% (1⁄180) with Fortune I, 0.625% (1⁄160) with Fortune II, and 0.833% (1⁄120) with Fortune III.
