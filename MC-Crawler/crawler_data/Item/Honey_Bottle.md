### Harvesting
A honey bottle can be obtained by using a glass bottle on either a beehive or bee nest with a honey level of 5. Doing this angers any bees inside, causing them to attack the player, unless there is a campfire or another block on fire within 5 blocks below the nest or hive. Using normal fire would likely cause the nest, bees, and flowers around it to burn.

A dispenser with glass bottles can be used to collect the honey without angering the bees. The honey bottle appears as an item in the dispenser's inventory. If the dispenser is full, the honey bottle is shot out.

## Usage
To drink a honey bottle, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Drinking one restores 6 () hunger and 1.2 hunger saturation and returns a glass bottle. Consuming the item also has the benefit of removing any Poison effect applied to the player. Unlike drinking milk, other applied effects are not removed upon drinking a honey bottle.

Honey bottles can be drunk even with a full hunger bar. Drinking a honey bottle takes 25% longer than eating other food - 2 seconds - and has a unique sound.
