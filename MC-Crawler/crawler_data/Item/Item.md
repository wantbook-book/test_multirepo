## Behavior
Some items, when used, place a block (ItemBlock) or entity (minecart, spawn eggs, etc.) version of themselves into the game world. Put simply, they are an item when in the inventory, and a block when placed. For example, boats turn into an entity when placed, and beds turn into a group of blocks when placed. When selected in the hotbar, items briefly display their names above the HUD.

The only method by which an item can be properly displayed within the game environment is to place it into an item frame.

If an item that does not become a block is dropped, it becomes an entity represented by a sprite that floats above the ground for 5 minutes in a loaded chunk before despawning, unless the player walks over it to pick it up before it despawns, it is picked up by a mob, hopper or minecart with hopper, or it is destroyed by fire, lava, cactus, or explosions.

A submerged object ascends toward the water’s edge. When the surface current is in motion, the object is propelled along with it.

Hoppers draw in any items that are placed above them.

### Stacking
Items can either stack up to 64 or 16, or not stack at all:

- Most items can stack to 64. This includes allblocks, and most items.
- Some other items, such assnowballs, emptybuckets,eggs,signsandender pearls, can stack up to a maximum of 16.
- Some items do not stack at all, such anything with adurability(weapons,armor, andtools), filledbuckets, andpotions.
- All items can technically be forced to stack up to 127 usingcommands.
