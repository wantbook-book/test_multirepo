## Obtaining
A bucket of tadpole can be obtained by using a water bucket on a tadpole. Once a water bucket is used, the tadpole is picked up along with the water source block.

## Usage
Pressing use with a bucket of tadpole places a water source block, and spawns the tadpole back into the world, leaving an empty bucket in the player's inventory. Placing a bucket of tadpole in the Nether causes the same particles to appear that generate when a normal water bucket is placed in the Nether, and the tadpole is spawned alone.

Tadpoles caught in buckets then released do not despawn, unlike mobs that spawn naturally in their aquatic environments. However, they still grow into frogs.

If a bucket of tadpole is inside a dispenser, the dispenser spawns the tadpole and water block in front of it upon activation, leaving an empty bucket inside. Dispensers cannot pick up tadpoles with water buckets (the bucket is emptied).

If a bucket of tadpole is named a certain name through an anvil, the tadpole inside displays that name as if it were named with a name tag.‌[Java Edition  only] Alternatively, if a named tadpole is captured with a bucket of water, the resulting bucket of tadpole shares a name with the captured tadpole.‌[Java Edition  only] If a named tadpole is captured in Bedrock Edition, the item is called "Bucket of <Name>".
