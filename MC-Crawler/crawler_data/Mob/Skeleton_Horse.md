# Skeleton Horse
A skeleton horse is an undead variant of the horse. It sometimes spawns when lightning strikes, causing four horsemen to appear if the trap horse is approached.

## Spawning
A group of skeleton horsemen spawned by a "skeleton trap" horse.
A skeleton horseman consisting of a skeleton and a skeleton horse.
A “skeleton trap horse” is a defensive skeleton horse spawned from a fraction of lightning generated naturally by a thunderstorm (0.75–1.5% chance on Easy, 1.5–4% on Normal, and 2.25–6.75% on Hard, depending on regional difficulty). In Java Edition, the lightning that spawns a trap horse doesn't strike nearby entities or spawn fires. Lightning strikes caused by a Channeling-enchanted trident and lightning strikes on a lightning rod never spawn a skeleton trap horse. The trap horse despawns after 15 minutes if not triggered (even if it is named).

The skeleton trap horse is triggered when a player comes within 10 blocks of it, resulting in a lightning strike that does not start fires or damage nearby entities. When struck, the skeleton trap horse transforms into a skeleton horseman: a skeleton riding a skeleton horse. It also spawns three additional skeleton horsemen in the vicinity.

The skeleton is equipped with an enchanted iron helmet and an enchanted bow. In Java Edition both the horse and horseman have damage immunity for 3 seconds after spawning. In Bedrock Edition, both the horse and horseman are always immune to lightning. The skeleton horse cannot spawn in the mushroom fields[1] and in peaceful mode[2], similar to hostile and neutral monsters.

Trap skeleton horse can be spawned in Java Edition using the command /summon skeleton_horse ~ ~ ~ {SkeletonTrap:1}, or in Bedrock Edition using the command /summon skeleton_horse ~ ~ ~ minecraft:set_trap.

## Drops
### On death
| Item |      | Roll Chance | Quantity (Roll Chance) |           |            |             |
|------|------|-------------|------------------------|-----------|------------|-------------|

- 1–3 when killed by a player ortamed wolf.

If saddled, it drops a saddle.‌[Java Edition  only]

Killing a baby skeleton horse yields no items or experience. In Bedrock Edition, killing a trap skeleton horse also yields no items or experience.

## Usage
See also: Transportation

Skeleton horses can be ridden by one player, as a normal horse, and are one of fastest means of transportation in the game. When ridden, they can also be used to climb hills and jump fences because the skeleton horses can jump up to five block heights, versus the player's maximum of one (without jump boost).

They can be ridden in water in any depth. Skeleton horses sink in the water and can be ridden along the ocean or river floor.

Skeleton horses can be pulled or tethered with a lead.

### Equipment
GUI of a skeleton horse.‌[JE  only]
Java Edition
Skeleton horses have the following slot available:

- Saddle Slot: For equipping asaddle.

Saddles can be placed on a tamed skeleton horse by holding it and then using on the skeleton horse, or by accessing its inventory. A skeleton horse’s inventory can be accessed by mounting the skeleton horse and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using on the skeleton horse.

Baby skeleton horses cannot be equipped.

Bedrock Edition
A skeleton horse does not have an inventory and cannot be equipped with a saddle or armor. Despite this, the default texture file, like those of normal horses, donkeys and mules, includes a chest.

### Riding
Main article: Riding
In Bedrock Edition, skeleton horses can be controlled by the player without a saddle. However, in Java Edition, skeleton horses can be equipped with a saddle and then controlled. Like riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a skeleton horse.

The player can control a tamed (and saddled Java Edition) skeleton horse with standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse. The player dismounts using the dismount control.

A player controlled skeleton horse automatically runs up any one block high slope. The skeleton horse and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high. Lower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block. The horse itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks. Skeleton horses cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.

Player controlled skeleton horses have the ability of "jumping charging". When the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar. A controlled skeleton horses can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap. Skeleton horses are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.

Unlike normal horses, a skeleton horse does not force the player to dismount when it is under water; rather, it can be ridden underwater without drowning. The player can still drown underwater without the proper potions or enchantments, even when mounted on the skeleton horse. When underwater, its running speed and jump remain the same although it has a slower rate of descent.

## Behavior
The skeleton horse is an undead mob that is initially defensive when it spawns and triggers a skeleton trap horse if the player gets too close, but once the skeleton rider is defeated, the skeleton horse becomes completely passive. Skeleton horses behave like normal horses, roaming idly and occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass. Unlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed. Skeleton horses can breathe in water.

Unlike other passive mobs, skeleton horses slowly regenerate health evident by their health bar while the player rides it. This is the same case for normal horses.

Skeleton horses cannot be bred, however, in Java Edition, skeleton horses can be fed while being ridden by the skeleton, the valid food items are the same as for the normal horse: sugar, wheat, normal/gold/enchanted apples, golden carrots, and hay bales. 

Being an undead mob, they are: 

- damaged by the status effectInstant Healthand healed by the status effectInstant Damage.
- unaffected by the status effectsRegenerationandPoison.
- ignored by thewither.
- affected by theSmiteenchantment.
- a threat toarmadillos, causing them to hide in their shell.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80]

Other notes:

- The skeleton wears an iron helmet, unless it randomly spawned with some other headgear.
- The skeleton's bow and helmet are enchanted as if on anenchanting tableat level 5–22. The exact level depends onregional difficulty; on Easy it is always a level-5 enchantment.
- The skeleton trap horse and the skeleton horse in a jockey are always adult. InBedrock Edition, the skeleton trap horse is not an adult nor a baby, though it looks like an adult.
	- Baby skeleton horses can be spawned with aspawn egg. Baby skeleton horses cannot grow up normally InBedrock Edition.
- The skeleton in a naturally spawned skeleton horseman jockey does not despawn.
- A trap horse may spawn in areas that a regular horse may not, such as the middle of an ocean.
- A trap horse can trigger normally in clear weather (and often a player encounters a trap horse after the thunderstorm has cleared).
- The skeleton drops more experience orbs.
- The skeleton does not shoot any mob that attacks the skeleton horse.
- InBedrock Edition, skeleton horses are killed by theconduitlike any regular hostile mob, despite being tamed.[3]

### Taming
In Bedrock Edition, the skeleton horse is always tamed. In Java Edition, a skeleton trap horse becomes tamed when struck by lightning. The other three skeleton horses are tamed when they are spawned.

In Java Edition, with the use of commands, a skeleton horse can be tamed in the same way as a regular horse, granting the Best Friends Forever advancement:/ride @s mount @e[type=minecraft:skeleton_horse,limit=1]. A tamed skeleton horse can also be summoned using /summon minecraft:skeleton_horse ~ ~ ~ {Tame:1b}.

## Statistics
See also: Tutorials/Horses

All horses have three "equine stats" that vary from horse to horse: health, maximum movement speed, and jump strength. These stats are created once the horse is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.

### Spawned values
When spawned in any way except breeding – for instance, using commands, spawning naturally, spawning as part of a skeleton trap, or using spawn eggs – horses are assigned their stats within certain ranges, specific according to their horse type.

#### Health
A skeleton horse's health is always 15. Displayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down. A horse with an odd number of health points (15, 17, 19, etc.) does not show the last half-heart. If the horse has lost one health point lower than the inflicted damage and did not regenerate, it has an odd number of health points, otherwise, it has an even number of health points.

#### Movement speed
Skeleton horse's speed is always 0.2;
the player's normal walking speed is 0.1. The speed listed does not include any status effect that affects the speed of a horse or a player.

See transportation to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.

#### Jump strength
Jump strength ranges from 0.4–1.0, averaging 0.7.

A jump strength of 0.5 is enough to clear 1 19⁄32 blocks, while 1.0 is enough to clear 5 9⁄32 blocks.

The jump strengths required to clear several block heights are:

| Jump Strength | Blocks                      |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| 0.967         | 5.00                        |
| 0.848         | 4.00                        |
| 0.716         | 3.00                        |
| 0.565         | 2.00                        |
| 0.431         | 1.25 (player's jump height) |
