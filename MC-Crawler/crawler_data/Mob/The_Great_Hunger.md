## Community events
Announced at the same time were official community events, hosted by community-led partners such as Minefaire, Minevention and Blockfest. These partners (along with many more to come) have gained the official stamp of approval to throw authentic in-person Minecraft experiences. Attendees will get to meet their favorite YouTubers and streamers, compete in tournaments and costume contests, see unique content and more.[2]

## Mob Vote
The four options of a new mob that will be voted into the game.
Watchers were able to vote for a new mob to be added into the game, out of 4 options (pictured). People were able to vote via a Twitter poll, and the three mobs that did not win the vote were not implemented.[3]

### Mob A

Mob A, the Barnacle,[4] also called "The Monster of the Ocean Depths", is a Squid-like ocean creature that sucks players down with its tentacle. The mob spawns in the Deep Ocean biome and has a large mouth that it uses to propel itself through the water. Jeb says that viewers should vote for Mob A because there is currently not a lot of content in the oceans, and it would make a good challenge for players traveling across the ocean.[5] Mob A was eliminated after the first poll.

1.13 however, added whirlpools generated from magma blocks, serving a similar purpose.




### Mob B

Mob B, the Phantom, at the time known as "The Monster of the Night Skies", is a flying creature that seeks out and attacks players who haven't slept for 3 days. It spawns at high altitudes in the air, and attacks in groups. Jeb says that viewers should vote for Mob B because there were no flying monsters in the Overworld yet.[6] Mob B won the vote, and was first added into the game in Java Edition 1.13 snapshot 18w07a, with the name of Phantom.




### Mob C

Mob C, "The Great Hunger", is a lizard-like creature that sinks into the ground, camouflages itself and consumes mobs and items with its huge mouth. It has a "great appetite for enchanting powers" and Jeb says that viewers should vote for Mob C because players may be able to use the mob's abilities to add or remove enchantments for players' own items.[7] Mob C was eliminated after the third poll.

The ability to remove enchantments was later added in the form of the grindstone block.




### Mob D

Main article: MCD:Wildfire
Mob D, The Wildfire, called "The Hovering Inferno" during the vote, is a type of blaze. Its body parts look like shields and are used to defend itself from attack. This mob spawns with groups of blazes randomly and attacks the player in the Nether with its dangerous shock wave attack. Jeb says that viewers should vote for Mob D because it would make the Nether "even more scary and exciting".[8] Mob D was eliminated after the second poll.

It was later planned to be a part of the Flames of the Nether DLC for Minecraft Dungeons, but was cut due to time constraints. A statue of it still appears in the Nether Fortress mission in that game. It was then added as a mob in the Luminous Night seasonal adventure.


### Results
At 30 minutes into the event, Mob A lost the vote and was eliminated. 30 minutes after that, Mob D was also eliminated. After 20 more minutes, Mob B won the vote, eliminating mob C. Mob B has been released alongside Java Edition and Legacy Console Edition Update Aquatic and alongside Bedrock Edition 1.6.0.
