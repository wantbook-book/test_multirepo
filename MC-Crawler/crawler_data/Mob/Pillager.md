## Spawning
In Java Edition, a pillager spawned by a player using a spawn egg or commands can be a captain, which has an ominous banner sticking out of its head.

### Patrols
In Java Edition, the number of pillagers spawning in each patrol varies from one to five and depends on the regional difficulty, with one spawning as a patrol captain. Patrols occur after 51⁄2 in-game days, any time and independently of structures, which means they still spawn in worlds without generated structures. A patrol spawns 24 to 48 blocks away from a random player, on the highest solid block. The individual pillagers of a patrol can spawn only at block light level less than 9, regardless of sky light.

In Bedrock Edition, each patrol spawns two to five pillagers. One of these pillagers is a patrol captain. After 51⁄2 in-game days, patrols appear 24 to 48 blocks away from the player, at a light level of 7 and below on Easy or any light level on Normal and Hard difficulty.

### Outposts
Pillagers continually spawn in a 72×54×72 block volume centered on the top floor in a pillager outpost. Some pillagers spawn as outpost captains. They may spawn on any valid opaque block if the block light level is less than or equal to 8. 

In Java Edition, there can be unlimited pillagers that spawn in outposts naturally, limited only by the natural spawning rules.

In Bedrock Edition, pillagers continually spawn at or below a particular location in the outpost, choosing the highest opaque block with a non-solid block on top and spawning on the northwest corner. A maximum of eight pillagers spawn naturally in an outpost.

### Raids
In a raid, pillagers are more common in the earlier waves and decrease in number as the waves progress. Despite this, they still constitute the majority of raiders in total. 

One pillager spawns riding a ravager in the fifth wave. 

In Bedrock Edition, one of the ravagers is ridden by a pillager instead of a vindicator on the seventh wave.

In Java Edition, pillagers spawn during bonus waves and have the largest chance of being the raid captain in the first wave, but in the second wave and onward, vindicators have a greater chance than pillagers of being the raid captain.

## Drops
A pillager drops upon death:

- InBedrock Edition, pillagers drop 0 - 2arrows. Each level of theLootingenchantment increases the maximum number of arrows dropped for up to five.
- There is a 8.5% chance to drop acrossbowwhen killed by theplayeror a tamedwolf. The crossbow may be loaded or unloaded depending on the crossbow's state when the pillager dies. The drop chance increases by 1% per level ofLooting. The crossbow is of a randomdurabilityand has a chance of being enchanted. The chance ranges from 0% to 10% depending on theregional difficulty. The enchantment level is from 5 to 19.
- 5experiencepoints and an additional1–3 points per naturally-spawned equipment when killed by the player or a tamed wolf, if the pillager does not drop their naturally-spawned equipment.
- Itsillagerominous bannerif spawned as acaptain.

In Bedrock Edition, pillagers that were spawned by raids have a 65% chance on easy and normal or 80% chance on hard difficulties to drop these:

- 0–1Emerald(10⁄39or 25.6%)
- 2–3Emerald(5⁄39or 12.8%)
- 4–5Emerald(2⁄39or 5.1%)
- 1Enchanted Book(2⁄39or 5.1%)
- 1Iron Pickaxe(5⁄78or 6.4%)
- 1Iron Axe(5⁄78or 6.4%)
- 1Iron Shovel(5⁄78or 6.4%)
- 1Iron Sword(5⁄78or 6.4%)
- 1Iron Helmet(5⁄78or 6.4%)
- 1Iron Chestplate(5⁄78or 6.4%)
- 1Iron Leggings(5⁄78or 6.4%)
- 1Iron Boots(5⁄78or 6.4%)
	- Theironequipment drops have a 50% chance to beenchantedat level 5 to 19. Said equipment may also have enchantment combinations that cannot be normally obtained, such asBlast ProtectionandFire Protectionon the same pair of boots.
	- Iron equipment drops are always of 30 to 90% itemdurability.
	- These drops are affected by theLootingenchantment.
	- Enchanted bookshave level 30 enchantments, which can also be treasure enchantments.

## Behavior
Pillagers are hostile toward players, iron golems, wandering traders and adult villagers. Pillagers also aid other pillagers attacked by other mobs. In Bedrock Edition, a pillager that accidentally harms a vindicator or evoker causes it to retaliate and attack the pillager.[1] In Java Edition, pillagers do not retaliate on vindicators or evokers that attack them.

Pillagers do not attack players in Creative mode. A pillager also does not attack if summoned with commands in Bedrock Edition using the minecraft:calm attribute.

When a player is in Creative mode or applied with the Invisibility effect, getting near a pillager still causes it to take notice and stare at the player. If a pillager notices an enemy while staring at the player, the pillager stops staring and attacks the enemy. If a player with the invisibility effect attacks a pillager, the pillager still retaliates.

A pillager attacks by shooting arrows from its crossbows every three seconds from up to eight blocks away and pursues enemies for up to 64 blocks in Java Edition or 16 blocks in Bedrock Edition.

Pillagers move slowly when wandering or loading crossbows in Java Edition. In Bedrock Edition, pillagers move from one place to another as fast as when they're provoked, although they stop and look around, pointing their crossbows along. Pillagers point their crossbows at any player or mob they are looking at, whether their crossbows are loaded or unloaded.

A pillager stares at the player and points its crossbow toward the player when the player is in creative mode or when the player has the invisibility status effect.
The patrol captain wears an ominous banner, known as the illager banner in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, on its head. The other illagers follow the captain around. The pillagers that are part of a patrol do not attack immediately. The patrol members' heads turn to follow the player or mob who attracted their attention. If the player or villager-like mob attacks or approaches within ten blocks of the patrol members, then this provokes them into loading their crossbows and attacking.[2]

If raiding pillagers kill all the villagers in a village, they celebrate their victory by jumping and laughing. Unarmed pillagers also cheer. In Bedrock Edition, pillagers wave their arms while holding their crossbows in their main hand when cheering.

Pillagers can take and equip illager banners within 3 blocks, but non-raider pillagers do not search for ominous banners.

In Java Edition, if a pillager gets attacked by a mob (excluding illagers and goats) or player, it alerts other pillagers to target the attacker unless the pillager was killed in one hit.

### Crossbow usage
#### Java Edition
Pillagers can also use crossbows in their off-hand. When a pillager finds a target, the pillager chases the target, then locks the target in its attack range and loads its crossbow.

Pillagers with their crossbows loaded can attack at any blocks away if the target is out of their attack range.

Pillagers, unlike evokers or vindicators, attack on sight, not regarding distance, although attacking a pillager, vindicator or evoker far away causes the attacked illager and the same type of illagers around the attacked illager to attack the player regardless of distance. 

The command /summon pillager ~ ~ ~ {} summons a passive pillager that does not attack.

A pillager's crossbow eventually breaks with repeated use, unlike weapons wielded by other mobs.[3] Unarmed pillagers are passive toward the player, iron golems and villagers, but they still frighten villagers and iron golems are still hostile toward them. This also includes pillagers that don't have a crossbow, which means any pillagers with a sword or any weapon other than a crossbow are still passive. An unarmed pillager always faces any player in its field of view or any mob that attacks it.

A pillager spawned with arrows or firework rockets in its off-hand slot uses them, depleting the stack over time and switching to regular arrows once running out of ammunition.[4] When firing firework rockets, pillagers aim above the target as when using arrows, despite rockets being unaffected by gravity.[5]

#### Bedrock Edition
Pillagers cannot use their crossbows in their off-hand, as mobs cannot use weapons in their off-hand, just like players.

The differences between the pillager texture in Java Edition (left) and Bedrock Edition (right).
Pillagers use an outdated behavior.[6][7] They also have different arm textures.[8] Pillagers load their crossbows upon spawning or if their crossbows are unloaded. When a pillager finds a target, it loads its crossbow first, chases the target and attacks upon in range. Pillagers are not hostile to players before their crossbows are loaded, so sometimes they don't look at players or run around while loading their crossbows. 

A dispenser can equip a pillager with armor. However, an armor item isn't rendered on pillagers.

If a player summons a pillager without a crossbow by spawn event command, it still shoots arrows to attack targets, like other arrow-shooting ranged mobs. This is due to the fact that in the pillager.json and ranged piglin.json files, the component_groups have both minecraft:behavior.ranged_attack and minecraft:behavior.charge_held_item, so if a pillager does not have a crossbow, the charge_held_item behavior cannot trigger and it continuously shoots arrows due to the ranged_attack behavior.

Unlike in Java Edition, the crossbows of pillagers in Bedrock Edition don't break.[9]

Pillagers use a melee attack while underwater, unlike pillagers in Java Edition that maintain using crossbows underwater, although the shot arrows travel slower underwater and sink after a short distance.

## Bad Omen
A player receives the Bad Omen status effect when they kill a pillager captain, wearing an ominous (or illager) banner on its head. The effect lasts for 100 minutes (five in-game days) and can be removed by drinking milk. When a player afflicted with Bad Omen enters a village, a raid commences in that village, bringing about waves of illagers that seek and try to kill all villagers.

Each patrol spawns one pillager captain. While outposts can continually spawn pillager captains, each captain inflicts the player who killed it with one level of Bad Omen upon death. 

Raid captains do not inflict Bad Omen when defeated in a raid. 

In Java Edition, killing multiple captains in succession raises the Bad Omen level to a maximum of V, increasing the chance of pillagers and vindicators in the resulting raid wielding enchanted weapons. As long as the Bad Omen level is higher than I, the resulting raid includes an additional wave with a raider composition identical to that of the last wave.
