# Turtle
A turtle (in Java Edition), also known as a sea turtle (in Bedrock Edition), is a common passive mob found in beach biomes. They are the only source of turtle scutes, which drop from baby turtles when they mature into adults.

## Spawning
Turtles occasionally spawn in small groups, on the sand in beaches in the Overworld, but not in snowy beaches or stony shores.

Turtles have a 10% chance to spawn as babies.

In Java Edition, turtles spawn in groups of up to 5 individuals, at light levels greater than 8, on sand blocks less than 4 blocks above sea level.

In Bedrock Edition, turtles spawn in groups of 2–6, in light levels of 7 and higher, at Y=60–67.

## Drops
### Breeding
Upon successful breeding, 1–7 is dropped.

Baby turtles do not drop anything when they die.

### Growth
When a baby turtle grows up to an adult it drops:

## Behavior
Turtles can both move around on land and swim in water. They move slowly on land, but they can swim at a fast speed in the water. Like other passive mobs, they move around aimlessly and flee when attacked. When on land, they generally attempt to move to the nearest water source. When in an enclosed area, such as a player-made enclosure, they generally swim in circles if the water is in the area, and rarely go on land to explore, if there is any.

Turtles cannot be attached to leads,[1] but they can be led by a player holding seagrass within 10 blocks of the turtle.

Turtles can be picked up by boats and minecarts.

Turtles are killed instantly when struck by lightning.

As with other aquatic mobs, turtles suffer extra damage when hit by a trident with the Impaling enchantment in Java Edition, and cannot drown, despite the fact that real-life turtles breathe air.

### Predators
Turtles and turtle eggs are attacked by the following mobs:

Zombies and their variants deliberately trample on turtle eggs, causing them to break.


↑ a b Unlike zombies, zombified piglins, and their variants, withers and ravagers do not intentionally break turtle eggs but are able to break turtle eggs if they are in its way.


### Home position
A turtle remembers the block on which it spawned as its home position. No matter how far away the turtle is, it always attempts to return to its home position to lay its eggs after breeding.

If the player uses a tool enchanted with Silk Touch to obtain and move turtle eggs to a new location before hatching, the baby turtles remember the new hatching location as their home beach.

If a turtle is spawned from a spawn egg, summoned with the /summon command, or spawned by a monster spawner, it remembers the spawn location as its home position.

A turtle digs sand around the block on which it lays its eggs.
### Breeding
A turtle lays eggs after digging.
Feeding two turtles seagrass results in them entering love mode and one of the turtles becoming pregnant. The pregnant turtle has eggs in its body and is therefore about 0.2 blocks taller than normal.

#### Egg laying
The turtle then travels back to its home position, which is where it first spawned. The turtle will not stop travelling until is is within a 9-block distance from its home position. Upon arrival, it seeks a nearby sand block on which to lay its eggs. Then, it spends a few seconds digging vigorously while turning 360 degrees a few times. Finally, it lays a cluster of 1–4 turtle eggs, as a single block. Turtles have a cooldown of 90 seconds (1800 game ticks) after breeding in Bedrock Edition, or 5 minutes (300 seconds; 6000 game ticks) in Java Edition.

#### Egg hatching
Main article: Turtle Egg § Hatching
Turtle eggs can be placed on any block in clusters of up to 4, however, they hatch only on sand, red sand, or suspicious sand, above or below water. Eggs can be broken without tools and can also be trampled by living entities falling or walking on them. When a cluster is trampled, the eggs crack and break one at a time. A turtle can walk on turtle eggs without breaking them.

Turtle eggs progress toward hatching by cracking. Cracking occurs during random ticks, and an egg hatches once it has cracked 3 times. When a cluster of eggs hatches, all eggs within the block hatch simultaneously. Eggs grow faster during the night and typically take 4 to 5 in-game days to hatch. Mining a cluster of turtle eggs with Silk Touch causes it to drop one egg at a time, which the player can collect. Eggs do not preserve the cracking stage when harvested.

### Babies
With a height of 0.12 blocks, baby turtles are among the smallest mobs in the game. Baby turtles are small enough that when they walk on soul sand, they are entirely within the space at the top of the block.

Upon hatching, baby turtles search for the nearest water block within a 47×1×47 region two blocks below the turtle and attempt to approach it.

Baby turtles take one Minecraft day to grow up (20 minutes). The growth can be accelerated using seagrass. Each use reduces the remaining growth duration by 10%. Upon becoming an adult, the turtle drops a turtle scute.
