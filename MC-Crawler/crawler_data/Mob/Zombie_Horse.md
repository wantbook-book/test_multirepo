## Usage
See also: Transportation


  

This feature is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


Tamed and saddled zombie horses can be used as one of the fastest means of transportation in the game. They can also be used to climb hills and jump fences.

In Bedrock Edition, they cannot be ridden.

### Equipment

Zombie horses have a lone equipment slot.

- Saddle slot: For equipping asaddle.

In Bedrock Edition, they have no slot.

### Riding
Main article: Riding
Once a horse is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with directional controls, jump, and the mouse. The player dismounts using the dismount control. Like riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a horse.

A ridden horse automatically runs up any one-block-high slope. The horse and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high. Lower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block. The horse itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks. Horses cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.

Ridden saddled zombie horses have the ability of "jumping charging". When the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar. A ridden saddled zombie horses can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap. Zombie horses are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.

## Behavior
The zombie horse is an undead mob that is completely passive. Zombie horses behave like normal horses, roaming idly and occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass. Unlike sheep and like other horses, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed. Zombie horses can breathe in water.

Unlike other passive mobs, zombie horses slowly regenerate health. In Bedrock Edition zombie horses will be killed by the Conduit like any regular hostile mob, despite being passive.

Zombie horses cannot be bred, however, in Java Edition, tamed zombie horses can be fed while being ridden by another mob, the valid food items are the same as for the normal horse: sugar, wheat, normal/gold/enchanted apples, golden carrots, and hay bales.

Being an undead mob, they are: 

- damaged by the status effectInstant Healthand healed by the status effectInstant Damage.
- unaffected by the status effectsRegenerationandPoison.
- ignored by thewither.
- affected by theSmiteenchantment.
- a threat toarmadillos, causing them to hide in their shell.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80]

### Taming
Zombie horses cannot be tamed normally. However, in Java Edition, with the use of commands, a zombie horse can be tamed in the same way as a regular horse, granting the Best Friends Forever advancement: /ride @s mount @e[type=minecraft:zombie_horse,limit=1]. A tamed zombie horse can also be summoned using /summon minecraft:zombie_horse ~ ~ ~ {Tame:1b}.

## Statistics
Zombie horses are spawned with constant health of 15, speed of 0.2, and have a jump strength ranging from 0.4–1.0, tending toward the average 0.7.
