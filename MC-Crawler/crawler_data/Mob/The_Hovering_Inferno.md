## Appearance
Wildfire statue
Wildfires are large mobs, similar to blazes in appearance. They possess four floating shields around them, a blaze rod like pillar underneath their head, and a helmet fitted with a small red gem. The four shields of wildfires happen to have their own model entity that is separate from wildfires.[verify] A wildfire is depicted as the central structure within the nether fortress.

## Behavior
Wildfires are shielded mobs similar to royal guards, vanguards, and tower guards, where the mob's shield must be destroyed first. However, unlike most shielded mobs, wildfires have four shields protecting them, all of which must be destroyed before the hero can inflict damage, and the shields can also take multiple hits before breaking. When wildfires are low on health, they will retreat and heal itself within fire like blazes, but can also regenerate damaged and destroyed shields.

Basic attack
Wildfires will occasionally shoot a barrage of shield debris instead of fireballs at a hero.

Shockwave attack
Wildfires will slam the ground if a target gets too close, sending out a small shockwave, knocking back both heroes and mobs.

Summon
Wildfires are also capable of summoning one or two blazes to assist it.
