# Java Edition 22w13oneBlockAtATime
22w13oneBlockAtATime (known as 22w13oneblockatatime in the launcher) is an April Fools' joke snapshot, supposedly the first and only snapshot for the "One Block at a Time Update", released on April 1, 2022,[1] which overhauled the player's inventory as well as the game logic for blocks, items and entities, and redesigned relevant gameplay aspects such as controlling, breaking and crafting. This version is a fork of a commit between 1.18.2 and 22w11a, as it contains several blocks (not complete) from the deep dark biome.
