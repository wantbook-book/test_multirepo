## Experimental Additions
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Update 1.21" and "Beta APIs" experimental toggles.

### Blocks
 Crafter
- A newblockthat enables thecraftingofitemsand blocks viaredstone.


- The crafter ejects one crafted item at a time when powered by a new redstone pulse. Upon receiving this new pulse, the crafter ejects the result from the front face.
- All the result items will be ejected together when the output result has multiple type of items.
- Crafters can be oriented in any direction when placed.
- They have a unique user interface:
	- They have a 3×3 interactable crafting grid.
	- Their crafting grid slots are toggleable, meaning that the player can change the behavior of a slot by clicking or pressing on a slot with an empty hand.
	- A "toggled" slot cannot hold any items and therefore cannot have items placed into it by other blocks such ashoppersanddroppers.
	- Unlike thecrafting table, the slots display a preview of the crafted item which will be crafted and ejected on the next redstone pulse but cannot be manually taken out by the player.
	- The user interface is shared between all players interacting with them, meaning that multiple players can interact with them at the same time, similar tochestsand hoppers.
- They interact with other blocks in the following ways:
	- When read by aredstone comparator, the redstone signal strength is 0 to 9, where each non-empty or toggled slot adds 1 strength.
	- Hoppers can be used to both insert and pull items out of them.
	- Droppers can be used to insert items into them.
	- Moving items in from another block with ahopperor adropperprioritizes filling items into slots following these rules:
		- Crafters prioritize the first empty slot from left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
		- If there are no empty slots then crafters prioritize the smallest stack of the same item and pick the first if there are multiple.
		- If there is a toggled slot, it is skipped. The item will then be moved into thecontainer.
		- If the item cannot be moved, it is ejected into theworld.

 Heavy core
- A mysterious, dense block which can be combined with abreeze rodto craft amace.
- The heavy core block has a 8.3% chance of being rewarded when using aominous trial keyon aominous vaultin thetrial chambers.

 Ominous trial spawner
- A more powerful active phase of the trial spawner with unique challenges and rewards.
	- Provides a more challenging experience that advanced players can opt into for better rewards.
- If a trial spawner detects a player that has the Trial Omen effect, the spawner will become ominous if:
	- It is not in cooldown.
	- Or, it is in cooldown but was not ominous during its last activation.
		- Making it ominous this way will bypass the cooldown.
- While active, it will:
	- Glow blue instead of orange.
	- Emit soul flames instead of normal flames.
	- Very commonly spawns mobs with equipment if they can wear it.
		- The equipment these mobs wear have armor trims applied from the trial chambers.
		- Known issue: these mobs can currently drop their equipment on death, but they will not in the future.
	- Periodically spawn potions and projectiles on top of unsuspecting players and mobs.
		- Based on their location, spawners in an area will select a random set of projectiles to spawn.
		- These projectiles will always include a single type of lingering potion from a set of possible effects.
- Becoming ominous will despawn any existing mobs it spawned and reset its challenge.
	- It will stay ominous until it has been defeated and its cooldown has finished.
- When defeated, it will eject a different set of loot to normal trial spawners.

In Java Edition 1.21, each trial chambers trial spawner ominous contains 1 item stack,  with the following distribution:

↑ The size of stacks (or for unstackable items, number) of this item on any given roll.

↑ The weight of this item relative to other items in the pool.

↑ The odds of finding any of this item in a single chest.

↑ The number of items expected per chest, averaged over a large number of chests.

↑ The average number of chests the player should expect to search to find any of this item.



- Ominous trial keys have a 30% chance of ejecting from a defeated ominous trial spawner, replacing the usual 50% chance to eject trial keys.

 Ominous vault
- A variant of vaults that have a different texture and emit soul flames instead of normal flames.
- These can be found throughout thetrial chambersin harder to find places and require an ominous trial key to unlock.
- These vaults hold a more valuable set of rewards than the standard vaults unlocked by trial keys.
- Ominous vaults can provide some particularly valuable items.

In Java Edition 1.21, each trial chambers ominous vault contains  items drawn from 3 pools,  with the following distribution:

 Trial spawner
- Generates intrial chambers.
- The trial spawner is a new form ofspawnerthat ejects rewards upon completion and can have variable levels of challenge inmultiplayer.
- The challenge level will increase for each new player a trial spawner notices nearby.
	- Challenge level will not decrease until it is reset during a trial spawner's cooldown.
- Unlikemonster spawners, a trial spawner will spawn a limited number of mobs proportional to its current challenge level.
	- It can only spawn a mob at positions that are within line of sight.
	- It can spawn a mob regardless of any light level requirement the mob.
	- Spawned mobs are persistent.
- Once all mobs are defeated, the trial spawner will eject a set of rewards proportional to the current challenge level.
	- After the rewards have been ejected, the trial spawner goes into cooldown for 30 minutes during which it will no longer spawn mobs.

In Java Edition, each trial spawner contains 1 item stack,  with the following distribution:

- Trial spawners cannot be crafted nor obtained by players inSurvival- instead, they can be found naturally placed throughouttrial chambers.
- Trial spawners are extremely slow to mine and resistant to explosions, and will not drop even withSilk Touch.
- When placed inCreative, trial spawners have no mob type set by default.
	- The mob type can be set by interacting with it while holding aspawn egg.
- Players in Creative orSpectatormode are not detected or noticed by trial spawners.

 Vault
- Can be found in thetrial chambers.
- Can be unlocked with atrial key.
- Eachplayercan open the vault only once to get a reward.

In Java Edition and Bedrock Edition, each trial chambers reward container contains  items drawn from 3 pools,  with the following distribution:

		- Like any other effect, players can drink a bucket of milk to clear the Raid Omen to prevent the raid from starting.
	- It is no longer given to players that defeat a raid captain outside a raid.
		- Instead, players can gain access to Bad Omen by consuming a new ominous bottle.
