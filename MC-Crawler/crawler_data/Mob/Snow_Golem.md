# Snow Golem
A snow golem is a buildable passive mob that throws snowballs at monsters, which provokes them into attacking it. Depending on the biome temperature it also either produces a trail of snow, or takes heat damage and dies.

## Creation
See also: Tutorials/Snow golems














Snow golem build configuration.Jack o'lanterns can also be used.


Snow golems search for the nearest monster and attack it.
Snow golems are created by placing 2 snow blocks in an I shape (as shown in the image), and then placing a pumpkin‌[Bedrock Edition  only], a carved pumpkin, or a jack o'lantern on top. The pumpkin may be placed by the player, a dispenser, or an enderman.[1] The building pattern also works when arranged sideways or upside-down, as long as the pumpkin is the last block placed. The player can place the snow blocks in any pattern and then place an uncarved pumpkin.‌[Java Edition  only]

The snow golem spawns at the location of the snow block as its feet when created horizontally.


## Drops

| Item |          | Roll Chance | Quantity (Roll Chance) |           |            |             |

## Behavior
See also: Tutorials/Snow farming

A snow golem wanders aimlessly and tries to avoid water, obstacles and environmental hazards, but is immune to damage from powder snow.

A snow golem after shearing the carved pumpkin from its head.
A snow golem wears its carved pumpkin like a helmet. Its actual head is hidden beneath the pumpkin. Shearing a snow golem removes the pumpkin, revealing its face and making it drop the pumpkin. The pumpkin is stored using the Pumpkin tag instead of ArmorItems; a snow golem does not display its HandItems or its ArmorItems. After shearing the pumpkin, the player can give a snow golem a new pumpkin only by using a command, such as /data‌[Java Edition  only].

As a snow golem moves, it leaves a trail of snow on the ground if the blocks can support it[2] in any biome regardless of the temperature, unless it is in a mushroom field biome, in which it does not spread snow.‌[Bedrock Edition  only] If the mobGriefing game rule is false, a snow trail does not appear. A snow golem does'nt take any fall damage

Snow golems are damaged in contact with rain or water and in biomes with a temperature greater than 1.0. Examples include savannas, badlands, deserts or biomes in the Nether. The Fire Resistance effect allows them to survive in these biomes.‌[Java Edition  only][3]

A group of snow golems throwing snowballs at a spider.
Snow golems move toward all monsters (except ghasts) and throw snowballs at them up to 10 blocks away, provoking them, regardless of whether they attack the player.[4] When captured, they throw snowballs up to 16 blocks away. They throw one snowball per second. Thrown snowballs do not deal damage except to blazes and wolves,[5] but the snowballs knock back any mobs that they hit.

Additionally, snow golems also attack creepers and never intentionally attack the player, in Bedrock Edition, if a snowball hits the player, it deals knockback and makes tamed wolves & trusting foxes attack them. 

The snow golem's snowballs can set other mobs on fire in addition to knockback, if the shot flies through a lava block or a block that is on fire.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

A snow golem is not provoked by another golem (snow or iron) attacking it, although an iron golem that is hit accidentally by a snow golem's snowball attacks the snow golem.
