# Penguin
The penguin was a proposed mob featured in the Mob Vote during Minecraft Live 2023, alongside the crab and armadillo, having been the first mob to be voted out. It would have spawned in stony shores, and would have been amphibious, living both in the water and on land. Although they were clumsy when walking and fell down occasionally, the penguins were excellent swimmers and could swim as fast as the dolphins. They gathered in groups.[1][2]
