## Spawning
On Normal difficulty and Hard difficulty, vindicators sometimes spawn with a randomly enchanted iron axe: the chance is 0–25%, and is higher when the regional difficulty is higher.

### Woodland mansions
Vindicators spawn during the generation of woodland mansions, in groups of 1–3 inside particular rooms, sometimes accompanied by an evoker. Rarely, vindicators can spawn in the corridors and hallways. 

They do not respawn after initially spawning. Vindicators generated in mansions do not naturally despawn unless the world is switched to peaceful difficulty.

Vindicators are sometimes neutral if naturally spawned in a woodland mansion, which means that the vindicator does not attack the player on sight, but only after the player attacks it.

### Patrols
Main article: Patrol
In Java Edition, any vindicators can join a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain, but do not go seeking out for patrols to join.

### Raids
Main article: Raid
Vindicators can spawn during raids. They appear more frequently during later waves and at higher difficulties.

Vindicators can spawn riding ravagers, creating a vindicator ravager jockey.‌[JE  only]

### Java Edition
In Java Edition, if a player spawns a vindicator with a spawn egg or using a command, the vindicator has a chance of becoming an illager captain, with a Ominous banner attached above its back.

## Drops
### On death
| Item |                | Roll Chance | Quantity (Roll Chance) |           |            |             |

↑ Dropped only when kill credit is given to the player

A vindicator drops loot only when killed by a player or tamed wolf:

- 5 and an additional1–3 per naturally-spawned equipment.
- 8.5% chance ofdropping theirnormal orenchantediron axe, which increases by 1% per level of Looting with random durability.

#### Bedrock Edition
In Bedrock Edition, if a vindicator spawns as part of a raid, it drops:

- 0-1Emerald

Additionally, in Bedrock Edition, vindicators have a 65% chance of dropping the following on Easy and Normal difficulties, and an 80% chance of dropping them on Hard difficulty:

- 0-1Emerald(10⁄39chance)
- 2-3Emerald(5⁄39chance)
- 4-5Emerald(2⁄39chance)
- 1Enchanted Book(2⁄39chance)
- 1Iron Axe(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Pickaxe(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Shovel(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Sword(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Helmet(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Chestplate(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Leggings(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Boots(5⁄78chance)

Notes:

- Iron equipment from raid drops always has a 50% chance of being enchanted with a random enchantment at level 5-19.
- Iron equipment from raid drops is always damaged.
- These drops are also affected by theLootingenchantment.
- The enchanted book has a level 30 enchantment, may be treasure enchantment.
- Emeralds are both a regular raid drop and an additional raid drop.
- With Looting III enchantment, a vindicator has spawned from a raid can drop up to 16 emeralds upon death, but the chance is 3.328% on Easy or Normal, and 4.096% on Hard.
- It is possible for a vindicator spawned from a raid to drop both its naturally-spawned iron axe and a second iron axe from its additional raid drops (in Easy and Normal difficulty 0.3536% chance, 0.3952% chance with Looting I, 0.4368% chance with Looting II, and 0.4784% chance with Looting III, while in Hard difficulty 0.4352% chance, 0.4864% chance with Looting I, 0.5376% chance with Looting II, and 0.5888% chance with Looting III).

## Behavior
A vindicator captain chasing a Villager.
Vindicators are hostile toward players, iron golems, adult villagers, wandering traders, and snow golems.‌[BE  only]

While idle, a vindicator crosses its arms similar to a villager, with its axe stowed. While giving chase, the vindicator brandishes its axe and sprints. If it has no weapons, a mainhand-unarmed vindicator raises both of its hands when attacking.

On Normal and Hard difficulties, vindicators that are part of a raid can break wooden doors. This is controlled by the raider tag.[1] Like any illager during a raid, vindicators celebrate by cheering if all the villagers are killed or all the beds are destroyed.

In Bedrock Edition, if a pillager arrow accidentally strikes a vindicator, the vindicator retaliates against the pillager, but the pillager does not retaliate. All illagers remain friendly to each other in Java Edition, even when struck accidentally.[2]

### Java Edition
Vindicators are likely to call help from other vindicators when attacked by mobs (except for illagers and goats, or if they were killed in one hit), inciting them all to attack the aggressor. They do not call help from other kinds of illagers.

Vindicator raiders, in addition to breaking doors, can also open doors like villagers.

Ringing a bell gives all vindicators within 32 blocks the Glowing effect for 3 seconds.

### Bedrock Edition
Vindicators can only sprint, even when idle.

A dispenser can equip a vindicator with armor, but it is invisible and does not show on its model.

### Damage
Armed vindicators hit for 7.5 × 3.75 to 19.5 × 9.75 damage, depending on difficulty. They tie with piglin brutes for dealing the forth most melee damage in the game, following the iron golem at 21 × 10.5 damage, the warden at 45 × 22.5 damage and the giant at 75 × 37.5 damage. 

The vindicator's axe attack disables the player's shield for 5 seconds, even when riding a ravager.

### 
A vindicator named Johnny (using a name tag, named spawn egg, etc., or has its Johnny tag set to 1b) is hostile to armor stands‌[BE  only][3], cameras, players in Adventure or Survival mode and all mobs except agents, evokers, ghasts[4], illusioners‌[JE  only], other vindicators, and pillagers. This includes baby villagers‌[BE  only][5], creepers, ravagers‌[JE  only][6], vexes[7], and witches.[8] Vexes or witches do not attack "Johnny" vindicators unless provoked by vindicators.

"Johnny" vindicators also attempt to attack the ender dragon, but she does not take damage.

Most hostile or neutral mobs try to attack the "Johnny" vindicator in return. Exceptions are: 

- mobs that die in one hit (e.g.bees,endermites);
- ender dragonsandphantoms, as those only attack players (however ender dragon deals damage to all mobs that touch it, but that's not considered an attack);
- goats(apart from their usual ramming behavior);
- slimes,magma cubes,ravagers,guardiansandelder guardians.

The Johnny tag overrides its name; the player can give the vindicator any other name and set the Johnny tag to 1b and it remains hostile in the same way as described. Conversely, the player can name the vindicator "Johnny" and set the Johnny tag to 0b, causing the vindicator to act as a normal vindicator.

In Java Edition, using a name tag to rename a "Johnny" vindicator does not reset its Johnny tag, and it continues to exhibit "Johnny" behavior.

In Bedrock Edition, naming a vindicator spawn egg "Johnny" and using it on a monster spawner has no effect; normal vindicators spawn rather than vindicators named "Johnny".
