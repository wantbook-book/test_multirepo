## Spawning
### Natural generation
Zombies may spawn in the Overworld in groups of four, above solid blocks in a light level of 0, except in mushroom fields and deep dark biomes. All zombie variants (including babies) require a 2-block tall space to spawn.

All zombies spawned in desert biomes and exposed to the sky have a likelihood of 80%‌[JE  only]/70%‌[BE  only] to be replaced by husks. Zombies that are not husks or drowned have a 5% chance to spawn as zombie villagers. Zombie variants have a 5% chance to spawn as babies. The baby zombies also have a chance of spawning as a chicken jockey in Java Edition.

When a zombie spawn egg is used on a zombie, it spawns a baby zombie.

### Sieges

  

This feature is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


Main article: Zombie siege
If a player is near a village at midnight, up to 20 zombies may be spawned in the village in accordance with mob spawning rules. The spawning can even happen in mushroom fields biome if the triggering player is in an adjacent biome. Zombies spawned as a part of a siege are always regular zombies; zombie villagers, husks and drowned never spawn as a part of a siege, even in their respective biomes.

### Monster spawners
Inside monster rooms, zombies may have a chance to spawn from a monster spawner. Zombies spawned from a monster spawner are never zombie villagers in Java Edition, although zombie monster spawners in Bedrock Edition are able to produce them. Zombies spawn from monster spawners inside 50% of monster rooms.

### Trial spawners
‌In Java Edition 1.21 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.0‌[upcoming], adult zombies have a chance to be selected as the "melee" mob for trial spawners in trial chambers; baby zombies have a chance to be selected as the "small melee" mob for trial spawners.

### Husks
When a husk's head is submerged in water for over 30 seconds, the husk starts transforming into a zombie, with a new entity UUID. The husk's equipment remains on the zombie after conversion.‌[JE  only] The zombie transforms into a drowned if its head remains submerged.

## Variants
### Baby zombies
For the mob in Minecraft Dungeons, see Minecraft Dungeons:Baby Zombie.

Baby zombie riding a chicken.
#### Behavior
Baby zombies make up 5% of zombie spawns. They behave similarly to regular zombies, with the following differences:

- They are much faster than normal zombies, yet they have the samehealth.
- The noises they make are higher-pitched than adult zombiesoundeffects.
- Babyzombie villagersturn into baby villagers if cured.
- Wornarmorshrinks to fit their body size.
- They are able to fit through 1×1blockgaps.
- They give 12experiencepoints when killed by the player or a tamed wolf instead of 5.
- Unlike most other baby mobs, they remain babies indefinitely and never become adult zombies.
- They have a decreased hitbox size.

In Bedrock Edition, 15% of naturally spawned baby zombies can start riding a mob and become a jockey when it tries attacking. The jockey mobs ridden by the baby zombie adapt the speed of its rider. In Bedrock Edition, a baby zombie can ride:


 Adult chickens
 Untamed ocelots
 Untamed cats
 Untamed wolves
 Adult zombies
 Adult husks
 Adult zombie villagers
 Adult zombified piglins
Cows
 Adult unsaddled pigs
Sheep
 Untamed adult horses
 Untamed adult donkeys
 Untamed adult mules
 Adult skeleton horses
 Adult zombie horses
Mooshrooms
 Spiders that were not spawned as a jockey mount
 Cave spiders that were not spawned as a jockey mount
Pandas
Zombies and their variants spawn with random values of knockback resistance between 0% and 5%.

### Zombie villagers
Main article: Zombie Villager
Zombie villagers have a 5% chance of spawning in place of zombies and may also spawn from a villager killed by a zombie. The chance of a villager turning into a zombie villager when killed by a zombie or zombie variant depends on the difficulty level.

When a group in the normal spawn cycle spawns zombies, there is a 5% chance to instead spawn a group of zombie villagers‌[Bedrock Edition  only], or a single zombie villager.‌[Java Edition  only]

If any type of zombie kills a villager, there is a chance for the villager to transform into a zombie villager.

| Difficulty | Chance |
|------------|--------|
| Easy       | 0%     |
| Normal     | 50%    |
| Hard       | 100%   |

Any villagers that get killed by a zombie have a chance to turn into a zombie villager with armor on normal or hard difficulties.

Zombie villagers can be cured (converted to normal villagers) by first giving them the Weakness effect, which can be applied by:

- Asplash potionofWeaknessthrown by theplayer, adispenser, or awitch.
- An area effect cloud of Weakness from alingering potion.
- An area effect cloud of Weakness from acreeperexplosion.‌‌[Java Edition  only]
- Atipped arrowthat was dipped into a Weakness potion.

The weakened zombie villager must then be healed by using a (non-enchanted) golden apple on them.

### Husks
Main article: Husk
Husks have an 80% chance to spawn in desert biomes in place of zombies. They attack like regular zombies, but inflict hunger for several seconds and do not burn in sunlight.

### Drowned
Main article: Drowned
Drowned mobs spawn in ocean ruins, rivers, most parts of oceans or when a normal zombie drowns. They are able to swim and breathe underwater as well as walk on land. Most drowned use melee attacks, but some spawn with tridents and throw them when attacking instead.

Zombies that are wearing armor and go underwater continue wearing the armor when converted to a drowned, although tools and weapons are lost.‌[JE  only]

Zombies that convert to drowned drop all worn or held equipment with full durability and preserving existing enchantments.‌[BE  only]

### Geared zombies
Some zombies spawn wearing armor or holding tools, both of which may be enchanted. In addition, zombies may also spawn with the ability to pick up loot that is on the ground. The chances of each of these events occurring are listed below. Zombie villagers can also spawn naturally with armor, weapons or tools. If a zombie spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (i.e. all pieces are made of the same material). Zombies cannot naturally spawn with netherite armor.

|                            | Easy | Normal         | Hard               |

↑ 1⁄3 chance of an iron sword, 2⁄3 chance of an iron shovel


If a zombie does spawn with armor, the chances of specific armor are as follows:

Java Edition:

| Armor                           | Easy & Normal | Hard  |
|---------------------------------|---------------|-------|
| Boots                           | 100%          | 100%  |
| Boots and leggings              | 75%           | 90%   |
| Boots, leggings, and chestplate | 56.25%        | 81%   |
| Full set                        | 42.19%        | 72.9% |

Bedrock Edition:

| Armor                            | Easy & Normal | Hard  |
|----------------------------------|---------------|-------|
| Helmet                           | 100%          | 100%  |
| Helmet and chestplate            | 75%           | 90%   |
| Helmet, chestplate, and leggings | 56.25%        | 81%   |
| Full set                         | 42.19%        | 72.9% |

The chances of it being of a particular material are:

| Armor Type | Chance |
|------------|--------|
| Leather    | 37.06% |
| Gold       | 48.73% |
| Chain      | 12.90% |
| Iron       | 1.27%  |
| Diamond    | 0.04%  |

Armor worn by zombies is not damaged from most damage sources, which means it cannot "wear out" the way player armor does. Helmets (not blocks like pumpkins) on zombies can eventually wear away and break if the zombie is exposed to daylight or has an anvil or other falling block dropped on its head. Zombies also have a natural armor rating of 2 (), giving 1.6 to 8% damage reduction from most sources. Zombies can also wear mob heads, although they need to be dropped by the player before the zombie can pick one up and put it on.

On Halloween, zombies in Java Edition may spawn wearing a carved pumpkin or jack o'lantern. They are never dropped, even when the zombies are killed with Looting.

## Drops
### On death

↑ Only dropped when killed by a charged creeper.


#### Rare drops
Zombies may also drop one of the following when killed by a player or tamed wolf:

| Item |             | Roll Chance      | Quantity (Roll Chance) |           |            |             |

|      | Potato[d 2] | 0.83%–1.82%[d 1] | 1 (0.83%)              | 1 (1.16%) | 1 (1.49%)  | 1 (1.82%)   |


↑ a b c Dropped only when kill credit is given to the player

↑ Dropped as baked potato if on fire when killed.


#### Taken equipment
Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping and drops without changing the damage that has accumulated on it.

#### Naturally-spawned equipment
Zombies have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment and drop it with a random durability. Each level of Looting increases the chance by 1 percentage point (11.5% with Looting III). These items include:

- Iron Shovel(sometimesenchanted)
- Iron Sword(sometimesenchanted)
- Random Armor(sometimesenchanted, made from leather, gold, chainmail, iron or diamond)

#### Experience
Any zombie that spawns with equipment gives 1–3 extra experience points per item when killed. Adult zombies drop 5 and baby zombies drop 12 when they are killed by a player or a tamed wolf.

## Behavior
### Attacking the player
Zombies pursue the player on sight from 35 blocks away in Java Edition or 16 blocks away in Bedrock Edition, raising their arms up.‌[JE  only] The detection range of zombies is reduced to half of their normal range (17.5 blocks) when the player is wearing a zombie head. If a zombie sees a player and a villager together, the zombie prefers to attack the player first. In Java Edition, zombies will keep chasing the player and will ignore other villagers. In Bedrock Edition, zombies prioritize the nearest player, villager, or golem.

Zombies periodically make groaning sounds, which can be heard up to 16 blocks away. Zombies attempt to avoid obstacles, including fall damage, fire, lava, magma blocks, and cactus and try to find the shortest path toward the player.[1] Unlike skeletons, zombies do not try to avoid being hit and continue to pursue the player even when being attacked.

### Attacking turtles
Zombies attack baby turtles and actively seek out and destroy turtle eggs within 24 blocks horizontally and 3 blocks vertically, by jumping on them until they crack and break.

### Attacking golems
Zombies pursue and attack only iron golems within 42 blocks; zombies ignore snow golems unless attacked. Iron golems and snow golems attack zombies without provocation, although snow golems deal only knockback to zombies with their snowballs.

### Attacking villagers
Zombies target villagers within a 35– to 52.5–block radius (depending on regional difficulty)‌[Java Edition  only] or a 16-block radius‌[Bedrock Edition  only] and they can always see villagers through walls. If a zombie is attacking a villager and sees the player, it interrupts its attack on the villager to attack the player instead, even if the player has not attacked it‌[JE  only]. Once a zombie has targeted a villager, the zombie ignores any other villagers and the player, until its target is dead or the zombie is attacked‌[JE  only].

Any zombie variant can transform a villager into a zombie villager. The probability depends on the difficulty:

- 0% chance inPeaceful(no zombies spawn) andEasy
- 50% chance inNormal
- 100% chance inHard

### Attacking wandering traders
Zombies target wandering traders within 35 blocks and can see traders through walls. The zombie focuses solely on the trader unless it's attacked, or if either it or the target is killed or moved out of range, or if the trader is under the invisibility status effect.

A zombie breaking down a wooden oak door. The zombie can break only the top half of the door, not the bottom half.
### Burning under daylight
When the sun is 15 degrees or more above the ground, zombies burn once exposed to direct sunlight. Burning is suppressed when the zombie is:

- in a sufficiently shaded area: asunlight levelof 11 or less (a 1 block roof overhang provides sufficient protection even if it would have a sunlight level of 14);
- in water;
- wearing headarmor(the helmet absorbs the damage from light but may take several day cycles to wear out completely).
- under the status effect ofFire Resistance.
- standing in cobwebs.[2]

Transparent and translucent blocks, including glass and ice, do not prevent them from burning.‌[JE  only].

If they attack an entity while burning, they may set it on fire, with a (30×regional difficulty)% chance and with a 2×floor (regional difficulty) second duration‌‌[JE  only]. If wearing armor enchanted with Thorns while burning, they may set players attacking them on fire with thorns damage alone.

### Undead
Being an undead mob, they are: 

- damaged by the status effectInstant Healthand healed by the status effectInstant Damage.
- unaffected by the status effectsRegenerationandPoison.
- ignored by thewither.
- affected by theSmiteenchantment.
- a threat toarmadillos, causing them to hide in their shell.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80]

### Picking up items
Some zombies are capable of automatically picking up dropped items that they come across. Mob heads and carved pumpkins are automatically worn on their heads. Zombies can equip armor, weapons or tools. If a zombie encounters another similar item, it may drop the previous item in favor of the new one, if:

- the new item is armor or a sword and the old item was not (for example, zombies preferswordstopickaxes, andhelmetstocarved pumpkins),
- both items are armor/swords and the new item is better damage-wise (reduces higher damage for armor, or inflicts more damage for swords),
- both items are armor/swords with the same damage reduction/infliction, the new item has NBT tags while the old does not or the new item ismoredamagedthan the old item, or
- both items arebowsand the new item has NBT tags while the old does not.

For example, a zombie can pick up a totem of undying, which cannot be retrieved by killing the zombie because that would activate the totem. However, the zombie would drop the totem in favor of a sword or armor.

Items dropped by mobs in exchange for another cannot be picked up by players or mobs for 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag), but can be picked up by hoppers.

A zombie holding a picked-up item does not despawn when left alone, similar to being name tagged.

Zombies have a higher chance of being able to pick up items in Hard difficulty.

Picked-up items do not cause the zombie to drop more experience when killed, unlike naturally-spawned gear.

### Breaking doors
Up to 10% of zombies (depending on regional difficulty) in pursuit of a target bang on closed wooden doors and on Hard (and Hardcore) difficulty can succeed in breaking them down. Otherwise, the door cracks but does not break.

A zombie choosing to break the door down instead of taking an alternative path.
The zombie also breaks down the door if the door is blocking its way. Zombies can break only the top half of a door, meaning they cannot break a door if the zombie is facing the bottom half of the door.

### Reinforcements

  

This feature is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


On all difficulty levels, damaged zombie mobs (including husks, drowned and even zombified piglins[3]) call all other zombies within a 67×21×67 to 111×21×111 area[n 1] centered on the attacked zombie to target the attacker.

In Hard difficulty, zombies can spawn additional zombies to "help" when damaged. Each zombie has a "likeliness to call reinforcements" statistic ranging from 0–10%, and "leader" zombies (0–5% depending on regional difficulty) get a bonus of 50–75 percentage points to the stat. When the zombie is damaged by an entity or is damaged while targeting an entity, up to 50 attempts are made to randomly choose a spawn location (0 or ±7–40 blocks away in all three axes) that is above a block with a solid top surface, has light level 0, has no players within 7 blocks, and has no colliding entities or blocks at which to spawn the reinforcement. Both the damaged zombie and the new zombie has a 5 percentage point penalty to their "likeliness to call reinforcement" stat, preventing infinite zombies from spawning this way.  Zombie reinforcements can spawn even in locations where naturally spawned zombies can't spawn, like mushroom fields, the End, and the Nether[4], although they still cannot spawn on blocks where other items like redstone dust or pressure plates are placed.

These effects can be negated by killing the zombie in as few hits as possible, by using environmental damage such as cactus or lava, or by avoiding them completely. That is, if the zombified mob drops experience, it has a chance to spawn reinforcements. Additionally, reinforcements do not spawn at all, even on Hard difficulty, if the game rule doMobSpawning is set to false.

Leader zombies are a special type of zombie that spawn with an added 50-75% chance to spawn reinforcements. The chance of a leader zombie spawning increases with clamped regional difficulty, up to a 5% chance of spawning.

Reinforcements zombies spawn regardless of the hostile mob cap. They also spawn on the north-west corner of the designated block, instead of the center of the block like natural mob spawning does.[5] Zombies spawned as reinforcements cannot be zombie villagers, but they can be babies, including chicken jockeys.

### Becoming drowned
A husk that suffocates in water converts to a zombie.
A zombie that suffocates in water converts into a drowned.
If a zombie's head is submerged in water for 30 seconds, it begins converting into a drowned. The zombie shakes, similar to a zombie villager being cured and, after 15 seconds, the zombie becomes drowned. Once this process starts, it cannot be stopped even if the zombie leaves water. This time is not affected by the Respiration enchantment or the Water Breathing status effect. 

A newly-converted drowned always has full health even if converted from a damaged zombie.

An item being held or worn by a zombie when it becomes drowned, whether it was picked up or naturally spawned, has a 100% drop rate, which includes any naturally spawned equipment dropping with full durability‌[BE  only].

Only normal zombies can become drowned; zombie villagers and zombified piglins cannot be converted.[6] Husks, however, convert into zombies if they drown, and then this zombie converts into a drowned as does a normal zombie.

Any husks that convert into zombies also have full health, even if the drowned husk is damaged.
