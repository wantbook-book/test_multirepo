## Obtaining
### Mob loot
When killed by any skeleton or stray (or wither skeleton if given a bow using commands), a creeper drops a random music disc from the following pool:

- 13
- cat
- blocks
- chirp
- far
- mall
- mellohi
- stal
- strad
- ward
- 11
- wait

Because TNT ignited by a flaming arrow attributes all resulting kills to the entity that fired the arrow, a skeleton igniting a TNT block due to holding a bow enchanted with Flame, or shooting through lava or fire, also causes any creepers killed in the explosion to drop a disc.[1][2]

|      | 13           | C418         | A somewhat unsettling, cave-themed ambient piece consisting mostly of echoed synthesized ambient sounds that closely resemble those that play in the game's caves, resonating metallic clinks, and quiet wind blowing. The entire track is wholly engulfed in reverb. At different points in the piece, muffled bow firings, a heavily reverbed hiss followed by a subsequent heavily reverbed explosion and echoed splashes can be heard in the background. The track goes silent for 13 seconds at the 1:30 mark.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | "Thirteen"           | Minecraft - Volume AlphaNo. 16                            |               | 2:58                 |
|      | cat          | C418         | A light, looping melody plays on a soft synth and is joined by a synth percussion beat. A toothlike synth plays a bass line and some harmonies throughout and is later accompanied by additional chiptune-like synths that provide more layers of harmony.At 1:46, what sounds like an interpolation of part of the melody from the track "Minecraft" plays.The four-note pattern at 2:04 can also be heard at the beginning of "far" and "dog".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | "Cat"                | Minecraft - Volume AlphaNo. 19                            |               | 3:05                 |

|      | 11           | C418         | A recording that begins with vinyl static, followed by the sounds of someone walking on or breakingstoneblocks, heavy breathing, and rustling. Haunting background noises are heard throughout the recording, resembling the ambient sound effects that play in the game's caves (and by extension, the sounds of the disc "13"). After the background noises quiet down for a moment, metallic clicking or scraping noises can be heard, followed by coughing, sounds of page-turning, then more clicking or scraping. The background noises resume more loudly, and the sounds of faster footsteps or breakingstoneblocks can be heard, which accelerate until they are replaced withdirtsounds as the background noises approach. A loud, distorted noise is heard roughly a second before the recording abruptly stops. At this point, one hears only quiet beeping, vinyl static, and a hissing noise, and the track ends.                                                                                    | "Eleven"             | Minecraft - Volume BetaNo. 25                             |               | 1:11                 |

It starts out with some quiet synth Latin percussion and some soft synths playing a melody, and then expands into a chiptune-esque song. This disc was originally named "where are we now".[5][6]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | "Wait"               | Minecraft - Volume BetaNo. 21                             |               | 3:58 (Fades at 3:51) |

Upon reaching the second half, the song changes to a minor key and progresses into a darker melody, eventually cutting off abruptly.

The walking becomes heavier and metallic. The sound stops with sounds of breathing followed by a roar which warps into soft, relaxing music. The music soon transitions back, to the sound of footsteps,lavabubbling, andamethyst. A warped noise and asculk shriekercan be heard activating. Then a coughing sound, something metallic and stone and sand sounds followed by another warped noise can be heard. Then, after a moment of silence, a heartbeat begins and a rising static can be heard in the background. Sounds ofdeepslatecan then be heard, along with strange noises building up and abruptly stopping. A crescendo of overlapping warped sounds is followed then dies down. The footsteps begin again, much quieter now. Asculk sensorclicks, and awardenroars.

|      | Relic        | Aaron Cherof | The recording begins with vinyl static and record grain before abruptly bursting out into an upbeat 8-bit tune of low audio quality. The main melody of "A Time of Legends" and "The Well of Fate" from theoriginal soundtrackofMinecraft Legendsis heard later, played on the same 8-bit synthesizer. Later in the song a bass is added to the noise. Slight record grain and warbled pitches can be heard throughout the song.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | "Relic"              | Minecraft: Trails & Tales (Original Game Soundtrack)No. 5 |               | 3:38                 |

## Usage
The music discs resemble older 78-rpm phonograph records from the early 20th century, which were often played in jukeboxes from that era. They are used in Minecraft in a similar fashion: A music disc can be played on a jukebox by holding the disc and right-clicking on the jukebox.

The in-game music disc tracks are all monaural recordings. Tracks released for listening outside of the game are in stereo (though Pigstep has a mono version included in the Nether Update soundtrack EP).

If the player places a comparator besides a jukebox, the intensity of the redstone signal depends on the disc currently played, with the following values:

| Disc                | Intensity |
|---------------------|-----------|
| (no disc)           | 0         |
