## Usage
Poisonous potato chestplate can be equipped in the 2nd armor slot like any other chestplate. It doesn't provide any protection, but instead replenished player's hunger bar.

If player loses a hunger point while chestplate is equipped, it gets added back immediately, and chestplate loses 40 points of durability. Because it has 240 points in total, it can replenish 6 hunger points. Note that chestplate fills up the hunger bar only to the level that player had when chestplate was equipped.

Poisonous potato chestplate doesn't inflict player with Poison, despite being made from poisonous potatoes.

### Peeling
If player has the chestplate equipped, another player can peel it using the potato peeler on them. Chestplate disappears, and a number of potato peels are scattered around the player that was wearing it.
