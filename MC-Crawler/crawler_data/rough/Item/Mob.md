# Mob
A mob (short for mobile, mobile entity, or mobile object)[1] is an AI-driven game entity. All mobs can be attacked and hurt (from falling, attacked by a player or another mob, falling into the void, hit by an arrow, etc), and have some form of voluntary movement. Different types of mobs often have unique AI and loot.

## Spawning
Main article: Spawn cycle
Different mobs spawn in diverse habitats, depending on the light level, biome, and surface material.

Mobs spawn in various ways. Most mobs spawn naturally, depending on the light level, biome, and their surroundings. For example, most animals are found in bright areas on the surface, while hostile monsters are commonly found in the dark (whether it's a cave, dungeon, mansion, or at night). Animals usually spawn upon chunk generation, while hostile monsters spawn and despawn in a certain radius around the player. Some mobs, including passive and neutral animals, and even hoglins have the ability to be bred by the player, creating offspring. Villagers also breed randomly depending on the time of day and the number of beds (though they can’t be directly bred by the player). Most mobs never spawn on transparent blocks, in water (except fish, dolphins, turtles, and other aquatic creatures), in lava (except for striders), on bedrock, or on blocks less than a full block tall (such as slabs placed on the bottom half). The exception is monster spawners, from which monsters can spawn naturally on any block including air. A rare occurrence of spawning are the jockey mobs, which is a mob riding another mob, spider/chicken jockeys and the skeleton horsemen are one of the few jockeys found in the Overworld.

Some mobs (like the snow golem and the wither) require that the player "construct" them before being able to spawn. The iron golem can spawn naturally and can also be constructed. The ender dragon can be respawned with four end crystals.

Players can also spawn mobs easily by using a spawn eggs in Creative mode, or the /summon command.

### Despawning
Main article: Spawn § Despawning
Many mobs despawn (cease to exist) after a certain amount of time if far enough from the player. In Java Edition, most passive mobs do not despawn, while most monsters do. In Bedrock Edition, almost all mobs despawn.

## Behavior
A pig emitting smoke particles upon death.
Mobs are affected by the environment in the same ways as the player; they are subject to physics, and they can be hurt by the same things that harm the player (catching on fire, falling, drowning, attacks from weapons, the /kill command, etc.). Some mobs may be resistant or immune to certain hazards, such as some Nether mobs, which are immune to fire. All aquatic mobs except dolphins are immune to drowning. Mobs can ride minecarts and other mobs can climb up ladders. When mobs are killed, they turn to dust and drop items that may be useful resources. Each type of mob in Minecraft has a certain AI (artificial intelligence) system with different behaviors and mechanics. Mobs ordinarily wander around at random if there is a player within 32 blocks and usually avoid walking off blocks high enough to cause falling damage. Many mobs have an advanced path-finding system that allows them to navigate through obstacles to get to a desired object or destination. Passive mobs flee in random directions after being hurt, while hostile mobs face and chase/attack the player as soon as the player comes close. Neutral mobs remain neutral until a player or mob provokes it (usually by attacking), at which point the neutral mob becomes hostile toward and attacks the entity that hit it. Most mobs are aware of players within (a Euclidian distance) 16 blocks of them, but some can see farther. Conversely, most mobs can be heard by players up to 16 blocks away. Mobs are harmless to players in Creative mode.

Most mobs cannot see through most solid blocks, including semi-transparent blocks such as ice, glass, tall grass, or glass panes. In Java Edition, all mobs (except for wardens[2]) do not try to avoid walking over rails tracks unless pushed onto the rails by other mobs.


## List of mobs
Mobs are listed and classified by their nature from the player's perspective. For more details on a particular mob, click on them to view their individual page.

### Passive mobs
Passive mobs are harmless mobs (except for the pufferfish and villagers) that do not attempt to attack the player, even when provoked or attacked, though some of them may attack other mobs. Most of them can be bred or tamed.

### Neutral mobs
Neutral mobs are sometimes passive and sometimes hostile toward the player. These mobs usually require provocation from the player in one way or another to attack or become hostile, while some can be naturally-hostile and have a way to be pacified.

### Hostile mobs
Hostile mobs are dangerous, aggressive mobs that always attack the player within their respective detection ranges. Non-hostile mobs such as chickens, skeleton horses and spiders can be mounted by hostile mobs on rare occasions.

### Boss mobs
Boss mobs are special hostile mobs that are distinctly more dangerous and tougher than other mobs. They do not spawn randomly, and are confronted intentionally. All of them also have a bossbar featuring their name and health. Boss mobs provide unique challenges but also equivalent rewards.

Only contains a few mobs that never spawn naturally in-game as they can only be summoned with the /summon or spawn eggs (except for old villagers and old zombie villagers, they cannot be obtained in normal game). Unlike the other unused mobs, agents and NPCs are available naturally in Minecraft Education on Tutorial Worlds.

## Mob vote
In 2016, Jeb held an informal poll on Twitter in which the public voted on adding the llama to Minecraft over the alpaca.[3][4] In the six annual Minecraft events MINECON Earth 2017, MINECON Earth 2018, MINECON Live 2019, Minecraft Live 2020, Minecraft Live 2021 and Minecraft Live 2022, the public also voted on a mob to be added to Minecraft. In the first vote, the winner was the phantom (then known as "Mob B" or "The Monster of the Night Skies"). In the second, the winner was the taiga biome and the fox. In the third, the winner was the mountain biome and the goat (the swamp was ranked second and was updated in the Wild Update, adding frogs and tadpoles). In the fourth, the winner was the glow squid. In the fifth, the winner was the allay. In the sixth, the winner was the sniffer. In the seventh, the winner was the armadillo. Shortly before the second vote, the China Edition had a unrelated popularity poll, the winner of which was the panda. Shortly after the second vote, there was also a vote for which new cat skin would be added, the winner of which was Jellie.

## Classification
Most of the mobs are divided into different types, such as the animals or the monsters, but some creatures are assigned to a more detailed group. There are a total of four mob classifications that have different effects than other mobs.

### Weaknesses and immunities
Some mobs are weak or immune to certain kinds of damage. Sea creatures, such as turtles, take more damage from tridents that are enchanted with Impaling.‌[Java Edition  only]‌[until JE Combat Tests] Skeletons and their variants are immune to drowning. All undead mobs are healed by potions of Harming, but take extra damage from weapons enchanted with Smite, along with taking damage from Potions of Healing. Many of these weaknesses and immunities are a result of what category (see below) of mobs that the mob falls into.

### Undead mobs
A dying zombie.
Main article: Undead
This group of mobs includes bogged‌[upcoming: JE 1.21], drowned, old zombie villagers, husks, phantoms, skeletons, skeleton horses, strays, withers, wither skeletons, zoglins, zombies, zombie horses, zombie villagers, and zombified piglins. These mobs are damaged by potions of Healing, healed by potions of Harming, and are immune to drowning (except for husks and zombies, which turn into zombies and drowned if drowning, respectively) and poison damage. Zombies, zombie villagers, drowned, skeletons, strays, and phantoms burn when under direct sunlight, unless they are touching water or wearing a helmet. Under the Fire Resistance effect, undead mobs still catch fire in direct sunlight but do not get hurt by the fire. All undead mobs except for drowned, phantoms, and withers sink in water. All undead mobs take extra damage from weapons enchanted with Smite, and are ignored by withers.

Most undead mobs have the ability to pick up items. Some can spawn wearing armor, or holding tools or weapons.

### Aquatic mobs
A dolphin chasing a raw cod.
Main article: Aquatic
This group of mobs includes axolotls, dolphins, squids, glow squids, guardians, elder guardians, tadpoles, turtles, cod, salmon, pufferfish, and tropical fish, but not drowned.[5] They take extra damage from tridents enchanted with Impaling,‌[Java Edition  only]‌[until JE Combat Tests] and, except axolotl, do not cause pufferfish to inflate nor take damage from them. All aquatic mobs except dolphins are immune to drowning, and all except guardians, elder guardians, and turtles take suffocation damage if out of water for too long. Aquatic mobs have the ability to swim, whereas other mobs simply float on water or sink.
In Bedrock Edition there is no in-game classification for these mobs.

### Arthropods
A spider.
Main article: Arthropods
This group consists of mobs based on arthropods, namely bees, cave spiders, endermites, silverfish, and spiders. They take extra damage and receive the Slowness IV effect when attacked with weapons enchanted with Bane of Arthropods.

### Illagers
Illagers attacking villagers on a raid
Main article: Illager
This group includes pillagers, illusioners‌[JE  only], evokers, and vindicators. They are immune to evoker fangs damage and ignored by vindicators named "Johnny". They are hostile toward adult villagers, wandering traders, iron golems and players in Survival or Adventure mode. Ravagers, witches, and vexes accompany them in raids but are not illagers themselves. Illusioners (and witches‌[Bedrock Edition  only]) can see players or targets through blocks.

### Knockback resistance
Some non-boss mobs resist a percentage of knockback from attacks.

| Mob              | Knockback resistance              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Agent            | 100% (are invulnerable)           |
| Drowned          | 0%–5% (determined onspawn)        |
| Hoglin           | 60%                               |
| Husk             | 0%–5% (determined on spawn)       |
| Glow Squid       | 85%                               |
| Iron Golem       | 100%                              |
| NPC              | 100% (are invulnerable)           |
| Ravager          | 70%‌[JE  only]<br/>50%‌[BE  only] |
| Squid            | 85%                               |
| Shulker          | 100%                              |
| Warden           | 100%                              |
| Zoglin           | 60%                               |
| Zombie           | 0%–5% (determined on spawn)       |
| Zombie Villager  | 0%–5% (determined on spawn)       |
| Zombified Piglin | 0%–5% (determined on spawn)       |
