## Obtaining
### Crafting
| Ingredients     | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Armadillo Scute |                 |

## Usage
Wolves wearing wolf armor.
Only adult tamed wolves can wear armor.

### Protection
Using wolf armor on a wolf that the player has tamed equips it onto the wolf.

Wolf armor absorbs all damage done to the wolf with some exceptions (see the list below), until its durability runs out. When the armor absorbs damage, the wolf does not emit a hurt noise.

Wolf armor does not absorb damage dealt by the following damage sources:

- Drowning
- Freezing
- Suffocating
- Magic
- Thorns
- TheWither effect
- Thevoid
- Being outside theworld border
- Entity cramming
- /kill
- Warden's sonically-charged shriek

If the owner uses shears on a wolf that is wearing armor, the armor gets unequipped from the wolf.

If a wolf dies while equipped with wolf armor, the armor is dropped.

### Durability
Wolf armor loses one point of durability for each point of damage absorbed. If the damage of an attack exceeds the remaining durability, all damage is absorbed anyway. Wolf armor produces sound, particles, and becomes more visually damaged when reduced to 60, 44 and 20 durability points.

Using an armadillo scute on a wolf wearing wolf armor heals 8 points of the armor's durability.

### Dyeing
Main article: Dyeing § Dyeing armor
