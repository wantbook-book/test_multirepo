## Obtaining
### Mining
Coal ore when mined using a pickaxe drop 1 piece of coal. If the pickaxe is enchanted with Fortune, it may drop an extra piece per level of Fortune, up to a maximum of 4 with Fortune III.

### Mob loot
Wither skeletons have a 1⁄3 chance of dropping a single coal upon death. The maximum amount of coal is increased by 1 per level of Looting. The chance of a wither skeleton not dropping any coal can be found using the formula 2 / (Looting Level + 3). For example, Looting III gives a 1⁄3 chance of not dropping any coal. All other amounts have an equal chance of occurring.

### Fuel
When used in a furnace as a fuel, a piece of coal lasts 80 seconds (smelting up to 8 items), like charcoal. Coal used as fuel lasts more than 5 times longer than wood planks or wood logs used as fuel, being more efficient than any other use of wood for smelting in Java Edition, but outstripped by wooden slabs in Bedrock Edition. 

Coal and charcoal are also the only fuels accepted by furnace minecarts. They provide three minutes of transit each.

### Trading
Novice-level fisherman villagers have a 50% chance to buy 10 coal for one emerald.

In Java Edition, novice-level armorer and toolsmith villagers have a 40% chance of offering to buy 15 coal for one emerald. Novice-level weaponsmith villagers and apprentice-level butcher villagers have 2⁄3 chance of offering to buy 15 coal for one emerald.

In Bedrock Edition, novice-level armorer, toolsmith, and weaponsmith villagers and apprentice-level butcher villagers buy 15 coal for one emerald.

Trades that involve coal cannot be substituted by charcoal.
