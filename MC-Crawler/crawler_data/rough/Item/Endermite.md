## Spawning
Endermites have a 5% chance to spawn when a player-thrown ender pearl lands. They spawn at the player's original position when the pearl lands‌[Java Edition  only], or at the pearl's landing site‌[Bedrock Edition  only].

An endermite despawns within 2 minutes, regardless of the player's distance, except for when it has been named with a name tag.

## Drops
### On death
Endermites drop 3 experience orbs when killed by a player or tamed wolf.
