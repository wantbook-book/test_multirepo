## Planned
For upcoming versions to the game, see Planned versions § Java Edition.

These features are planned to come to Minecraft sometime in the future.

### Combat changes
Main article: Java Edition Combat Tests
A new combat system is currently in development, containing changes such as the player only being able to attack when their weapon is fully drawn. However, as of 2024, the latest combat test is Combat Test 8c, which was released in August 2020.

### Voted updates
The desert and savanna biome reworks are the two remaining biome frameworks from the MINECON Earth 2018 biome chooser vote. Although no date has been given, both are promised to be updated in a future update:[1][2]

- Deserts will be given palm trees, oases, and meerkats.
- Savannas will be given baobab trees, termites, and ostriches.

The badlands biome rework is the last remaining biome rework from the MINECON Live 2019 biome vote, as the winning mountains rework was implemented in 1.18, and the swamp rework was part of 1.19. The badlands are promised to be updated in an unspecified future update:

- Badlands will be given vultures, tumbleweed, and a new cactus based on thePrickly Pear.

Other live votes did not promise that the losing options would be planned; for information on those features, see the "Mentioned" section.

### Super Fancy graphics
Docm77 confirmed in a tweet that sometime in the future, a new graphics setting will be added to Minecraft called "super fancy". It is unknown whether it is the "Fabulous!" graphics setting added in Java Edition 1.16 Pre-release 1 or another new one. The use of OpenGL 3.2 for rendering in Java Edition 1.17 may lead toward the Super Fancy graphics. This could also be a reference to the Ray Tracing functionality in Bedrock Edition or the scrapped Super Duper Graphics Pack.[3]

### Full split of liquids from blocks


Java Edition 1.13 added waterlogging, marking the start of the separation between liquids and blocks. An in-development screenshot showing water occupying leaves and flowers, referred to as having "no water blocks", was released in 2018.[4] However, water and lava still currently exist as blocks, and so far only water sources can occupy other blocks through the waterlogged block state; flowing water and bubble columns cannot occupy other blocks, and both still and flowing lava cannot occupy other blocks at all.

Having water only occupy one side of a block like a glass pane, but not the other, is also something that has been considered.[5]

### Phasing out of NBT-based crafting recipes
In Java Edition 1.14, numerous new blocks were implemented as replacements for certain "complex" crafting recipes, with the replaced crafting recipes relying on NBT data. This included moving inventory tool repair to the grindstone, banner modification to the loom, and map modification to the cartography table. However, several more NBT based crafting recipes still exist, and these are planned to be phased out.[6] Certain blocks that may be added in the future to further this goal include a dedicated fireworks customization block.

In Java Edition 1.14.3, tool repair crafting recipes were reimplemented.

Java Edition 1.20.5 removes the concept of item NBT entirely, making the future of this scheme unclear.

### Shaders
On the feedback site, shaders (resource packs that override the vanilla shaders) were marked as announced, meaning that they were going to be implemented. This feature was partially implemented in 1.16 and 1.17, as resource packs can enable similar effects.

### Farming nerf
Somewhere in 1.16, developers stated that certain changes would be made to functionality exploited in several farms. In particular:

- Fortress mobs can spawn anywhere inside of the boundary of a nether fortress rather than only at the roads.
- Angryzombified piglinsdrop experience even when not killed by the player directly.

The sculk mechanics introduced in 1.19 may be intended as a replacement.

### Explosion smoke
In Java Edition 1.15 Pre-release 1, black smoke particles which were emitted by explosions were removed due to poor implementation, which was a major source of explosion-related lag. Reintroduction of these particles is planned for an unspecified future version.[7]

## Delayed or scrapped
These features were initially promised to be implemented in a specific update, but were later postponed and have not currently been made part of another update.

### Fletching table functionality
Fletching tables are set to gain functionality in a later update, similar to what happened with smithing tables (originally added as a generic villager job site block and then received player functionality in a future update). Originally, this was planned for "the next major themed update".[8] Later, it was stated that functionality wasn't a guarantee for 1.16.[9] Later, it was confirmed that Fletching tables wouldn’t be gaining functionality in 1.16.[10] To this day, they still have no functionality beyond serving as the workplace block for fletcher villagers.

### Bundle
 Originally announced for the Caves & Cliffs update, development of this item was delayed for a future version.[11] Bundles are a storage item that can be used for managing items inside the player's inventory, and allow for combination of multiple item types within single inventory slots. As of Java Edition 1.20.4, they are still obtainable by enabling the “Bundle” experimental toggle when creating a new world.

### Updates to birch forests and other biomes

 In Minecraft Live 2021, it was stated that The Wild Update would focus on biome diversity and immersion, giving a unique identity and atmosphere to different biomes. The birch forest was used as an example to demonstrate this new atmosphere, and concept art pieces depicting an improved birch forest with new flowers, shelf fungi, tree branches and fallen logs were shown. Later it was stated that "concept art is not a commitment" and that this part of the update was now "not something we have continued working with" in an Ask Mojang episode.[12]

### Firefly
Main article: Firefly
 Fireflies were originally going to be eaten by frogs to produce froglights, but this was scrapped due to the fact that some species of fireflies are poisonous to some species of frogs in real life.[13] They would have glowed in the dark and been two pixels in size, which would have made them the smallest mob in the game. It was officially confirmed that they were scrapped for the 1.19 update in an Ask Mojang episode.[12]

## Partially implemented
These features had been shown by a Mojang staff member, but had no further development or were canceled shortly after. 

### Biomes
| Biome                         | Characteristics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Image |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Sky                           | A hidden biome beforeJava Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4, this biome was exclusive to, and the sole biome of, theSky dimension. It would generate floating islands with oceans of air surrounding them. Trees were uncommon. No weather occurred here. It had small patches of snow, although it would not reaccumulate if destroyed. Its foliage color was green with some extra blue hue. This biome was introduced inJava Edition Beta 1.6along with the Sky dimension itself. While the Sky dimension was removed, its biome and associated terrain generation were repurposed for use inthe End. |       |
| Ice Desert(corner case biome) | A biome in the code beforeJava Edition Beta 1.8that was supposed to generate at maximum coldness and dryness, but did not actually generate due to bugs. It was a biome of sand with snow on top of it and hadsnowfallandice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |       |

### Dirt slab
The dirt slabs, replacing all the dirt (not grass) blocks.
 Before stone slabs were added to 0.26, Notch ran a test of dirt slabs.[14]

In the original Caves & Cliffs announcement, an item called the brush was showcased, which appeared to be able to lower the height of certain blocks. However, it has been confirmed that this was only a special breaking animation, and couldn't be used to physically make slabs.[citation needed] The showcased animation has since been changed, and it now only applies to suspicious sand and suspicious gravel.

### Sky dimension
Main article: Sky dimension
A plain sky dimension.
The Sky dimension was a planned dimension, intended to be the opposite of the Nether. It could be accessed using third-party programs, but portals to the Sky dimension were never implemented. The idea was ultimately scrapped[15][16][17][18][19][20] and its code was reused to make the End, which can be seen in versions prior to 14w17a as the End's technical biome was still referred to in the debug menu as "Sky".

Unlike the Sky dimension, the End has a dark purple sky, no clouds, and the floating islands are made entirely of end stone.

With the addition of the buffet functionality in Java Edition 1.13 snapshot 18w15a, this can be distantly recreated by using the "Floating Islands" option. The addition of custom world generation in Java Edition 1.16.2 snapshot 20w28a also included a minecraft:floating_islands noise preset offering similar functionality.

### Fallen trees
The implementation of fallen trees (like those currently in Bedrock Edition) has been brought up. In 2012 Dinnerbone shared a screenshot of a fallen tree in Java Edition, however this appears to have never actually been undertaken beyond this brief mention.[21] Fallen trees have been present in Bedrock Edition since Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha in 2014, but remain conspicuously absent from Java Edition. In Minecraft Live 2021, a fallen tree was present in concept art of a birch forest, however this also was not implemented.

- Image from Minecraft Live of a fallen tree in concept art.

### Colored wood planks
Original image of proposed colored wood planks released by Dinnerbone.
                Dinnerbone briefly thought about implementing colored wood planks, releasing a test image on his Twitter page. This however never got implemented, as can be seen from the following quotes. The idea was eventually replaced with stained terracotta.

Later updates have since then introduced new wood sets resembling some of the dyed plank colors, with The Update that Changed the World adding orange and brown planks in the form of acacia and dark oak wood, the Nether Update adding magenta and cyan planks in the form of crimson and warped wood, The Wild Update adding red planks in the form of mangrove wood, and Trails & Tales adding yellow and pink planks in the form of bamboo and cherry wood.

### Colored lighting
Ryan Holtz mentioned in 2013 that colored lighting was being experimented on and might come in the future.[25] Later he shared screenshots and a video of what this unimplemented colored lighting looked like, claiming it was never implemented due to not being performant enough.[26]

- Multicolored torches.
- Red lava glow.
- Stained glass turning light purple.




### Blaze3D
A new Java Edition rendering pipeline called Blaze3D has been confirmed many times by Searge.[27][more information needed] There are also many references to this system in the game files, although it has not yet been fully implemented.[verify][28]

### Sculk jaw
  This block was seen at Minecraft Live 2020 as part of the deep dark announcement. Walking on it would change its texture, and it is presumed that it would do damage to the player and that it could be broken with the hoe like with other sculk blocks.

The block was presumed to be added in The Wild Update, but kingbdogz revealed that it was unlikely to be added in the final release.[29] In the end it was not added.

## Mentioned
These features were mentioned at one point, but later abandoned or their current status is unknown. Note that some of these features were mentioned by developers who either no longer work at Mojang Studios, or no longer work on Minecraft.

### Mobs
There have been several cases of mobs being mentioned by developers as potential candidates for being added to the game.

#### Red dragon
Notch revealed during the 8th Seecret Friday Update that he was planning to add dragons.[30] Later, he mentioned dragons again during MINECON 2010.[31]

On October 12th, 2011, he announced on Twitter that after the addition of the ender dragon, he was planning to add "slightly less dangerous" red dragons, which would be able to land and wouldn't destroy terrain.[32]

Dragons were originally planned for the Overworld.
In a Reddit thread on the same day, when questioned about how ender dragons phase through blocks, Notch went on record saying that "less overpowered" red dragons in the Overworld that wouldn't go through terrain would eventually be added.[33][34] However, the red dragon has not subsequently been added.

Jeb informed participants of his AMA on Reddit that he would add red dragons, but was unsure exactly how.[35]

On October 22, 2013, Dinnerbone tweeted that the red dragon is "shelved" and not in development.

|  | “ | It was never promised, we have no plans to add a red dragon at this time. | „ |
|--|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
|  |   | — Dinnerbone [36]                                                         |   |

Later, on December 15, 2013, a Dinnerbone post on Reddit indicated his belief that red dragons likely will be implemented at some point:

| “ | I'm sure one day there will be. Not right now though. | „ |
|---|-------------------------------------------------------|---|
|   | — Dinnerbone[37]                                      |   |

This was also turned into a joke by kingbdogz.[38]

#### Alpaca
In 2016, Jeb was planning on adding alpacas, but due to other developers wanting llamas instead, he held an informal poll on Twitter in which the public voted on adding the llama over the alpaca.[39][40]

#### 
Three creatures were present in the MINECON Earth 2017 vote. One was a sea creature known as "Mob A, The Monster of the Ocean Depths", or the barnacle. It would have spawned in deep water and attacked players with a tentacle-like tongue to pull players down and drown them.

Another was "Mob C, The Great Hunger." It would have had a large mouth capable of removing enchantments from items and would have camouflaged itself by entering the ground with its mouth open upward. Jeb mentioned that the mob wouldn't have been aggressive, only damaging the player if they accidentally fell into its mouth, and it wouldn't have stripped enchantments from players' items unless players fed it intentionally.[41] Its functionality was eventually replaced by the grindstone.

The other mob was "Mob D, The Hovering Inferno." It would have looked like a large blaze with shields instead of rods, and would have spawned with groups of blazes in the nether. This mob however appears in the Minecraft Dungeons DLC Flames of the Nether, and the board game Minecraft: Portal Dash, under the name "Wildfire".

Mob B, the Monster of the Night Skies, was the phantom, which won the vote and was added in the Update Aquatic.[42]

- Mob A, Monster of the Ocean Depths
- Mob C, the Great Hunger
- Mob D, the Hovering Inferno

#### 
In September 2018, a poll was held in which Chinese users could vote on which "national treasure" they thought would be added to Minecraft, to promote the release of Minecraft China. There were five options: giant panda, Chinese alligator, snub-nosed monkey, white-lipped deer, or baiji.[43] It was stated on Minecraft Feedback[44] that alligators and/or crocodiles, if implemented into the game, would likely not be hostile mobs as, like the shark (which was outright rejected), hostile mobs had to be fantasy creatures. It is unknown whether any of these mobs will be added.

According to a now taken down tweet by Aubrey Norris, Microsoft’s Senior Manager, this vote had no bearing whatsoever.[45]

- Chinese alligator
- Snub-nosed monkey
- White-lipped deer
- Baiji

#### 
In MINECON Earth 2018, a biome vote was held between which biome should be the priority to update next. The updated biomes would also come with brand new mobs. There were three options: desert, savanna, or taiga. The taiga won the vote and was updated in Village & Pillage. The taiga included the fox, while the desert will one day include the meerkat, and the savanna will include the ostrich and the termite. There has been no information as to when the desert and savanna will be updated.

- Meerkat
- Ostrich
- Termite

#### Zach and Coco
In November 2018, a poll was held in which users could vote on which cat should be added to Minecraft. There were three options: Jellie, Zach, or Coco.[46][47] Jellie won the vote and was added to the game in Village & Pillage.[48][49] It is unknown whether the other two cats will be added.

- Jellie, Zach and Coco

#### Vulture
See also: Minecraft Dungeons:Vulture

In MINECON Live 2019, another biome vote was held between which biome should be the priority to update next. The updated biomes would also come with brand new mobs. There were three options: badlands, swamp, or mountains. The mountains won the vote and was updated in Caves & Cliffs. The swamp came in second, and was updated in The Wild Update. The mountains included the goat, and the swamp included the frog, while the badlands will one day include the vulture. There has been no information as to when the badlands will be updated.

- Vulture

#### Moobloom and iceologer
In Minecraft Live 2020, a mob vote was held between which mob should be added to the game next. There were three options: moobloom, iceologer, or glow squid. The glow squid won the vote and was added into the game in Caves & Cliffs. Jens has mentioned that the team will add the losing mobs if, or when, they fit and can be prioritized.[50]

- Moobloom
- Iceologer

#### Glare and copper golem
In Minecraft Live 2021, another mob vote was held to determine which new mob should be added to the game. There were three options: glare, allay, or copper golem. The allay won the vote and was added to the game in The Wild Update. Jens has mentioned that the team will add the losing mobs if or when they fit and can be prioritized.[50]

- Glare
- Copper golem

#### Rascal and tuff golem
In Minecraft Live 2022, another mob vote was held to determine which new mob should be added to the game. There were three options: sniffer, rascal, or tuff golem. The sniffer won the vote and was added to the game in Trails & Tales. Jens has mentioned that the team will add the losing mobs if or when they fit and can be prioritized.[50]

- Rascal
- Tuff golem

#### Crab and penguin
In Minecraft Live 2023, another mob vote was held to determine which new mob should be added to the game. There were three options: crab, armadillo, or penguin. The armadillo won the vote and will be added to the game in Java Edition 1.20.5.

- Crab
- Penguin

#### Pigman bodyguard
The original pigman texture.
Development of a male mob which may have had no clothes was also mentioned by Dinnerbone in 2012,[51][52][53] but this is not currently being worked on. On April 14, 2020, Dinnerbone clarified that the mob was going to be a pigman bodyguard, which was naked by default so that the player could provide armor for it.[54]

#### Ambient mobs
In 2012, Jon Kågström mentioned fish, birds, and other tree animals, to "make the game seem more alive".[55] Parrots and four different fish mobs were added in 2017 and 2018, respectively.

#### Prefix mobs
Notch mentioned prefix mobs in a Brocraft stream. He gave examples of mobs such as "Burning Spiders, Giant Zombies, and Cobble Creepers." Some prefix mobs have been added in the form of cave spiders, charged creepers, strays, husks, drowned, and other mob variants. Giant zombies have technically been added, but are currently unused. In the 3D Shareware April Fools update, the ORDER.txt jokingly mentions "11 new enemy variants including Buff Crepper and Evilshroom II" for a fake game: "MineCraft 3D: Deeper and darker."

#### Lava zombie and troll
Before the implementation of hostile mobs, Notch stated that he liked the idea of monsters such as lava zombies or troll infestations which would roam the land and break things. Later, the zombie was implemented.[56]

#### Reindeer
Reindeer were another mob acknowledged and suggested initially for Christmas 2015.[57] Minecraft Earth version 0.6.0 added the Jolly Llama, which is supposed to represent a reindeer. It is currently unknown if reindeer will one day be added to Minecraft or not.

#### Camouflaging mob
A mob which camouflages with its environment was a concept considered by Jeb when designing the shulker, which was originally one of the mob's mechanics during development - the mob would camouflage with the surroundings, but due to difficulties with the code and rendering, he decided to abandon this element of the mob. He stated however that it may happen in the future.[58]

#### Illager variants
In 2017, a jocular suggestion regarding adding more types of illagers was posted. One of them, the pillager, has been implemented in Java Edition 1.14. In Minecraft Dungeons, there is a mob known as the iceologer, known internally as the Chillager. This mob was also part of the 2020 mob vote.[59][60][61][62]

#### More ocean creatures
Notch commented that sea monsters were a possibility on Minecast on July 21, 2010.[citation needed] He particularly noted the possibility of sharks, though Mojang has since then denied that they will be added. Hostile aquatic mobs like the guardian and drowned have been added since then. A more recent developer hinted about adding mobs involved adding seals/sea lions and/or orcas.[63] This may be related to dolphins, which were added about a month later in 18w15a.

#### Soul fire blazes
Soul Fire Blazes were talked about by Jeb. He stated that he doesn't want to make another mob variant, but that it would be interesting to make a mob connected to soul fire.[64] In Minecraft Live 2023 it was mentioned that in 1.21 a blue mob named breeze with similar visual design will be added.[65]

#### Snails
Snails were mentioned by Xilefian, in the context of how he would hypothetically implement them. He would make their design a cube "the shape and size of a player's head, like a mini shulker"; unlike a shulker, only the shell would be visible, and it would have solid collision and require a pickaxe to mine. It is currently unknown if this mob will be added.
[66]

### Biomes and environment
#### Audio loops
Main article: Ambience § Audio loops
Loops were unused sounds, found in the game files, and were possibly meant for when the player is in a specific type of location (i.e., in caves, forests, the ocean, or beside a waterfall).

#### Seasons
Dinnerbone mentioned on Twitter that he was experimenting with adding seasons, and varying the length of day and night according to season. He also mentioned it during Minecon 2013.[67][68] Seasons may include changes in color of tree leaves and may also be tied to real time.[69][70] The later released Minecraft Dungeons has a location called Pumpkin Pastures, which resembles an autumn-themed forest biome. Autumn-colored trees also appear in forest biomes in Minecraft Legends.

#### Trees
Several features regarding trees have been mentioned throughout the game's history.

Notch mentioned branches in a blog post during Indev. The addition of sideways logs seems to be an alternative for branches.[71] Implemented on chorus trees, acacia trees and cherry trees, but not on ordinary trees.

Two tree species were mentioned at the biome vote for MINECON 2018 called the palm and baobab. However, both trees' host biomes were voted against and the trees have yet to appear in-game despite being promised implementation later.

#### Cave and underground features
Many features relating to the underground and caves have been mentioned historically, but are yet to be seen in-game. Some suggestions which were approved by Mojang include rainbow crystalline caves[72] and cave maps, considered "an interesting idea" by Notch.[73] 1.13 added buffet worlds, which has an option for cave-like generation.

More ores and cave types was a general target proposed by Dinnerbone in late 2013.[74] Since this post, flooded underwater caves have been implemented, along with 1.16 adding ancient debris and nether gold ore, and 1.17 adding copper ore and amethyst.

In Minecraft Live 2020, Caves & Cliffs update was announced, bringing more new types of caves.

#### Nether features
Multiple features relating to the Nether have been proposed and acknowledged, such as utilizing the space above the Nether ceiling for something else,[75] non-rectangular nether portals,[76] and nether portals placing players in front if possible.[77]

During the development of the Nether Update, other ideas were discussed, such as dyeable nether portals, which were dismissed as not being priority by Jeb.[78] As a joke feature in Java Edition 20w14∞, funky portals were added and would change color depending on the text data found in a written book.

#### Cubic chunks
This refers to changing the chunk format to make chunks 16 blocks tall, allowing for infinite world height. Ryan Holtz discussed it with Erik Broes, but they decided they couldn't implement it, because of the difficulty of solving problems such as the occlusion of sky light.[79] The feature was previously rejected by Notch for similar reasons.[80]

### Blocks and items
#### 
Dinnerbone said on Twitter he would like to add weapons/tools that cannot be crafted, and could only obtained through treasure chests/trading, etc. For example, bows with faster drawback (somewhat implemented with the addition of Quick Charge), boots that increase health, or night vision helmets. However, the attribute system has to be finished first.[81][82][83][84]

Frost Walker and Mending were implemented as treasure enchantments in 1.9 as well as the Curses of Binding and Vanishing in 1.11, and tridents have been implemented in 1.13 as drowned-exclusive weapons, somewhat implementing this feature. In 1.16, treasure enchantments have also been made less accessible (therefore more rare) via nerfing AFK fishing, and the new Soul Speed enchantment is exclusively obtainable through bartering with piglins.

#### Steel
Multiple references to steel were made early on in the game's development. Notch had stated that it could be made using coal and iron ore,[85] and that it could be used for armor and weapons more powerful than iron.[86] In-game, flint and steel is crafted using iron ingots, considering the lack of steel and the need of a “fire striker”, despite the name of the former.

#### Spike block
Spikes received a mention in mid-2009 by Notch in a blog post.[85] These were originally planned for Java Edition Beta 1.7,[citation needed] working by extending and retracting spikes (and making them more "spike pistons" than anything),[citation needed] but were replaced by sticky pistons.[citation needed] On May 28, 2012, Dinnerbone stated that he'd like to add spike blocks, but is unsure of how to implement them.[87]

The 1.17 update implemented pointed dripstone, which can damage mobs and players that fall on them, or are crushed by them.

### User interface and modifications
#### Inventory changes
An inventory rewrite was originally added in the snapshot 14w07a for Java Edition 1.8, but a roadblock was hit and Mojang had to shelve the change before the release of 1.8.[88] Other changes to the inventory have been mentioned, including spectators can now look at people's inventory, visible health/armor bar on all players,[89] seeing players' GUI when spectating from their POV[90] and the return of shift-double-clicking.[91][92]

#### Off-hand changes
Changes with the off-hand slot added in Java Edition 1.9 were planned on being added to Minecraft sometime in the future.[93] Specifically, the player would no longer be able to attack or place blocks with any item in their off-hand slot, similar to Bedrock Edition. However, players would still be able to hold items in the off-hand slot, which still made the off-hand useful for maps and such. Also, blocking would still be able to be activated if the player is holding a shield in their off-hand. However, this regression was later retracted due to massive community backlash.

#### Friends list
Notch mentioned on his blog, The Word of Notch, that friends lists would be added after Beta 1.8.[94] The Minecraft documentary team of 2 Player Productions filmed a Keynote roadmap, containing these lines.[95][96] Kristoffer mentioned on Twitter that he is currently working on friends lists for Scrolls, then for other Mojang games. These will be available for players with Mojang accounts. At Minecon 2012, Jeb stated that it would be a large implementation on the server-side and will be used for all Mojang games, and that is a big project.[97][98]
With the release of 1.16.4, the social interactions menu functions somewhat like a friends menu but not exactly, but the Xbox account system currently used on Bedrock and Java has a friends system.

#### Resource packs
Grum mentioned that there may be easier customization of chat and sheep colors.[99]

Since 1.16, the "color" tag in raw NBT text has been able to accept hexadecimal colors:

/tellraw @s {"text":"proof","color":"#FF0000"}

Ryan Holtz stated that he wanted to improve the rendering system to allow for customizable models and animations.[100][101] Dinnerbone later stated that player models would not be able to be changed.[102]

#### Lua scripting
Lua Scripting was a feature mentioned by Notch as a way to create server-side modifications.[103] The server would be able to create custom commands, assign certain server functions to blocks, and create user groups. Players would not have to download scripts within or outside of the client, and therefore no client-side modifications will be necessary. Notch said that he wanted Lua to be an extension for Minecraft, but did not want Lua to turn Minecraft into a game engine.

Lua scripting has been further hinted at by Searge.[27]

Certain plugins such as Spigot or Bukkit support Lua scripting implementation into servers, however these plugins are not created by nor affiliated with Mojang Studios and thus are not an official means in which to implement Lua scripting.

#### 
Main article: Add-on § History
The Plugin API,[104][105] dubbed "Workbench", is a feature that allows mod developers to easily add more content to the game. In contrast to mods, plugins will not require any alteration of the minecraft.jar file itself, although they will also be slightly limited in their feature set.[106][107] The Bukkit team will help make the official Plugin API.[108]

### Brief mentions
These features were briefly mentioned, but no further information was given after it's mention.

#### General features
- Partially implemented: More structures in biomes.[109]Since this was mentioned,woodland mansions,end cities,shipwrecks,ocean ruins,pillager outposts,ruined portals,bastion remnants,ancient citiesandtrail ruinshave been implemented.
- More dimensions.[110]Implemented in the April Fools' updateJava Edition 20w14∞. In the Minecraft snapshot20w21a, the ability to make custom dimensions was added.
- Partially implemented: More rare structures and terrain changes.[109]Partially added withice spikes.
- Partially implemented: AllexclusiveBedrock Editionfeatures ported to Java Edition.[111]SeeOfficial pages/Parity issue listfor more info.

#### More specific features
##### Mentioned in 2009
- In early development, Notch mentioned two more gamemodes, Team Survival Mode and Fortress Mode, which would include the ability to play Capture the Flag.[112]
	- Additionally, difficulty modes were mentioned on of which were: "Walk in the Park" being the easiest, "Easy" which was added, and "Armageddon" being difficult even with 32 people.[113]
- Partially implemented:Cobwebblocks being created byspiders[114]. This functionality appears as an attack inMinecraft Dungeons.
- After denying the addition of penguins, Notch stated that a penguin hat would be a pretty neat Easter egg.[115]

##### Mentioned in 2010
- Animated swingingdoors.[116]
- Partially implemented: Megabeasts were mentioned as a potential addition for late-game challenges along with ill omens followed by "a night of absolute horror".

- Partially implemented: Dungeon Mode: Same asSurvival mode, except players can't craft or modify the world. Planned to have been used to play missions on pre-made maps.[126]The later-implementedAdventure modefunctions similarly.
- "Clan" mode. Most likely the same as Team Survival mode mentioned in 2009.[126]
- Server-side scripting.[126]
- Land claim flags: planting a flag (possibly costs gold in Survival mode) claims an area of land. No monsters can spawn or die from age in that area, and only selected players can build in that area.[126]
- Smoke block: would be generated by fire, be passable, cast shadows, float upward and disappear after a short time.[126]1.14addedcampfires, which generate smoke particles similar to what was mentioned, but they are not blocks and do not cast shadows.
- Gravity: all blocks except possiblyobsidianwould be affected by gravity. Floating islands would need obsidian blobs to stay afloat.[126]Notch later stated that he disliked the idea.[127]
- More crafting templates: arrows, food, armor, etc.[126](Possibly added inJava Edition 1.14.)
- In-game anti-cheat: make the server check for flying, no-clip and increased speed. Add those options to the client, but only enable if the server says it's okay.[126]
- Partially implemented: Make moss grow on rock (likely means thatmossy cobblestonewould spread tocobblestone)[126]. In 1.17,glow lichenwas introduced which functions similarly to the idea growing on stone in caves and spreading withbone meal.

### 
Main article: April Fools' Day jokes

### Minecraft 2.0 changelog
The changelog for the April Fools' Day joke update Minecraft 2.0 contained numerous features that were not actually included.[233] Despite the changelog being part of the joke, many of these features have since been implemented into the game.

The changelog is shown below.
