Bone meal does not affect:

- Cactus
- Vines
- Nether wart
- Sugar cane‌[Java Edition  only]
- Chorus plants, or other plants not listed above.

#### Wasting bone meal
Bone meal can be used on the following objects in the following situations, consuming it without any real effect:

- Onshort grass,ferns, andseagrassthat do not have enough space to grow.[3]
- Onseagrassthat doesn't havewaterabove.
- On adark oak saplingthat is not in a group of four.[4]
- On amushroomthat is not on a block that allows it to grow into a huge mushroom.[5]
- On asea picklethat is already in a group of four and has no valid locations to expand to.[6]
- On asea picklethat is not on acoral block.
- On abamboo(notbamboo shoot) that is blocked in the way.
- On afungusthat is not on its respectivenylium.
- Anyplantsthat can't grow due to being blocked by thebuild limit.

### Creating new plants
Using bone meal on a grass block causes foliage to sprout on and around the targeted block. Grass blocks within a 15×5×15‌[JE  only] or 7×5×7‌[BE  only] area of the target block randomly chooses which type of foliage to grow, if any (provided there is adequate space for the plant to grow). The types of foliage that can be created in this way are short grass, fern‌[BE  only], tall grass‌[JE  only], flowers, and pink petals, with the latter two being dependent on external factors like the biome and coordinates. See Flower § Flower biomes and Flower § Post-generation for more information.

Using bone meal on a 2-block flower (rose bushes, sunflowers, lilacs or peonies) cause one of the same type of flower to drop, without breaking the original. This is the only way to reproduce these flowers, since they cannot generate from using bone meal on grass blocks.

Using bone meal on a non-transparent block that is underwater generates seagrass on that block and surrounding blocks. In Java Edition, coral and coral fans may have a chance to generate in warm ocean biomes; in Bedrock Edition, coral and coral fans can be generated in any biome. In Bedrock Edition, in order to successfully use bone meal underwater, there must be 2 water blocks above the block the bone meal is being used on, and the lower one must be non-flowing water.

Using bone meal on a sea pickle on a coral block creates sea pickles. This generates sea pickles up to 3 blocks (of coral) away, so a 7 × 7 square (49 blocks) of coral may be necessary, to return the most sea pickles per given bone meal attempt (more attempts grows them more numerously, exactly - including the range of it growing, like grass with heights on grass blocks - as coral and coral fans, though those others being non-solid blocks).

Using bone meal on netherrack adjacent to nylium converts the netherrack into nylium of the same type. If both crimson and warped nylium are adjacent to the netherrack that was applied with bone meal, there is a 50% chance that either type of nylium is created.

Using bone meal on nylium causes the corresponding nether roots and both types of fungi to appear on the nylium block and other nylium, netherrack, dirt or grass blocks nearby (in a 5 × 5 total area), with the type of fungi matching the type of nylium being more common. In addition, using bone meal on warped nylium creates nether sprouts and twisting vines.

### Farmer villagers
Villagers with the farmer profession can collect bone meal from a full composter, with which they can make their crops grow faster.
