A trident can be combined with another trident in an anvil, preserving the enchantments of both.

### Mob loot
15% of drowned in Bedrock Edition (6.25% in Java Edition) spawn with a trident of random durability as their natural weapon, and only the drowned with a trident have an 8.5% chance of dropping the trident when killed by a player, increasing by 1% with each level of Looting.

Only naturally spawned drowned can spawn with a trident and have a chance of dropping one. In Java Edition, a trident held by a drowned has a chance to be enchanted, but the trident's enchantments have no effects for drowned.[1]

Drowned who are holding tridents will sometimes drop their trident at full durability if given a nautilus shell when they aren't attacking anything.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

### Thrown tridents
Tridents thrown onto the ground by a player can be picked up; however, tridents thrown by drowned cannot be picked up, similar to arrows shot by skeletons, strays, bogged, pillagers and piglins. Only the owner of a trident thrown in Creative mode or enchanted with Loyalty can pick it up; other players in Creative and players in Survival mode including its own owner can't pick up the trident thrown in Creative.

### Vault loot

  

This section describes an experimental feature in Java Edition and Bedrock Edition. 
This feature is not enabled in-game by default and requires enabling the "Update 1.21" experimental data pack in Java Edition or the "Update 1.21" setting in the "Experiments" section in Bedrock Edition.

## Usage
### Drowned
Main article: Drowned
15% of drowned in Bedrock Edition, and 6.25% in Java Edition, spawn with a trident as its natural weapon. It throws the trident at its opponent every 1.5 seconds, dealing 9 damage in normal difficulty. A drowned can throw unlimited tridents, and these tridents cannot be picked up by the player.

A villager can be turned into a zombie villager if it is killed by a trident thrown by a drowned: the chance of conversion is 0% on Easy difficulty, 50% on Normal, and 100% on Hard and Hardcore.

In Bedrock Edition, a drowned can use the trident's melee attack if its target is within three blocks. The melee attack deals 9 damage.

### Melee attack
Pressing attack while holding a trident deals damage to both mobs and players. Tridents deal 9 melee damage, and have an attack speed of 1.1 (equating to a cooldown of roughly 0.91 seconds per attack). A successful hit consumes durability of the trident.

### Ranged attack
 

Pressing and holding use while holding a trident charges it. When released at full charge, the trident is thrown and deals damage to any entity it hits. It flies on a ballistic trajectory similar to that of an arrow, but at 80% strength. If the trident hits a block, it sticks to the block. If it hits an entity, it bounces off the entity and lands nearby. It is also blocked by shields and can be retrieved once it lands in the ground. Thrown tridents can trigger wooden buttons, wooden pressure plates, and target blocks. A trident can be thrown at a chorus flower or pointed dripstone to break it, which causes the block to be dropped as its respective item.

In Bedrock Edition and Java Edition Combat Test 4, tridents can be shot by dispensers regardless of enchantment.

Tridents enchanted with Loyalty return to the thrower after hitting an entity‌[Java Edition  only]/hitting and bouncing off an entity then hitting a block‌[Bedrock Edition  only][2] or just a block. A Loyalty-enchanted trident fired from a dispenser just sticks to the block it strikes. Higher levels of enchantment result in shorter recovery times. In Java Edition, throwing a trident enchanted with Loyalty into the void destroys it,[3] while in Bedrock Edition it automatically returns to the player. Tridents (if enchanted with Loyalty), can take fire damage but still return to the player if thrown in lava. This is especially helpful in the Nether if the player is using the trident instead of a bow. If a trident enchanted with Loyalty attempts to return to a player with no available inventory space, the trident floats near the player until inventory space becomes available.

Thrown tridents take 1 durability damage, regardless of whether it hit an entity or not. Tridents with 1 durability remaining cannot be thrown.

Tridents enchanted with Riptide launch the player a certain distance when thrown, with the distance increasing for higher enchantment levels. They can be thrown only if the player is standing in water, or if it is raining on the block they are standing on. If the player charges it but walks into a nearby dry area, the charge is canceled. If the player throws a Riptide trident and collides with a mob, the mob takes melee damage (including critical damage if the player is falling). In Java Edition tridents enchanted with Riptide take one durability damage upon throwing, and lose an additional 1 durability if it collides with an entity on both editions. Each level of Riptide increases the distance traveled by six blocks. The enchantment at level one launches the player nine blocks, fifteen blocks at level two, and twenty-one blocks at level three.

Tridents enchanted with Channeling summon a lightning bolt if there is a thunderstorm, although only upon hitting a mob or player standing in the rain as well as a lightning rod placed in the rain.

Unlike other projectiles, the trident does not slow down when thrown through water or lava.

In Java Edition, the Impaling enchantment affects all water mobs. In Bedrock Edition, it deals extra damage to players and mobs in water or rain.

Unlike arrows, thrown tridents do not despawn.‌[Bedrock Edition  only] Tridents despawn after 60 seconds if they are not picked up.‌[Java Edition  only][4]

** Magical damage **
Using Riptide, nearby players or mobs are dealt splash damage within an 8.25×8.25×4.25 cubical area. It stacks with the Impaling enchantment and Strength effect. Critical hits do not increase splash damage, but affect the target. 

In Bedrock Edition, thrown tridents can damage the ender dragon while resting on the bedrock fountain. In Java Edition, they act just like arrows — deflected, but burn as if they had Flame.

### Damage
Thrown tridents and splashes deal 8 damage. The damage remains the same regardless of the trident's speed. It has a faster charging speed than a bow or crossbow (barring the Quick Charge enchantment.)

#### Java Edition
In Java Edition, tridents have an attack speed of 1.1 and take ~0.91 seconds to recover.

| Attack                            | Melee      | Melee (critical) | Range      |
|-----------------------------------|------------|------------------|------------|
| Attack damage                     | 9          | 13.5× 6.75       | 8          |
| Attack Speed                      |            | 1.0              | N/A        |
| Damage/Second (DPS)               | 9.9        | 14.3             | ?          |
| Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1] | 2250× 1125 | 3375× 1687.5     | 2000× 1000 |
| Durability                        |            |                  | 250        |

1. ↑The formula to find the total lifetime damage is Durability × Damage per hit = Lifetime damage minimum (e.g., 250 × 9 = 2250). It ignores enchantments, and assumes the trident is at maximum charge

#### Bedrock Edition
In Bedrock Edition, tridents have no attack cooldown and do the following damage:

| Attack                            | Melee        | Melee (critical) | Range      |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|------------------|------------|
| Attack damage                     | 9            | 13.5× 6.75       | 8          |
| Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1] | 2259× 1129.5 | 3388× 1694       | 2008× 1004 |
| Durability                        |              |                  | 251        |

1. ↑The formula to find the total lifetime damage is Durability × Damage per hit = Lifetime damage minimum. It excludes enchantments and critical hits.

### Elytra
A trident with the Riptide enchantment can be used to propel a player with a pair of elytra, but only in rainy weather, during snowy weather in certain biomes[5] or while the player is in a body of water. A Riptide trident can boost the player to speeds as high as 125 blocks per second,[6] much faster than the 33.5 blocks-per-second speed achievable using firework rockets.

### Impaling damage
In Java Edition, the Impaling enchantment deals extra damage to all water mobs. In Bedrock Edition and in Java Edition Combat Test 3, it deals extra damage to all players and mobs in water or rain.

| Level | Increase        | Melee       | Ranged      |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| I     | adds 2.5× 1.25  | 11.5× 5.75  | 10.5× 5.25  |
| II    | adds 5          | 14× 7       | 13× 6.5     |
| III   | adds 7.5× 3.75  | 16.5× 8.25  | 15.5× 7.75  |
| IV    | adds 10         | 19× 9.5     | 18× 9       |
| V     | adds 12.5× 6.25 | 21.5× 10.75 | 20.5× 10.25 |


### Enchantments
Tridents have a base enchantability of 1 and can receive the following enchantments:
