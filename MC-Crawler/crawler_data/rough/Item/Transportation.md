## Methods

  

This section needs to be updated. 
Please update this section to reflect recent updates or newly available information.Reason: Add speed for throwing a Trident with Riptide enchantment, speed stats for striders when using boost. Add calculations for how many blocks you need to fall to reach terminal velocity vertically as of 1.18 with the increased height limit. Also, walking diagonally is faster, add info of sneaking using the Swift Sneak enchantment, and add info about walking and dashing using camels.


These speeds assume that the form of transportation is not under the effect of the Speed or Slowness, unless mentioned.

2. ↑Divide by 3 to get kilometres per game day, or by 6 to get kilometres per half-day (from dawn to sunset)
3. ↑ a bAssuming the jump key is released then held mid-air every jump

7. ↑The swimming speeds are not affected by Swiftness potions. The surface speed refers to "skimming" across the top of the water by holding the spacebar.
8. ↑Underwater refers to any part of the body submerged in water and walking on flat terrain. The Player travels the same speed regardless of if the water is 1 block deep or 2 (in observed cases).

### Potions
Using effects from potions or beacons, walking and sprinting speeds become competitive with other methods of transportation.

Each additional level of Speed allows the player to walk at nearly the sprinting speed of the previous level, and sprinting with Speed II is only slightly slower than a minecart at full speed or a boosted pig. With adequate food and potion supplies, sprinting may be more cost-effective than building high-speed transportation systems.

| Effect level | Walking speed (m/s) | Sprinting speed (m/s) |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| none         | 4.317 m/s           | 5.612 m/s             |
| Speed        | 5.181 m/s           | 6.735 m/s             |
| SpeedII      | 6.044 m/s           | 7.857 m/s             |

### Commands
Using the /effect command, extremely high or low speeds become reachable. At exceedingly high levels (100+), the player moves faster than the chunks can load.

1. ↑The player can jump up a distance of 1 1⁄4 blocks. With Jump Boost I, that increases to 1 15⁄16 blocks, and with Jump Boost II, that increases to 2 1⁄2 blocks.

Falling speed is more complex: Every tick (1⁄20 second), non-flying players and mobs have their vertical speed decremented (less upward motion, more downward motion) by 0.08 blocks per tick (1.6 m/s), then multiplied by 0.98.[note 1] This can be described as a formula: 

v(t)=0.98×(v(t−1)−0.08)

Where v(t)is the speed (in blocks/second) at the t-th tick. v(1) corresponds to the initial speed of the jump: v(1)={0Freefall0.42+0.1EJumpBoostJumping} where EJumpBoost is the level of the jump boost. Because "Speed" (in Minecraft) is defined as the Y coordinate difference between the current tick and the previous tick, the initial speed is v(1) instead of v(0).

This would produce a terminal velocity of 3.92 blocks per tick or 78.4 m/s. However, the sky isn't quite high enough for that: Falling from layer 256 to bedrock takes about 5.5 seconds, with impact at 3.5 blocks per tick (70 m/s). It is possible to fly higher in Creative mode, or by flying with elytra and then removing them, reaching terminal velocity falling from "above the sky".

1. ↑Horses have their vertical speed multiplied by 0.98 a second time in the same tick. This may or may not apply to some other mobs.

By solving the recurrence relation, it is possible to get an exact function to calculate the vertical speed of a falling player:

v(t)=0.98t−1(v(1)+3.92)−3.92

Where the velocity v is in blocks (meters) per tick, the time t is in ticks and downward motion is negative. Note that if the initial velocity is zero, the function can be simplified to v(t)=3.92×(0.98t−1).

An exact function to calculate the displacement of the player is the following:

d(t)=d(0)+50(v(1)+3.92)(1−0.98t)−3.92t

Where the displacement d is in blocks (meters), the time t is in ticks, d(0) is the initial displacement and downward displacement is negative. If the initial velocity and displacement is zero, it can be written as:

d(t)=3.92×(50×(1−0.98t)−t)

An approximate function to calculate the time it takes to fall from some height is the following:

t(d)=50−0.255102d+49.498316×W−1(−0.367861×1.005167d)

Where the height d is in blocks (meters), the time t is in ticks, initial velocity and displacement is zero, downward displacement is negative and W is the Lambert W function.

### Other modes of transportation
- Players are also able to usepistonsfor transport.
	- It is possible to constructcomplex flying machinesusing pistons,blocks of redstone,slime blocks, andhoney blocks.
- Dyingis an instant mode of transportation to the player'sbedorspawnpoint, but at the cost of all items and XP (if thekeepInventorygamerule is disabled) and the world (on Hardcore).
	- If the player has already defeated theender dragon, and is near astronghold/end portal, they can enter and exitthe Endto instantly be transported to their bed or spawn point without dying.
- Explosionknockback can send an adjacent player flying for a short distance, depending on the strength of the explosion. This is not recommended inSurvival mode.
- It is possible to mountminecartsandboatsas long as they are within 4-5 blocks (inclusive) from the player. Placing these in a straight line allows for extremely fast transport. This also works with saddledpigs, provided they stay in position (placed on posts).
