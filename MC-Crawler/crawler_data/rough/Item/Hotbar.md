## Display
All existing bars in the HUD. Clockwise starting from the bottom left: the experience bar, the health bar, the armor bar, the oxygen bar, and the hunger bar.
The HUD consists of the user's health, hunger and experience bars, the hotbar, as well as a crosshair that designates the currently focused on block or entity if the player is not playing on a mobile device and has not enabled split controls. The armor condition bar appears above the health bar if the player is wearing armor, and the oxygen bar displays above the hunger bar if the player's air supply NBT tag is below 300. Note that the health and armor bars are on the top left and the hunger and oxygen bars are on the top right if the player is in Bedrock Edition and has chosen the Pocket Edition UI.

In Creative mode, the health, hunger, oxygen, experience and armor bars are hidden.

Chat is also part of the HUD, in the bottom left corner‌[Java Edition  only]/top left corner‌[Bedrock Edition  only], showing anything recently spoken or commands recently executed. This can be expanded with T.

The textures are handled by icons.png.

### Hotbar
The hotbar in Java Edition.
The hotbar in Bedrock Edition. The inventory button is visible when using touch input.
The hotbar is a selection bar that appears on the bottom of the screen. It is where the player stores and selects commonly used items. It consists of the bottom nine slots within the player's inventory. The selected item also displays on the right side of the screen, or an empty fist if the slot is empty. When the player switches an item in hand by mouse wheel or 1-9, its name is shown above the experience level for a short period of time. This name appears in italics.

Players can dual wield allowing a second item to be shown on the left (or right if the player's main hand is set to "left"), along with an additional hotbar slot on the same side. Both the slot and the item are shown only if it contains an item, which can either be added using the GUI or by pressing "swap items." In Java Edition, it shows the off-hand slot with the items equipped on the left of the hotbar. In Bedrock Edition, this is not the case although the item is still equipped in the off-hand slot.

In Bedrock Edition, the hotbar has an additional button for the inventory. However, this is present only on mobile devices such as Android, iOS, and Windows 10 (with touch screen). On the New Nintendo 3DS Edition, the hotbar is located on the Touch Screen and is slightly different.

### Paper doll

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition. 


The paper doll is a side-view of the player displayed in the top-left corner of the screen. It shows the player's skin and any armor worn. If the player is walking, the paper doll shows the player's legs moving. If the player is sneaking, sprint-swimming, or flying with elytra, this can also be seen.

The paper doll can be turned on and off by pressing F8 on PC.

### Mobile controller

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition. 



Joystick control mode.
D-Pad control mode.

These buttons are present only in mobile versions(Android and iOS) and they are used to control the player. Players can sneak, fly and jump using the mobile controller.

In the settings under "Controls" → "Touch", players can choose between D-Pad, joystick, and joystick with crosshair aim control mode. D-Pad crosshair aim is available separate using "Split Controls" setting.

### Crosshair
The crosshair is a small cross in the middle of the screen. It shows the aim point of the tool or item being held. The crosshair inverts the colors of the area it is upon, which can result in a nearly invisible crosshair if the area is a medium gray. The crosshair is not shown if the player is playing on a mobile device and has turned off Split Controls.

If the option for the attack indicator is set to "Crosshair" mode, weapon cooldown time is indicated by a sword icon near the crosshair that fills, representing the cooldown progress.  This sword icon disappears once the weapon is fully cooled.  In this mode, if a fully cooled weapon is being held, and a mob or player is in range, the sword icon and an additional plus-sign (+) indicator is shown below the crosshair, indicating that the weapon is in range to land a full-damage blow.‌[Java Edition  only]

### Effects
All effects (other than effects with hideParticles, including Darkness from the warden[1]) the player currently has are shown on the top-right of the screen. Effects that run out sooner appear farther to the left, and effects that are about to run out start to flash. Additionally, positive effects are shown on the top, and other effects (neutral or negative) are shown on the bottom. Beacon effects have a blue (instead of gray) outline, and effects with particles hidden are not indicated in the HUD.

### Riding mobs



A mob health bar


The empty horse jump bar/camel dash bar.
The full horse jump bar/camel dash bar.
Upon mounting a camel, horse, donkey, mule, llama, pig, or strider, the mob's health bar appears above the hunger bar, which the former uses a slightly different heart texture than the player's health bar, as they are meant to look like saddles. Also, upon mounting a horse or camel, the horse jump bar/camel dash bar also appears above the experience bar. When riding a skeleton horse underwater, the oxygen bar, if necessary, appears above the mob health bar.

## Options
In the options menu, the GUI scale option changes the size of the HUD and GUI. The default setting, "auto", changes the size of the HUD and GUI depending on the size of the game window.‌[Java Edition  only]

There is an option to hide the HUD. If the player is using keyboard controls, this can also be done with F1. In Bedrock Edition, the "Hide HUD" option toggles the hotbar, crosshair, and if using touch controls, buttons. The hand, paper doll, and coordinates are separate options.

In Bedrock Edition, the /hud command can toggle the visibility of each HUD element.

Players can toggle the HUD, the vignette effect on fancy graphics, the pumpkin "view" and the block hitbox by pressing the F1 key. The F1 key will also toggle the surrounding darkness when using the spyglass.

The HUD also contains the debug screen,‌[Java Edition  only] which can be shown or hidden using F3. Pressing Shift + F3 adds the additional pie chart showing resource allocation. Pressing Alt + F3 shows the FPS and TPS chart.

The player can choose whether to use their right or left hand.‌[Java Edition  only] This option also moves the off-hand slot to the opposite side.
