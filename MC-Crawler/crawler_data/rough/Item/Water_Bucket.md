## Obtaining
### Interacting
To fill an empty bucket with water, use it on a water source block. The water is consumed in the process. Flowing water does not fill a bucket.

Using an empty bucket on a cauldron filled with water (water level 3) empties the cauldron and fills the bucket.

Water buckets can also be filled by placing an empty one in the fuel slot of a furnace, and a wet sponge into the oven slot. The bucket is filled when the smelting process completes, which also leaves the sponge dry and ready to be reused.

|              | Village        | Fisherman's chest | 1–3      | 24.2%        |

### Smelting
If an empty bucket is in the fuel slot of a furnace  when a wet sponge finishes smelting and becomes a dry sponge, the bucket fills with water. Other fuel items have to be used to smelt the wet sponge before the empty bucket is inserted. If a lava bucket is used as the fuel, it fills with water when the sponge dries out, meaning an empty bucket does not need to be inserted separately.

## Usage
Using a water bucket on a solid block places a water source block against that block, emptying the bucket; using a water bucket on a waterloggable block waterlogs the block. In the Nether, however, the water evaporates, making a fire extinguishing sound and displays smoke particles while nothing gets placed.

### Dispensers
A dispenser can be loaded with a water bucket, and when activated it places a water block directly before it, emptying the bucket. A dispenser loaded with an empty bucket and a water source right in front of it draws the source into the bucket when activated.

### Cauldrons
A single water bucket can fill a cauldron, and using an empty bucket on a water-filled cauldron fills the bucket. Empty buckets cannot be filled from partly-filled cauldrons.

### Filling bucket with mobs
Water buckets can be used on a fish, axolotl or tadpole to create a bucket of aquatic mob.

### Transportation
Main article: Tutorials/Elevators § Water elevators
Water buckets can be used as a means of quickly descending great heights in the Overworld and the End, either by creating a waterfall or using the water bucket while falling to create a safe water landing.

Water buckets can also be used to climb vertical surfaces anywhere but the Nether by repeatedly creating higher waterfalls from the bottom and swimming up them.
