## Obtaining
### Mob loot
#### Guardians and elder guardians
Guardians and elder guardians have a 2.5% chance of dropping a random fish upon death. This has a 13% chance of being pufferfish (0.325% chance of dropping a pufferfish). The chance of getting a fish can be increased by 1% per level of Looting, but the type of fish is not affected.

#### Pufferfish
Pufferfish always drop 1 pufferfish in its item form when killed. This drop is not affected by the Looting enchantment.[1]

| Source     | Roll Chance | Quantity (Roll Chance) |           |            |             |
|------------|-------------|------------------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
|            |             | Default                | Looting I | Looting II | Looting III |
| Pufferfish | 100%        | 1                      | 1         | 1          | 1           |

### Fishing
Pufferfish can be obtained through fishing with a 11.1% chance. Using any level of the Luck of the Sea enchant decreases this to 11.0%. The pufferfish catch rate can be increased by Lure, which reduces wait time generally.

In Bedrock Edition, pufferfish cannot be caught in jungle, sparse jungle, or bamboo jungle biomes.

## Usage
### Food
Pufferfish restores 1 () hunger and 0.2 saturation, but inflicts Hunger III for 15 seconds, Poison II for 1 minute, and Nausea I‌[JE  only] or II‌[BE  only] for 15 seconds. Unlike rotten flesh, it is not helpful to eat pufferfish while starving because they inflict more hunger than they earn.

### Brewing ingredient
| Name                      | Ingredients                    | Brewing recipe |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|
| Potion of Water Breathing | Pufferfish+<br/>Awkward Potion |                |
| Mundane Potion            | Pufferfish +Water Bottle       |                |

### Trading
Master-level fisherman villagers buy 1~4‌[BE  only] or four‌[JE  only] pufferfish for an emerald.

### Wolves
In Bedrock Edition, pufferfish can be used to feed a wolf, healing it by 1, but only when the wolf is not at full health. Unlike other wolf food, pufferfish cannot be used to speed up the growth of baby wolves, and cannot be used to breed them.
