### Picking up arrows
Arrows shot by players can always be picked up in Creative mode.

An arrow cannot be picked up by a player in Survival or Adventure mode if: 

- It is shot by a player inCreativemode.
- It is shot by anymobable to shoot arrows, such asskeletons,strays,pillagers, orpiglins. This includes mobs that do not shoot arrows in normal gameplay, such asillusionersand bow-wieldingwither skeletons.
	- This is the case even in Creative mode.[1]
- It is shot with anInfinity-enchantedbow.
- It is one of the two extra arrows shot with aMultishot-enchantedcrossbow.

Arrows that are stuck in a player cannot be retrieved, and the player does not drop them when killed.

### Mob loot
Skeletons and strays drop 0-2 arrows upon death. The maximum drop is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0–5 arrows with Looting III.

In Bedrock Edition, pillagers also drop 0–2 arrows upon death. The maximum drop is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 arrows with Looting III.

### Trading
Novice-level fletcher villagers have a 50% chance in Bedrock Edition, or a 2⁄3 chance in Java Edition, to sell 16 arrows for one emerald as part of their trades.

### Villager gifts
In Java Edition, any regular or tipped arrow (except for luck and Bad Luck arrows) can be obtained as a reward item from fletcher villagers when the player has the Hero of the Village status effect.

### Bartering
In Bedrock Edition, arrows can be obtained through bartering with piglins, and have a ~8.71% chance to give the player 6-12 arrows.

## Usage
See also: Bow

### Trading
In Bedrock Edition, master-level fletcher villagers have a 1⁄2 chance to tip 5 arrows with a random potion effect for 2 emeralds. In Java Edition, they have a 2⁄3 chance to tip 5 arrows with a random potion effect for 2 emeralds.

### Crafting ingredient
Arrows can be used to craft the two variants of arrows, spectral arrows and tipped arrows.

### Cauldrons
Main article: Cauldron § Holding potions
In Bedrock Edition, arrows can be used on cauldrons that contain potions to create tipped arrows.

## Behavior




Technical information related to the arrow entity has been checked in Java Edition and might differ in Bedrock Edition.

### Spawning
An arrow entity spawns when an arrow item is shot out of a bow, crossbow, dispenser, or a bow- or crossbow-wielding mob. Arrow entities spawn with a starting velocity calculated using the following process:

- The direction of the velocity is set as the facing vector of the entity that shot it, or the vector pointing straight out of a dispenser.
- The magnitude of the velocity is set as 0 to 3 for bows depending on how far they're drawn, 3.15 for crossbows, and 1.1 for dispensers.
- A random vector is added to the previously determined velocity. This vector ranges from−0.0172275⋅inaccuracyto0.0172275⋅inaccuracyon every axis. Inaccuracy is 1 for bows and crossbows, and 6 for dispensers.

Because crossbows shoot slightly faster arrows than bows but have the same inaccuracy, crossbows can feel more accurate; Their randomness is smaller in proportion to their total velocity.

### Movement
An arrow entity follows this list of steps in order when calculating its movement each game tick:

- If it is intersecting a block's collision box, itsinGroundNBT value is set to true.
- If it is on fire and in rain, water, or powder snow (including cauldrons containing water or powder snow), its fire is extinguished.

- IfinGroundis true:

- IfinGroundis false:


It calculates collisions with blocks and entities: 

It sets its target position to its current position plus its velocity.
It performs a raycast from its current position to the target position, checking for blocks to hit. If the raycast hits a block, the target position gets set to the point that was hit.
It performs a raycast from its position to the target position, checking for entities to hit.

If a block was found and no entity was found, handle effects from block collision: 

The block is activated, if applicable. For example, targets and wooden buttons are activated here.
The arrow's velocity is set to the target position minus the arrow position.
The arrow is moved directly away from the target position by 0.05 blocks
inGround is set to true.
crit is set to false.
PierceLevel is set to 0.


If any entity was found, handle effects from entity collision: 

If the entity is an Enderman, it is skipped.
The arrow attempts to damage the entity. See the Damage section for more information. If the damage fails:
If the entity has the deflects_projectiles tag, the arrow's velocity is rotated a random angle about the Y axis and scaled by 0.5.
Otherwise, its velocity is multiplied by -0.1.


- Its velocity vector is added to its position vector.
- Its velocity vector is multiplied by 0.99 if it's in air or 0.6 if it's in water (this is the "drag").
- 0.05 is subtracted from its velocity vector's y component (this is the "gravity").

The arrow movement (when not stuck in a block) can be solved as a recurrence relation to obtain the following formulas:

Vt→=0.99t⋅(V0→+[050])−[050]

Pt→=P0→+100⋅(1−0.99t)⋅(V0→+[050])−[05t0]

Where Vt→ is the velocity at tick t and Pt→ is the position at tick t. These formulas can quickly calculate the position and velocity at a future tick t given an initial position and velocity. To make them work for arrows in water instead, change 0.99 with 0.6 and 100 with 2.5.

### Damage
The damage an arrow inflicts on an entity depends on the damage NBT tag, the crit NBT tag, and the arrow's speed.

The damage NBT tag is determined by the item that shot it: It is 2 for everything except bows enchanted with Power, in which case it's 2.5+power level2.

The crit NBT tag is given to all arrows shot out of crossbows or fully charged bows.

The damage inflicted on an entity is damage NBT tag ⋅ speed, rounded up to a whole number. If the arrow has the crit NBT tag, it does an random amount of additional damage between 0 and damage2+2.

### Common properties

  

This section needs to be rewritten. [discuss]
It may contain inappropriate or inaccurate information. Please help us by rewriting it.


Arrows shot from a bow with the Flame enchantment, or shot through lava or fire, catch on fire and show an appropriate animation until they pass through water. They can set other entities they hit on fire for up to 5 seconds (inflicting up to 4 of fire damage)[citation needed], as well as ignite TNT, candles, and campfires.

An arrow shot in a tree
Arrows also stick into blocks they come in contact with and remain there for one minute before disappearing. Such arrows may be retrieved. The 1-minute despawn timer is then refreshed, meaning it takes another minute for the arrow to despawn.

Arrows can get visually stuck in players in Java Edition, although not any mobs. They appear as regular arrows regardless of type.[2]

- Alex covered in arrows

If the arrow has any custom potion effects (NBT tag CustomPotionEffects), all potion effects, including vanilla potion effects (NBT tag Potion) are removed 30 seconds after the arrow stops moving.

An arrow shot at a chorus flower or decorated pot breaks the block; a chorus flower drops itself, while a decorated pot shatters into pottery sherds and/or bricks along with dropping any of the items stored inside.

#### Redstone circuits
An arrow can activate a wooden button, wooden pressure plate, a tripwire, or a target. An arrow continues to power these blocks until it is removed, either due to despawning, or being picked up. Target blocks emit a redstone pulse for one second, as opposed to the static depressed state of the other switches. Non-wooden switches are not affected by arrows.

Arrows have entity data that define various properties of the entity.

	- Color: Used by the arrow entity, for displaying the custom potion color of a fired arrow item that had aCustomPotionColortag.  The numeric color code are calculated from the Red, Green and Blue components using this formula:Red<<16 + Green<<8 + Blue. For positive values larger than 0x00FFFFFF, the top byte is ignored. All negative values remove the particles.
