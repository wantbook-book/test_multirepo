# Dimension
Dimensions are accessible realms within a Minecraft world characterized by a way of generation, biomes and structures, and other things unique to one dimension. Players can explore and discover various dimensions in Minecraft, typically through the use of portals. With the addition of data packs, players can make custom dimensions to explore in Minecraft.‌[Java Edition  only]

The daylight cycle and weather may work differently or not exist in different dimensions, as well as respawn points (such as beds and respawn anchors).

## Overworld

## The Nether

The Nether is a dimension containing oceans of lava. The ground consists of mainly netherrack and is typically considered the underworld of the game. Entering a nether portal from the Overworld transports the player to this dimension.

Unique features of the Nether include:

- Chaotic, messy, dangerous, cave-like terrain.

The End is a space-like dimension with floating end stone islands, accessible with an end portal in a stronghold. It is typically considered the opposite of the Nether. The End is a barren environment, but it is the only place where some of the most unique and useful items in the game can be obtained, such as the elytra or shulker boxes.

Unique features of the End include:

- Almost no bedrock.
- Direct access to thevoid.

This section needs expansion. 
You can help by expanding it.


In joke snapshot 20w14∞, about 2.1 billion (2^31) dimensions were added. These only existed in 20w14∞ and these changes were not kept in later snapshots. There were also several easter egg dimensions, each having their own unique feature, including the ant dimension, the sponge dimension, the library dimension, the bridges dimension, the isolation dimension, the slime dimension, and the skygrid dimension. The other dimensions were completely random.

In 23w13a or b, there is a dimension called the Moon. The Moon dimension is primarily made of cheese and features a mob called the moon cow. The Moon also features lunar bases which expand into a network of copper spleaves when activated.
