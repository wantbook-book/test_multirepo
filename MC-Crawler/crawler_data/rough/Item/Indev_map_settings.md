### Level type
The level type refers to the general format the level generator used to create maps. It dramatically affected gameplay, such as the availability of water, sand and gravel. The further the player traveled toward the end of the map, the slower they moved. 

There were four kinds of map types:

- "Island" was the default level type featuring minor hills and liquid existing at the borders.
- "Floating" was similar to the floating islands in the "Buffet" world type today — it contained multiple floating islands. Falling from these islands resulted in death as the surface was covered in bedrock. Floating gravel and sand was common, while water was rare.
- "Flat" was similar to the "Superflat" world type today — it featured flat grass with flowers, trees and a starting house.
- "Inland" featured a slightly hilly landscape, which was essentially the "Island" level type with infinite flat land at its borders as opposed to water. Sand and gravel were common.

### Level shape and size
The level shape refers to the general dimensions the level generator used to create maps. It was added in Indev 0.31 20100106 and it altered the length, width, and height of the map.

There were three kinds of shapes:

- "Square" was a map of equal length and width, with a height of 64 blocks.
- "Long" was 2 times the length and1⁄2times the width of a square map.
- "Deep" was 4 times the height and1⁄2times the width and length of a square map.

There were three kinds of sizes:

|        | Square     | Long        | Deep        |
|--------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Small  | 128×128×64 | 256×64×64   | 64×64×256   |
| Normal | 256×256×64 | 512×128×64  | 128×128×256 |
| Huge   | 512×512×64 | 1024×256×64 | 256×256×256 |

### Level themes
The level theme refers to the general style the level generator used to create maps. It dramatically affected game mechanics, such as monster spawn zones and boundary liquid. These themes were comparable to biomes in Alpha, Beta and current Minecraft versions.

#### Normal
"Normal" was the default level theme. Above ground, one would find sporadic trees and generally favorable space. The weather was constantly partly cloudy, and the lengths of night and day were equal. Underground, ores of all types could be found and lava was generally found near the bedrock layer. The boundary liquid was water.

#### Hell
"Hell" was the second level theme introduced within the map theme feature. Hell featured significantly less lighting during the day, where mobs of all types would spawn at any time. All water was replaced with lava, grass was replaced with dirt and grass would spawn in place of sand only during map generation. Mushrooms were abundant on the surface. Farming worked at a much slower rate (one plant stage per day cycle). This level theme was comparable to the later added Nether. The boundary liquid was lava.

#### Paradise
The third level theme, "Paradise", was more relaxed than the other themes. It featured larger beaches and plentiful flora compared to the "Normal" theme, and the time is always set to "Noon" (the sun never sets); hostile mobs spawn only underground. Farming works at a much faster rate (from planting to harvestable in 30–45 minutes). The boundary liquid was water.

#### Woods
The fourth level theme, "Woods", was a middle-ground of challenge between "Normal" and "Hell". It provided constant overcast during the day that reduces light, and tree density was higher than the other themes, resulting in the land space becoming smaller. Additionally, mushrooms were spotty throughout the above-ground areas. The boundary liquid was water.
