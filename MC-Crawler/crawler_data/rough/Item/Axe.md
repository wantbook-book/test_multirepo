### Upgrading
Like other diamond tools, a diamond axe can be upgraded to a netherite axe, increasing its durability and slightly increasing its mining speed and attack damage, as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item.

An axe can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the axe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two axes of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the axe's enchantments.

### Chest loot
In Java Edition, a sealed room in woodland mansions can appear that has a chest always containing an Efficiency I iron axe.

### Mob loot
#### Equipment
Main article: Drops § Equipped items
A vindicator spawns with an iron axe and has an 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II, and 11.5% with Looting III) of dropping it upon death by the player. It is usually heavily damaged and is sometimes enchanted.

A piglin brute spawns with a golden axe and has an 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II, and 11.5% with Looting III) of dropping it upon death by the player. Also, in Java Edition, zombified piglins can drop their golden axe (with the same chance as piglin brute drop) if they have been zombified from a piglin brute.

#### Raids
In Bedrock Edition, Vindicator and pillagers that spawn in raids have a 4.1% chance (5.12% on hard) to drop a badly-damaged iron axe, which is sometimes enchanted with a random enchantment. A vindicator can drop 2 iron axes, one from natural equipment and one from raid drops.

### Trading
Novice-level Toolsmith villagers have a 25% chance to sell a stone axe for one emerald, journeyman-level Toolsmith villagers have a 25% chance to sell an enchanted iron axe for eight emeralds, and expert-level Toolsmith villagers have a 50% chance to sell an enchanted diamond axe for 13 emeralds.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

Novice-level Toolsmith villagers have a 40% chance to sell a stone axe for one emerald, journeyman-level Toolsmith villagers have a 40% chance to sell an enchanted iron axe for 7-22 emeralds, and expert-level Toolsmith villagers have a 66.67% chance to sell an enchanted diamond axe for 18-35 emeralds.‌[Java Edition  only]

Novice-level Weaponsmith villagers sell an iron axe for 3 emeralds as one of their trades, and master-level Weaponsmith villagers sell an enchanted diamond axe for 12 emeralds.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

Novice-level Weaponsmith villagers have a 66.67% chance to sell an iron axe for 3 emeralds. Master-level Weaponsmith villagers always offer to sell an enchanted diamond axe for 18-35 emeralds.‌[Java Edition  only]

The enchantments are the same as the ones obtained from an enchantment table at levels 5–19.

## Usage
### Chopping
An axe is used to break logs, blocks derived from wood and some other blocks faster than by using other tools. An axe uses 1 durability to break 1 block. For blocks that break instantly, it uses 0 durability.

#### Durability
Each tier of axe has a different durability:

| Material  | Durability |
|-----------|------------|
| Wood      | 59         |
| Stone     | 131        |
| Iron      | 250        |
| Diamond   | 1561       |
| Golden    | 32         |
| Netherite | 2031       |

#### Speed
The following table summarizes the speed at which axes of different qualities perform.

1. ↑Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

### Stripping
Using an axe on a log, wood block, block of bamboo, or block of copper causes it to become a stripped log, stripped wood block, block of stripped bamboo, or removes one layer of oxidization or wax, respectively. This consumes one point of durability from the axe.

### Weapon
An axe loses 2 points of durability when used as a weapon. Attacking a shielding player with an axe disables the use of all of their shields for 5 seconds. Vindicators, piglin brutes, and other axe-wielding mob can also disable a shielding player's shield.

#### Java Edition
Damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a sword of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to recover, resulting in lower DPS (with the exception of golden axes). The damage dealt and cooldown time depends on the type:

| Material  | Attack Damage | Attack Speed | Recovery time                 | DPS  | Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1] |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------------------------|------|-----------------------------------|
| Wooden    | 7             | 0.8          | 1.25 seconds (25game ticks)   | 5.6  | 210× 105                          |
| Gold      | 7             | 1.0          | 1 second (20game ticks)       | 7.0  | 112× 56                           |
| Stone     | 9             | 0.8          | 1.25 seconds (25game ticks)   | 7.2  | 594× 297                          |
| Iron      | 9             | 0.9          | 1.11 seconds (22.2game ticks) | 8.1  | 1125× 562.5                       |
| Diamond   | 9             | 1.0          | 1 second (20game ticks)       | 9.0  | 7029× 3514.5                      |
| Netherite | 10            | 1.0          | 1 second (20game ticks)       | 10.0 | 10160× 5080                       |

1. ↑The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because axes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.

#### Bedrock Edition
In Bedrock Edition, axes always attack instantly and deal 1 less damage than a sword of the same quality.

| Material  | Damage |
|-----------|--------|
| Wooden    | 4      |
| Golden    |        |
| Stone     | 5      |
| Iron      | 6      |
| Diamond   | 7      |
| Netherite | 8      |

### Enchantments
An axe can receive the following enchantments:

| Name                                              | Description                                                                                    | Max Level | Method                                           | Weight |
