# Armor
Armor is a category of items that provide players and certain mobs with varying levels of protection from common damage types, and appear graphically on the wearer (excluding non-humanoid wearers). These items include several different tiers of helmets, chestplates, leggings, and boots, which can each be placed in designated armor slots of a player's inventory for use.

## Obtaining
### Crafting
A full set of leather, iron, golden, or diamond armor consists of 24 units of a given material. A turtle shell is a helmet with no corresponding armor pieces. Despite there being chain items, chainmail armor cannot be crafted.

### Upgrading
Obtaining netherite armor requires combining a diamond armor piece with a netherite ingot and a netherite upgrade smithing template using a smithing table. A full suit of netherite armor needs 4 netherite upgrade smithing templates and 4 netherite ingots (16 netherite scraps and 16 gold ingots).

While upgrading, the newly crafted netherite armor retains the enchantments, prior work penalty and number of durability points lost (instead of the remaining durability) from the diamond armor.

### Natural generation
Two armor stands are found in each taiga village outdoor armory, one equipped with an iron helmet, the other with an iron chestplate.

### Chest loot
In Bedrock Edition, a sealed room in woodland mansions can appear that has a chest always containing an armor piece enchanted with Efficiency I.[1] The piece is either leather boots if the "Update 1.21" experimental toggle is disabled,‌[until BE 1.21.0] a chainmail chestplate if the toggle is enabled,‌[until BE 1.21.0] or chainmail leggings ‌in Bedrock Edition 1.21.0‌[upcoming].

### Mob loot
Zombies, skeletons, and their variants that spawn with armor have a small chance of dropping their armor when killed by the player. When killed, the armor they drop can vary from 0 to full durability. Upon death, zombies, zombie villagers, skeletons, zombified piglins, and wither skeletons always drop any armor that they picked up and equipped. They may also be wearing enchanted armor that retains the enchantment when dropped.

Rarely, a mob can drop a chainmail armor item. This is the only other way to obtain chainmail armor besides finding it in buried treasure or trading with villagers.

In Bedrock Edition, pillagers and vindicators that spawn in raids have a small chance to drop an iron helmet, iron chestplate, iron leggings, or iron boots, in a badly damaged state, with a possibility of having a random enchantment.

In Java Edition, armorer villagers throw chainmail armor to players who have the Hero of the Village status effect.

### Trading
Leather armor can be bought from leatherworker villagers. These armor pieces have randomly determined color.

Iron armor, chainmail armor and enchanted diamond armor can be bought from armorer villagers.

### Bartering
Piglins may barter iron boots enchanted with Soul Speed when given a gold ingot.

### Fishing
Leather boots, often badly damaged, can be obtained as a junk item from fishing.

## Armor modification
Once an armor piece has been obtained, it can be modified in a number of ways.

### Trimming
Armor can be trimmed with an armor trim and an ingot or crystal. Trimming changes the visual appearance of armor.

| Ingredients                                        | Smithing recipe |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Any Armor Trim +Any Armor Piece +Any Ingot/Crystal | Upgrade Gear    |

### Repairing
Armor can be repaired by placing two pieces of the same type (e.g., iron helmets) in a grindstone or in the crafting grid. The resulting item has 5% more durability left than the original items combined, but any enchantments are lost. If the total durability of both of the armor pieces is more than the total durability that a piece of armor would have fresh from a crafting table, the extra durability is lost. Repairing armor with an anvil preserves and combines the enchantments, with a rising experience cost for subsequent repairs on the same item.

#### Grinding
| Ingredients               | Grinding recipe | Description                                                                          |
|---------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Two matching armor pieces |                 | Thedurabilityof the two armor pieces is added together, plus an extra 5% durability. |

#### Unit repair
Main article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair
A piece of armor can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the armor material's repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% of the armor item's maximum durability, rounded down. Chainmail armor can be repaired in an anvil using iron ingots. Netherite armor can be repaired in an anvil using netherite ingots.

## Protection value
Armor points count for less as the attack strength increases: each 2 done by the attack reduces the effective defense points by 1 (), but not below 20% of the armor points. In short, the stronger the attack force, the less the armor points protect the player.

- Minimum: the lowest percentage that the full set protects from a strong attack. Each point just protects 0.8%.
- Maximum: the highest percentage each tier protects.
- Protection: the fourth level adds 16 percent of protection to the final calculation.
- Increased toughness means less armor defense point reduction from strong attacks.

More information on this can be seen in § Mechanics below.

| Full sets | Minimum | Older versions and current maximum |
|-----------|---------|------------------------------------|
| Leather   | 5.6%    | 28%                                |
| Golden    | 8.8%    | 44%                                |
| Chainmail | 9.6%    | 48%                                |
| Iron      | 12%     | 60%                                |
| Diamond   | 16%     | 80%                                |
| Netherite | 16%     | 80%                                |

## Usage
To have any protective effect, armor must be worn by the player. A helmet, chestplate, leggings, and boots are equipped by placing them in the  head,  chest,  legs and  feet slots of the inventory next to the player's character, respectively. Armor can also be equipped by right clicking while held. If the respective slot already contains a piece of armor, they are swapped, and the original armor ends up in the player's hand.

A chestplate provides the most protection per unit of material, followed by leggings. For leather, iron, and diamond armor, boots have equivalent armor points as the helmet, but for chainmail and gold armor, the helmet trumps boots. A turtle shell, in addition to providing protection, also gives the player the Water Breathing status effect.

Each armor piece consumes one inventory slot. They cannot be stacked.

If wearing any piece of gold armor, piglins become neutral toward the player; however, piglin brutes remain hostile. If wearing any piece of leather armor, a player is immune to freezing damage and FOV change. If wearing leather boots, players may walk on powder snow. This grants the "Light as a Rabbit" achievement.  

### Tiers
Main article: Armor materials
There are seven different types of materials of armor, including turtle shells. The six full sets are shown below in order from weakest (offers the least protection and is the least durable) to strongest (offers the most protection and is the most durable).

- Leather (on Steve)
- Golden (on Steve)
- Chainmail (on Steve)
- Iron (on Steve)
- Diamond (on Steve)
- Netherite (on Steve)

- Leather (on Alex)
- Golden (on Alex)
- Chainmail (on Alex)
- Iron (on Alex)
- Diamond (on Alex)
- Netherite (on Alex)

#### Other
Certain items provide beneficial effects when worn, but provide no protection against damage.

A carved pumpkin can be worn in the helmet slot. It partially blocks the player's vision, but prevents endermen from becoming aggressive when the player looks at them.

Mob heads can be worn in the helmet slot. They cut a player's detection range by 50% for the corresponding mob type ‌[JE  only], a bonus that stacks with potions of Invisibility and sneaking.

Elytra are worn in the chestplate slot, allowing the wearer to glide through the air.

The Turtle Shell is not part of a full set. However, its defense points match gold, chainmail, and iron helmets, while its durability is between iron and diamond helmets (276). Additionally, it gives the player water breathing when worn. In the game's code, its protection is equivalent to iron armor.

### Dyeing leather armor
Main article: Dye § Dyeing armor
Leather armor can be dyed by combining it with dye(s) through crafting‌[JE  only] or by using it on a cauldron containing dyed water.‌[BE  only] Using leather armor on a cauldron containing ordinary water removes any dye from it.

Default color HEX code for leather armor is  #A06540.

### Armor trims
A display of all sixteen armor trims and ten colors on netherite armor.
Main article: Smithing § Trimming
Armor can be given trims using an armor trim smithing template, a trim material and any armor piece. Trimmed armor has different patterns and different colors depending on the template and material used.

### Smelting ingredient
| Name        | Ingredients                                         | Smelting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Iron Nugget | Anyiron armoror<br/>Anychainmail armor+<br/>Anyfuel | 0.1             |
| Gold Nugget | Anygolden armor+<br/>Anyfuel                        | 0.1             |

## Mechanics
Whenever a piece of armor absorbs damage for the player, the armor itself is damaged, reducing its durability. After taking enough damage, the armor piece is completely destroyed.

Note that if the damage is absorbed not by the armor itself, but by a protection enchantment of the armor, the armor is not damaged. Enchantments can also reduce the damage that armor normally does not reduce.

### Damage types
The following types of damage are reduced by armor and, consequently, damage the armor itself:

- Direct (melee) attacks frommobsandplayers. This includes theStrengthand theWeaknesseffects and damage-increasing enchantments.
- Getting hit with anarrow, ashulker bulletor a throwntrident. This includes extra damage from enchantments (except shulker bullets).
- Getting hit with afireballfrom aghastorblaze, or afire charge.
- Laser beam of aguardianor anelder guardian.
- Damage fromThornsenchantment, or spikes ofguardiansandelder guardians.
- Touching a damaging block (fire,lava,magma block,cactusorsweet berry bush).
	- This excludes netherite armor which is not damaged by fire-related sources.
- Touching apufferfish.
- Explosions.
- Fireworkswith at least afirework starin the recipe.
- Lightning.
- Getting hit with a fallinganvil.
- Getting hit with asnowballfrom aplayer‌[upcoming: JE Combat Tests]orsnow golem.[more information needed]
- Getting hit with aneggfrom aplayer‌[upcoming: JE Combat Tests][more information needed]

The following types of damage are not reduced by armor and have no effect on the armor itself:

- Ranged sonic attacks fromwardens.
- Fall damage (includingender pearls, butProtectionandFeather Fallingenchantments reduce it).
- Ongoing damage from being onfire.
- Suffocatinginside a block or due toentity cramming(also includes theworld border)‌[JE  only].
- Drowningin water (partially forturtle shells).
- Starvation.
- Colliding with a block while flying withelytra.
- 
- Magic (Evokerfangs,status effectsandinstant damagefrom apotion of HarmingorDragon's Breath) (butProtectiondoes reduce magical damage.)
- Falling into thevoidor/kill.
- Being inside of apowder snowblock.
	- This excludes if the player or mob wears any piece of leather armor.

### Defense points



The armor bar as shown in game


Armor defense points are controlled by an attribute, generic.armor. The player's current protection level is represented visually by the armor bar. The armor meter is affected by the particular pieces that are worn as well as the tier of the armor. The following table shows the number of defense points added by default by each individual piece of armor, as well as the total points added by a full set of armor for each material. 

| Material     | Full set   | Helmet / Cap | Chestplate / Tunic | Leggings / Pants | Boots |
|--------------|------------|--------------|--------------------|------------------|-------|
| Turtle Shell | 2 ()       | 2 ()         | N/A                | N/A              | N/A   |
| Leather      | 7 ()       | 1 ()         | 3 ()               | 2 ()             | 1 ()  |
| Golden       | 11 (× 5.5) | 2 ()         | 5 ()               | 3 ()             | 1 ()  |
| Chainmail    | 12 (× 6)   | 2 ()         | 5 ()               | 4 ()             | 1 ()  |
| Iron         | 15 (× 7.5) | 2 ()         | 6 ()               | 5 ()             | 2 ()  |
| Diamond      | 20 (× 10)  | 3 ()         | 8 ()               | 6 ()             | 3 ()  |
| Netherite    | 20 (× 10)  | 3 ()         | 8 ()               | 6 ()             | 3 ()  |

Different combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.

### Armor toughness
Armor can further protect the player through a second attribute, generic.armor_toughness. Normally, armor nullifies a lesser portion of damage from attacks that deal greater damage.[2] Armor toughness resists this effect, mitigating the power of strong attacks.[3] By default, only diamond and netherite armor provide toughness, with each piece granting +2 toughness for diamond and +3 for netherite.

Different combinations of armor provide different levels of armor toughness.

Armor toughness system includes a new formula for calculating damage:

totalDamage=damage×(1−max(defensePoints5,defensePoints−4×damagetoughness+8)25)
### Damage protection
See also: Armor/Old

Damage taken depends on the number of defense points, the toughness of the armor worn and the strength of the attack. 

damage=weapondamage×(1−min⁡(20,max⁡(defensepoints5,defensepoints−4×weapondamagetoughness+8))25)
(Note: the min and max operators mean that only the minimum or maximum output of the two expressions that follow them (separated by commas) is used. for example, "y = min (2x, 16)" means that "y" is equal to the smallest value out of "2x" and "16", while the largest is ignored.)

Broken down, this means that each armor point gives 4% maximum damage reduction against an incoming attack. Without toughness, this max damage reduction is lessened by 2 percentage points for each hit point of the incoming attack. 2 defense points are worth 8% protection, so the total protection that can be achieved with armor is 80%. Diamond and netherite armors protect the player from up to 80% of damage, iron provides up to 60% damage reduction and leather provides up to 28%.

One piece of diamond armor (granting +2 toughness) decreases the defense reduction value for each attack hit point to 1.6%. Two diamond pieces decrease it to 4⁄3% (about 1.3333%), three decrease it to 8⁄7% (about 1.1428%), and four decrease it to 1%. Netherite armor decreases this even further. One piece of netherite armor reduce the defense reduction value for every hit point to 16⁄11 (about 1.4545%), two decrease it to 8⁄7 (about 1.1428%), three decrease to 16⁄17 (about 0.9412%) and four decrease it to 0.8%. The exact formula for the defense reduction in percent is:

defensereductioninpercent=16×damagetoughness+8
Simply put, as toughness increases, the amount of defense reduction done by high-damaging attacks is diminished, and as toughness approaches a high value (through commands), the defense reduction caused by high-damaging attacks becomes negligible. The final damage reduction value of the armor is capped at a minimum of 0.8% damage reduction per armor point, and to a maximum of 80% total. If armor is cheated in so that the min cap is larger than the max cap, the min cap is ignored. An illustration of the armor reduction is given below.

 

In tabular form (with a toughness of 0), damages are:

| Armor | Attack damage |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |

Note that these damage values are lower if a player wears pieces of diamond armor or has toughness added to the armor through commands. Without using cheats, armor values of 16 and above are impossible to obtain without at least one piece of diamond or netherite armor.

### Knockback reduction
Each netherite armor piece gives a knockback resistance (or reduction) of 10%, protecting 40% of all knockback with a full set.

### Enchantments
See also: Enchanting

Armor can be enchanted to provide various enchantments. Enchantments can provide more protection or allow armor to protect certain types of damage that armor doesn't normally protect against, such as fall damage or fire. Damage reduction from enchantments does not decrease the armor's durability. Armor enchantments do not appear on the armor bar.

An armor's material determines how enchantable it is. The higher a material's enchantability, the greater the chances of getting multiple and high-level enchantments (see enchantment mechanics for details).

| Leather | Golden | Chainmail | Iron | Turtle Shell | Diamond | Netherite |
|---------|--------|-----------|------|--------------|---------|-----------|
| 15      | 25     | 12        | 9    | 9            | 10      | 15        |

As with several enchantments, several different levels of protection are possible. The maximum level of a protection enchantment is currently IV (4). Protection enchantments from multiple pieces of armor stack together, up to a calculated maximum.

Each protection enchantment protects against specific types of damage. The amount of damage reduction depends on the Enchantment Protection Factor (EPF) provided by that enchantment.

| Enchantment           | Damage reduced for                            | Type Modifier | EPFLevel I | EPFLevel II | EPFLevel III | EPFLevel IV |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Protection            | All                                           | 1             | 1          | 2           | 3            | 4           |
| Fire Protection       | Fire,lava, andblazefireballs                  | 2             | 2          | 4           | 6            | 8           |
| Blast Protection      | Explosions                                    | 2             | 2          | 4           | 6            | 8           |
| Projectile Protection | Arrows, throwntridents,ghastandblazefireballs | 2             | 2          | 4           | 6            | 8           |
| Feather Falling       | Fall damage (includingender pearls)           | 3             | 3          | 6           | 9            | 12          |

When a player or mob wearing armor is subjected to damage, the EPFs of all applicable enchantments are added together, capped at 20, and then damage reduction is cappedEPF / 25, giving a maximum reduction of 20⁄25 (80%) at EPF 20. 

Because of the caps in the calculation, it is possible to achieve maximum protection against specific types of damage with just three pieces of armor. For example, two pieces of armor with Blast Protection IV (EPF 8 each) and a single piece with Protection IV (EPF 4) would give a total EPF of 20 versus explosions. Any additional EPF would be wasted against explosions (but might be useful against other types of damage, if applicable).

If the damage is of a type that armor protects against normally, this reduction applies only to the damage that got through the armor. 

It is possible using /give to obtain armor with an enchantment level higher than what is normally obtainable via normal survival. Using this method, a player could give themselves, for example, a full set of diamond armor with a Protection V enchantment on every piece. Following the algorithm above, we find that, because Protection V has an EPF of 5, the armor reaches the maximum EPF of 20 for all types of damage. Any higher Protection enchantments could be used to reach the cap with just one level XX (20) enchantment, rather than having a full set of enchanted armor, but would be wasted if all pieces shared the same level enchantment.

The table below shows all armor enchantments at their max levels:

| Armor Enchantment     | Max Level |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| Protection            | IV        |
| Fire Protection       |           |
| Blast Protection      |           |
| Projectile Protection |           |
| Feather Falling       |           |
| Respiration           | III       |
| Thorns                |           |
| Depth Strider         |           |
| Unbreaking            |           |
| Soul Speed            |           |
| Swift Sneak           |           |
| Frost Walker          | II        |
| Aqua Affinity         | I         |
| Mending               |           |
| Curse of Binding      |           |
| Curse of Vanishing    |           |

Note: Only one form of protection can be applied to a piece of armor (i.e. a chestplate cannot have both Fire Protection and Blast Protection, unless using commands to get all protection enchants in one piece of armor). Feather Falling, Frost Walker, Depth Strider and Soul Speed are enchantments applicable only to boots. Respiration and Aqua Affinity are enchantments applicable only to helmets. Swift Sneak is enchantment applicable only to leggings.

### Durability
Any hit from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). The following chart displays how many hits each piece of armor can endure.

| Material     | Helmet | Chestplate | Leggings | Boots |
|--------------|--------|------------|----------|-------|
| Turtle Shell | 275    | N/A        | N/A      | N/A   |
| Leather      | 55     | 80         | 75       | 65    |
| Golden       | 77     | 112        | 105      | 91    |
| Chainmail    | 165    | 240        | 225      | 195   |
| Iron         | 165    | 240        | 225      | 195   |
| Diamond      | 363    | 528        | 495      | 429   |
| Netherite    | 407    | 592        | 555      | 481   |

The chart below shows the durability per unit of material for each piece of armor, compared to that of the boots. Note that the durability per unit does not depend on the tier of the armor.

|                 | Helmet | Chestplate | Leggings | Boots |
|-----------------|--------|------------|----------|-------|
| Durability/Unit | 68%    | 61%        | 66%      | 100%  |

This means that for the same number of leather/iron ingots/gold ingots/chainmail/diamond, boots can take 1.5 more damage than leggings. Thus, chestplates and leggings offer more defense points per unit, but have less durability per unit.

Armor worn by a non-player mob does not lose durability when attacked by any means. Helmets that are worn by undead mobs lose durability when exposed to sunlight due to absorbing the mob's damage from sunlight.

Netherite armor does not lose durability from lava or fire damage.

## Mob armor
### Mobs equipping armor
Certain mobs can spawn equipped with random armor pieces. Some mobs also spawn with the ability to pick up the armor on the ground and equip them. The probability of mobs spawning equipped with armor, whether the armor is enchanted, the level of the enchantment of the armor, and how many pieces of armor a mob spawns with depends on the difficulty; if a mob spawns with armor, the tier of armor (leather, gold, etc.) has a fixed probability:

| Armor Type | Chance |
|------------|--------|
| Leather    | 37.06% |
| Gold       | 48.73% |
| Chainmail  | 12.90% |
| Iron       | 1.27%  |
| Diamond    | 0.04%  |

It is impossible for zombies and skeletons to naturally spawn with netherite armor.

The protection provided by armor and armor enchantments works the same with mobs as it does with players.

The following mobs can spawn with armor:

- Zombie
	- Baby Zombie
	- Zombie Villager‌[JE  only]
		- Baby Zombie Villager‌[JE  only]
	- Husk
		- Baby Husk
- Skeleton
	- Stray
- Piglin[4]

The following do not naturally spawn with armor, but they do pick up dropped armor on normal or hard difficulty:

- Drowned
	- Baby Drowned
- Zombified Piglin
	- Baby Zombified Piglin
- Wither Skeleton
- Zombie Villager‌[BE  only]
	- Baby Zombie Villager‌[BE  only]

The following do not naturally spawn with armor, but they do pick up dropped armor and their armor does not render:

- Fox‌[BE  only]
	- Baby Fox‌[BE  only]

These mobs can have armor equipped on them via dispensers, but do not pick up armor:

- Piglin Brute

These mobs can have armor equipped on them via dispensers, but their armor does not render:

- Villager
	- Baby Villager

These mobs cannot wear armor through survival mode means, but if equipped with commands, their armor is visible:

- Giant‌[Java Edition  only]
- Pillager‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
- Vindicator‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
- Evoker‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

All other mobs can be equipped via commands, although the armor cannot be seen.
Helmets can protect mobs from burning in sunlight, depleting its durability as it absorbs the damage. Eventually, the helmet loses all of its durability and breaks. Pumpkins, mob heads, or anything placed into the head slot using commands, also protect mobs from burning in sunlight.
Damage caused by any other source does not cause the mob's armor durability to decrease.

- Leather (on a zombie, or giant)
- Golden (on a zombie)
- Chainmail (on a zombie)
- Iron (on a zombie)
- Diamond (on a zombie)
- Netherite (on a zombie)

- Leather (on a skeleton)
- Golden (on a skeleton)
- Chainmail (on a skeleton)
- Iron (on a skeleton)
- Diamond (on a skeleton)
- Netherite (on a skeleton)
- A skeleton spawned by skeleton trap horse, with enchanted iron helmet and bow.
