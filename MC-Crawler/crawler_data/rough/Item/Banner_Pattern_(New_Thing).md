# Java Edition 23w13a_or_b
23w13a_or_b is an April Fools' joke snapshot, supposedly the first and only snapshot for the "Vote Update", released on April 1, 2023,[1] which, as the primary focus, adds a system where players vote for gameplay features or mechanics to be implemented. This snapshot is a fork of 23w13a.

The snapshot was reuploaded about three hours after the release,[2] to fix some crashes related to transformations and to remove inappropriate color names.

The percentage shown in the proposal is this value multiplied by 100 and rounded. For example, if the value is 1.28, knockback is multiplied by 128%. The visible percentage will always be an integer from -2147483648 to 2147483647, even if this value is outside these bounds. When using`/vote`, setting the value to 1 repeals this rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Values higher than 3 will further increase the Moon's size and attraction force, despite the proposal text being the same as when the value is 3. When using /vote, setting the value to 0 ("Just the normal Moon") repeals this rule. Negative values add the rule to the approved rules list (named "rule.moon.<value>"), but have no effect on the Moon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The percentage shown in the proposal is this value multiplied by 100 and rounded. For example, if the value is 1.28, the pitch is set to 128%. The visible percentage will always be an integer from -2147483648 to 2147483647, even if this value is outside these bounds. When using`/vote`, setting the value to 1 repeals this rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

When using`/vote`, setting the value to 1 repeals this rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Only value 0 ("Super 1000") can be approved by normal votes, but since setting the value to 0 repeals this rule, normal votes cannot actually add this rule to the approved rules list. When using /vote, the value can be set to any integer from -2147483648 to 2147483647. Non-positive values have no effect on the debug screen. Negative values set the level to "Abysmal", and setting the value to 2147483647 changes it to "L0L N00B". All values in between set the level to a procedurally generated string of text, followed by the value plus 1 and then "000" appended at the end. The starting text picks a few random words out of "Super", "Hyper", "Opti", "Extra", "Extreme", "Incredible", "Beyond", "Ultra", "Atomic", "Warp", "Performance", "Realistic", "Future", "Quantum" and "Quad", and combines them together in a random order.                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

"Implementing loadshedding" has no effect on the light engine. The proposal text "Turn on light everywhere to improve light engine  performance" has two spaces between the words "engine" and "performance", probably by accident. |

** Toasts **
- Added a new toast notification that appears every few seconds when the player has not yet opened their voting screen, and a vote proposal has started. The notification title is "New proposal received!" in purple text, while the main message differs depending on how long has passed since the first notification appeared.

			- Pressvto open voting screen
