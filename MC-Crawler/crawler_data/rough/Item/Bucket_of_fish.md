## Types
There are six types of bucket of aquatic mob:

- Bucket of Axolotl
- Bucket of Cod
- Bucket of Pufferfish
- Bucket of Salmon
- Bucket of Tadpole
- Bucket of Tropical Fish

## Obtaining
A bucket of aquatic mob can be obtained by using a water bucket on an applicable mob. Once a water bucket is used, the mob is picked up along with the water source block. The mob bucket obtained corresponds to the mob picked up.

## Usage
Pressing use with a bucket of aquatic mob places a water source block, and spawns the mob back into the world, leaving an empty bucket in the player's inventory. For buckets of tropical fish, the fish and its details (color, size, name) are kept. Placing a bucket of aquatic mob in the Nether causes the same particles to appear that generate when a normal water bucket is placed in the Nether, and the fish is spawned alone. 

Mobs caught in buckets then released do not despawn, unlike mobs that spawn naturally in their aquatic environments.

If a bucket of aquatic mob is inside a dispenser, the dispenser spawns the mob and water block in front of it upon activation, leaving an empty bucket inside. Dispensers cannot pick up mobs with water buckets (the bucket is emptied).

### Naming
If a bucket of aquatic mob is named a certain name through an anvil, the mob inside display that name as if it were named with a name tag, making fish, axolotls, and tadpoles the only mobs that can exist in item form, and be named without a name tag.‌[Java Edition  only] Alternatively, if a named mob is captured with a bucket of water, the resulting mob bucket shares a name with the captured mob.‌[Java Edition  only] If a named mob is captured in Bedrock Edition, the item is called "Bucket of <Name>".

Tropical fish have assigned names depending on their color after they are caught, in Java Edition this name is displayed in smaller text under the main item name, whereas in Bedrock Edition the main item name displays "Bucket of <fish name>". Axolotls also have assigned names depending on their growth stage and color after they are caught.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
