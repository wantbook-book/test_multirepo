# Potion
Potions are bottled substances designed to inflict effects. They are created by brewing and, when drunk, give the player an effect for a certain amount of time. All potions are brewed from a water bottle, which is considered a type of potion but has no effects.

## Obtaining
### Mob loot
Witches can drop potions of Healing, Fire Resistance, Swiftness, or Water Breathing if they die while drinking that potion.

A wandering trader can drop a potion of Invisibility if killed while drinking the potion.

### Chest loot
Two Instant Health II potions can be found in the brewing stand on end ships in end cities, and one splash potion of Weakness can be found in a brewing stand in igloo basements.

In Bedrock Edition, the cauldron in a swamp hut contains a random potion. There is a 25% chance for Healing or Poison, 15% for Swiftness, 10% for Slowness, Weakness, Strength or Water Breathing, and 5% for Fire Resistance.

### Brewing
Main article: Brewing
Almost all potions are obtained by brewing.

The potion of Luck‌[JE  only] and the potion of Decay‌[BE  only] cannot be brewed. They can be obtained via commands, and are also available in the Creative inventory in their respective versions.

### Bartering
Piglins may barter a potion or a splash potion of Fire Resistance when given a gold ingot.

### Fishing
Water bottles can be fished up as junk items.

## Usage
Potions are used by pressing and holding use with the potion bottle in hand, as with all consumable items. When consumed, they bestow the corresponding status effect upon the player and return a glass bottle.

Drinking a potion while already under the effects of the same potion does not add onto the effect's duration, but simply resets it. A potion effect does not "downgrade" if a lower level is activated. For example, if a player has Regeneration II, drinking a regular potion of Regeneration does not have any effect.

Potions can only be put into cauldrons in Bedrock Edition.

### Modifiers
Main article: Brewing
Potions can be modified in five ways. 

1. Brewingglowstone dustinto certain potions enhances their level of effect.
2. Addingredstoneextends the duration of the effect.
3. Brewinggunpowderinto a potion makes it into a splash potion (area effect).
4. Addingdragon's breathto a splash potion creates alingering potion(area effect that lingers on the ground).
5. Brewing afermented spider eyeinto specific potions modifies their effect, usually inverting it, which is referred to as "corruption".

The modifications of enhancement and extension are mutually exclusive.

Enhancing most potions trades some of its duration for a bigger effect. For example, the base Regeneration works for 44 seconds whereas Regeneration II lasts for only 22 seconds but heals more per tick during that time.

Extending a potion generally makes it last 8⁄3 as long as its base potion, so a duration of 3 minutes becomes 8 minutes.

#### Corruption
The usual result of corruption is to invert the potion's effect (for example Swiftness becomes Slowness). Interestingly, corrupting Poison (continuous damage effect) creates a Potion of Harming, an instant damage effect, instead of the continuous healing effect (regeneration) one would normally expect. Corrupting a Potion of Night Vision turns it into a Potion of Invisibility rather than an inverse effect that might be something like Blindness.

Corrupting an extended or enhanced potion results in a corrupted potion with the same modifier, if it is supported by the corrupted effect. All of the "corrupted" potions except Harming can be extended, but it is the only one that can be enhanced. In Bedrock Edition, the corruption of Healing II or Poison II potions results in a potion of Harming I.

### Base potions
Base potions are potions that have no effect when the player drinks them, but are necessary as the basis for other potions.

### Uncraftable potion
In Java Edition, the uncraftable potion is a potion with no effect that is unobtainable in regular gameplay.

It is also available in splash potion and lingering potion forms, as well as for tipped arrows.

It can be obtained using the following command: /give @s minecraft:potion{Potion:"minecraft:empty"}. It is also obtained any time a potion has invalid or missing potion effect tags, and thus serves as a placeholder.

#### Java Edition 23w13a_or_b
Big is an effect that makes entities bigger. Big I multiplies the entity size by 1.5 times,[verify] while Big II multiplies it by 2 times. 

Small is an effect that makes entities smaller.

### Undead mobs
The effects given by Potions of Healing and Harming are opposite on undead mobs, which includes skeletons and zombies. Potions of Healing cause harm, and Harming heals them. In addition, undead mobs are not affected by Poison or Regeneration. 

In Bedrock Edition, hitting an undead mob with a Regeneration Potion always registers as Regeneration I, no matter the level of the used potion.

### Mud conversion
Using a water bottle, splash water bottle, or lingering water bottle on dirt, coarse dirt, or rooted dirt converts it into mud, returning a glass bottle with it. This process can be automated with a dispenser. 

### Filling cauldrons with potions
In Bedrock Edition, using a potion bottle on a cauldron empties the potion into it and fills the cauldron by 1⁄3 of its capacity. Using a glass bottle on a cauldron filled with a potion drains it by 1⁄3 and fills the bottle. A single cauldron can store up to three potions of the same type. Different potions cannot be combined in a cauldron, nor can they be mixed with any other substance. Arrows can be also tipped when used on a cauldron containing potion. A single portion of potion can tip 16 arrows at once.

## Custom effects
In Java Edition, potions can also be obtained with any status effect using /give and the tag CustomPotionEffects, which is an array of effects for the potion. See Item format#Potion Effects for more information, and status effect for a list of effects and IDs.

### Item data
#### Java Edition
- tag: The item'stagtag.

- 
	- custom_potion_effects: The custompotion effects(status effects) this potion or tipped arrow has.
		- One of these for each effect.
			- id: Theresource location of the effect.
			- amplifier: The amplifier of the effect, with level I having value 0.  Negative levels are discussedhere. Optional, and defaults to level I.
			- duration: The duration of the effect inticks.  Values 0 or lower are treated as 1.  Optional, and defaults to 1 tick.
			- ambient: 1 or 0 (true/false) - whether or not this is an effect provided by a beacon and therefore should be less intrusive on the screen. Optional, and defaults to false.
			- show_particles: 1 or 0 (true/false) - whether or not this effect produces particles. Optional, and defaults to true.
			- show_icon: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if effect icon is shown. false if no icon is shown.
	- Potion: Thename of the default potion effect. This name differs from thestatus effectname. For example, the value for an "Instant Health II" potion is "minecraft:strong_healing".  A potion or tipped arrow getting its effects from this tag is named with the proper effect. The default value is "minecraft:empty", which gives it the "Uncraftable" name.
	- CustomPotionColor: The item uses this custom color, and area-of-effect clouds, arrows, and splash and lingering potions use it for their particle effects. This color does not extend, however, to the particles given off by entities who ultimately receive the effect. The numeric color codes are equal to the hex code of the color converted to a decimal number, or can alternatively be calculated from the Red, Green and Blue components using this formula:Red<<16 + Green<<8 + Blue. For positive values larger than 0x00FFFFFF, the top byte is ignored. All negative values produce white.

Normal potions use an NBT "Potion" tag to indicate the potion type. The values of the tag (to be prefixed with minecraft:) are:

| Potion                                         | Regular                   | Level II               | Extended +             |

## Unused potions
Bedrock Edition has unused potion textures for several effects, along with their splash variants. These effects are: Absorption, Blindness, Haste, Health Boost, Hunger, Mining Fatigue, Nausea, Resistance, Saturation, and Levitation, as well as the Luck potion textures also present in Java Edition. These unused textures were added along with the other potion textures in Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha, except for the potion of Levitation, which was added in Pocket Edition 1.0.0. The textures were changed along with the other potion textures during the texture update in Bedrock Edition 1.10.0. Strangely, the potion of levitation texture is a duplicate of the splash potion of levitation texture.

- Potion of Absorption
- Potion of Blindness
- Potion of Haste
- Potion of Health Boost
- Potion of Hunger
- Potion of Mining Fatigue
- Potion of Nausea
- Potion of Resistance
- Potion of Saturation
- Potion of Levitation
