## Obtaining
### Upgrading

Like other diamond tools, a diamond hoe can be upgraded to a netherite hoe, increasing its durability and slightly increasing its mining speed, as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item.

#### Unit repair
Main article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair
A netherite hoe can be repaired in an anvil by adding netherite ingots, with each ingot restoring 25% the hoe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two netherite hoes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the hoe's enchantments.

## Usage
Main article: Hoe § Usage
### Harvesting
Hoes are used to harvest certain plant-based or organic blocks more quickly. Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 durability.

Breaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise.

### Tilling
Hoes are used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into farmland. To till, press use on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on mycelium or podzol,[1] nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including snow layers or torches. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe.

Hoes can be used to convert coarse dirt into regular dirt by pressing use on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled.

Hoes can also be used on rooted dirt, which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a hanging roots item.

Tilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block.

Hoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt.[2]

### Weapon
Hoes may be used as a weapon, although they deal only 1 damage in Java Edition. In Bedrock Edition, hoes can do as much as a pickaxe in terms of damage. Hoes use 1 durability when used as a weapon.

In Java Edition, netherite hoes have an attack speed modifier 0 (refill in 0.25s).

Hoes always attack instantly in Bedrock Edition.

### Enchantments
A hoe can receive the following enchantments:
