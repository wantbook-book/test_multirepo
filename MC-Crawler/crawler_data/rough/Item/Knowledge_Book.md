## Obtaining
Knowledge books can be obtained only by using commands, as they are not found in the creative inventory.

For example, to give oneself a knowledge book that reveals the recipes for buckets and flower pots, use: /give @s minecraft:knowledge_book{Recipes:["minecraft:bucket", "minecraft:flower_pot"]}.

## Usage
Knowledge books are used to reveal recipes to the player who uses it, by adding it to their recipe book. Using a knowledge book consumes it, removing it from the player's inventory.

Knowledge books are especially useful to mapmakers in conjunction with /gamerule doLimitedCrafting true, because then any item is craftable only if its recipe is unlocked first.
