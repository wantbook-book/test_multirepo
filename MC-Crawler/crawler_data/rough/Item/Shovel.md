### Upgrading
Like other diamond tools, a diamond shovel can be upgraded to a netherite shovel, increasing its durability and slightly increasing its mining speed and attack damage, as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item.

A shovel can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the shovel's maximum durability, rounded down. Two shovels of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the shovel's enchantments.

### Chest loot
On ancient_city/city_center/city_center_2, they generate a furnace with a wooden shovel inside of it.

1. ↑ a b c dEnchantment probabilities are the same as a level-20 to level-39 enchantment would be on an enchantment table that had no cap at level 30, and that was able to apply treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and where the chance of multiple enchantments is not reduced.

### Mob loot
#### Equipment
Main article: Drops § Equipped items
Zombies and husks have a 0.67% (3.33% in Hard difficulty) chance of spawning with an iron shovel. They have an 8.5% (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) chance of dropping that shovel if they are killed by the player. The dropped shovel is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted: 0%–25% on Normal difficulty and 3.125%–25% on Hard difficulty, varying with regional difficulty, and enchanted as if on an enchanting table at level 5–22.

#### Raids
Vindicators and pillagers that spawn from raids have a 4.1% chance(5.12% on hard) to drop a badly-damaged iron shovel that is sometimes enchanted with a random enchantment.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

### Trading
Novice-level toolsmith villagers have a 25% chance to sell stone shovels for one emerald, journeyman-level toolsmith villagers have a 25% chance to sell enchanted iron shovels for 2 emeralds, and expert-level toolsmith villagers have a 50% chance to sell enchanted diamond shovels for 5 emeralds as part of their trades.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

Novice-level toolsmith villagers have a 40% chance to sell stone shovels for one emerald, journeyman-level tool smiths have a 40% chance to sell an enchanted iron shovel for 7-22 emeralds, and expert-level tool smiths have a 2⁄3 chance to sell an enchanted diamond shovel for 11-27 emeralds.‌[Java Edition  only]

The enchantments are the same as the ones obtained from an enchanting table at levels 5–19.

### Villager gifts
in Java Edition, toolsmith villagers occasionally throw stone shovels at players with the Hero of the Village effect.

## Usage
### Digging
A shovel can be used to break soil-type materials faster. Breaking a block with a shovel consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that break instantly, like torches and flowers. Shovels have different amounts of uses based on the type:

- Wooden: 59 inJava Edition, 60 in inBedrock Edition;
- Stone: 131 inJava Edition, 132 in inBedrock Edition;
- Iron: 250 inJava Edition, 251 in inBedrock Edition;
- Golden: 32 inJava Edition, 33 in inBedrock Edition;
- Diamond: 1,561 inJava Edition, 1,562 in inBedrock Edition;
- Netherite: 2,031 inJava Edition, 2,032 in inBedrock Edition.

#### Speed
The following table summarizes the speed at which different quality shovels perform on different block types. Values with a red background indicate that no resource is dropped when the block is destroyed without a shovel.

1. ↑Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

### Dirt paths
A shovel can be used to create a dirt path by using (not digging) the shovel on any one of the following blocks, losing one durability point:

- Grass Block
- Dirt
- Coarse Dirt
- Rooted Dirt
- Podzol
- Mycelium

### Campfire
A shovel can be used to extinguish a campfire.

### Weapon
A shovel loses 2 points of durability when used as a weapon. Shovels may be used as a weapon, although due to having identical attack speeds to axes in Java Edition, but with less damage, they are strictly inferior to axes.

#### Java Edition
Shovels have an attack speed of 1 and take 1 second to recover.

| Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1] | 72.5× 36.25 | 40× 20    | 227.5× 113.75 | 562.5× 281.25 | 4292.75× 2146.375 | 6600.75× 3300.375 |

1. ↑The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because hoes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.

#### Bedrock Edition
In Bedrock Edition, shovels have no attack cooldown, and deal the following damage:

| Material                          | Wooden | Gold     | Stone   | Iron     | Diamond      | Netherite  |
|-----------------------------------|--------|----------|---------|----------|--------------|------------|

| Durability                        | 60     | 33       | 132     | 251      | 1562         | 2032       |
| Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1] | 60× 30 | 33× 16.5 | 198× 99 | 502× 251 | 3905× 1952.5 | 6096× 3048 |

### Enchantments
A shovel can receive the following enchantments:

| Name               | Description                                            | Max Level | Method                     | Weight |

| Fortune[note 2]    | Increases the amount ofdropswhen mining.               | III       | Enchanting Table<br/>Anvil | 2      |

| Curse of Vanishing | The shovel vanishes on death, not dropping as an item. | I         | Anvil                      | 1      |

The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.

### Fuel
Wooden shovels can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1 item per shovel.
