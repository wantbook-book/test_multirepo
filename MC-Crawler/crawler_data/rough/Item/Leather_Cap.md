#### Unit repair

A leather cap can be repaired in an anvil by adding leather, with each leather restoring 25% the cap's maximum durability, rounded down. Two helmets of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the cap's enchantments.

1. ↑ a bAll enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.

### Mob loot
Zombies, husks, skeletons, strays, bogged, piglins, and zombified piglins have a small chance to spawn wearing armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the helmet they're wearing upon death. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.

### Trading
In Java Edition, apprentice-level leatherworker villagers have a 2⁄3 chance to sell a leather cap[note 1] for 5 emeralds. Master-level leatherworker villagers offer the same trade.

In Bedrock Edition, apprentice-level leatherworker villagers have a 50% chance to sell leather cap for 5 emeralds as part of their trades, and 50% chance to sell an enchanted leather cap for 5 emeralds at the master level.

1. ↑The leather armor has a random color created by two dyes (possibly the same dye twice.)

## Usage
Leather caps can be placed in the top armor slot of a player's inventory for activation.

### Defense points
Defense points are each signified by half of a shirt of mail in the armor bar above the health bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.

Leather caps add 1 () defense point.

### Durability
Leather caps can absorb 55 damage before being destroyed.

Any "hit" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken that armor doesn't protect (such as falling or drowning) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits helmets can endure.

#### Repair
Leather caps may be repaired by using them along with some of leather in an anvil. They may also be repaired by crafting them together with another leather cap.

### Enchantments
A leather cap can receive the following enchantments.

### Armor trimming
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a leather cap, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, or diamond).


These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.
