## Usage
### Food
See also: Tutorials/Hunger management

To eat rotten flesh, press and hold use while rotten flesh is selected in the hotbar.

Eating rotten flesh restores 4 () hunger and 0.8 hunger saturation, but has an 80% chance of inflicting Hunger (effect) for 30 seconds. Note that the duration does not accumulate when eating multiple pieces. However, if more is consumed and the Hunger status effect is inflicted, the duration resets to 30 seconds.

### Wolves
Rotten flesh can be used to breed and heal tamed wolves, lead them around, and make baby tamed wolves grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.

Wolves are immune to the Hunger effect.

### Trading
Novice-level cleric villagers buy 32 rotten flesh for 1 emerald as part of their trades.
