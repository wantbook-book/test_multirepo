#### Unit repair
Main article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair
Repair & NameDamaged Chainmail Helmet
A chainmail helmet can be repaired in an anvil by adding iron ingots, with each ingot restoring 25% the helmet's maximum durability, rounded down. Two chainmail helmets can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the helmet's enchantments.

### Mob loot
Zombies, husks, skeletons, strays, bogged, piglins, and zombified piglins have a small chance to spawn wearing armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the helmet they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an ominous trial spawner. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.

### Trading
In Java Edition, journeyman-level armorers have a 40% chance to sell a chainmail helmet for 1 emerald.

Armorer villagers may give the players with the Hero of the Village effect a chainmail helmet.

In Bedrock Edition, journeyman-level armorer villagers have a 1⁄3 chance to sell chainmail helmet.

## Usage
Chainmail helmets can be placed in the top armor slot of a player's inventory for activation.

### Defense points
Defense points are each signified by half of a shirt of mail in the armor bar above the health bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.

Chainmail helmet add 2 () defense points.

### Durability
Chainmail helmets can absorb 165 damage before being destroyed.

Any "hit" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken that armor doesn't protect (such as falling or drowning) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits helmets can endure.

#### Repair
Chainmail helmets may be repaired by using them along with some iron ingots in an anvil. They may also be repaired by crafting them together with another chainmail helmet.

### Enchantments
A chainmail helmet can receive the following enchantments. Note that while iron and chainmail have the same durability, chainmail has a higher enchantability than iron or diamond.

### Armor trimming
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a chainmail helmet, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, or diamond).


These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.
