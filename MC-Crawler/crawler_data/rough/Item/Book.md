# Book
Books are items that play an important role for enchanting, used to craft the enchanting table itself as well as bookshelves required to power it up. Alternatively, books themselves can be enchanted in order to store and apply enchantments. A book can also be crafted into a book and quill, which allows players to write and keep text.
