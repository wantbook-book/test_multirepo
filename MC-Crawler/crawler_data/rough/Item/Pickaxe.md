# Pickaxe
A pickaxe is a tool required to mine ores, rock-based blocks and metal-based blocks quickly and obtain them as items. A pickaxe mines faster and can obtain more block types as items depending on the material it is made from.

### Upgrading
Like other diamond tools, a diamond pickaxe can be upgraded to a netherite pickaxe, increasing its durability and slightly increasing its mining speed, as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item.

#### Unit repair
Main article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair
Pickaxes can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tier's repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% of the pickaxe's maximum durability, rounded down.

1. ↑ a b c dEnchantment probabilities are the same as a level-20 to level-39 enchantment would be on an enchantment table that had no cap at level 30, and that was able to apply treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and where the chance of multiple enchantments is not reduced.
2. ↑ a b c d e fAll enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.
3. ↑ a bThe item has between 15% and 95% of its total durability.

### Mob loot
In Bedrock Edition, pillagers and vindicators have a chance of dropping a damaged iron pickaxe when killed during a raid. The pickaxe has a 50% chance of being enchanted with random enchantment(s).

### Trading
In Bedrock Edition, novice-level toolsmith villagers have a 25% chance to sell stone pickaxes for one emerald, Journeyman-level toolsmith villagers have a 25% chance to sell enchanted iron pickaxes for 3 emeralds, and master-level toolsmith villagers always sell enchanted diamond pickaxes for 13 emeralds.

In Java Edition, novice-level toolsmith villagers have a 40% chance to sell a stone pickaxe for one emerald, journeyman-level toolsmith villagers have a 40% chance to sell an enchanted iron pickaxe for 7–22 emeralds, and a master-level toolsmith always sells an enchanted diamond pickaxe for 18–35 emeralds.

The enchantments are the same as the ones obtained from an enchantment table at levels 5–19.

### Villager gifts
In Java Edition, toolsmith villagers throw stone pickaxes at players under the Hero of the Village effect.

## Usage
### Mining
A pickaxe is used to break stone-based and metal-based materials faster. Breaking a block with a pickaxe consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that break instantly, like torches and flowers. Pickaxes have different amounts of uses based on the type:

- Wooden: 59 inJava Edition, 60 inBedrock Edition;
- Stone: 131 inJava Edition, 132 inBedrock Edition;
- Iron: 250 inJava Edition, 251 inBedrock Edition;
- Golden: 32 inJava Edition, 33 inBedrock Edition;
- Diamond: 1,561 inJava Edition, 1,562 inBedrock Edition;
- Netherite: 2,031 inJava Edition, 2,032 inBedrock Edition.

Different qualities of pickaxe are required to successfully harvest certain ores and blocks. For example, while stone can be mined with any pickaxe, gold ore must be mined with an iron pickaxe, diamond pickaxe, or netherite pickaxe, or else the player harvests no ore. Different pickaxes also mine many materials at different speeds:

#### Speed
The following table shows the number of seconds required to break each type of block.

- Aredbackground indicates that the block cannot be harvested with that type of pickaxe.
- Ayellowbackground indicates that the block cannot be harvested with that type of pickaxe, but still drops something.
- Agreenbackground indicates that the block can be harvested with that type of pickaxe.

1. ↑Chemistry tables are slow to break by hand, similar to blocks that require a pickaxe to mine. However, they still drop as items.

### Weapon
A pickaxe loses 2 points of durability when used as a weapon. Pickaxes may be used as a weapon, and in Java Edition, they have an attack speed higher than that of an axe, shovel, or trident, but lower than that of a sword or mace.

#### Java Edition
Pickaxes have an attack speed of 1.2 and take 0.83 seconds to recover.

| Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1] | 59× 29.5 | 32× 16 | 196.5× 98.25 | 500× 250 | 3902.5× 1951.25 | 6093× 3046.5 |

1. ↑The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because hoes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.

#### Bedrock Edition
In Bedrock Edition, pickaxes have no attack cooldown, and deal the following damage:

| Material                          | Wooden | Gold   | Stone    | Iron       | Diamond    | Netherite  |
|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|------------|------------|------------|

| Durability                        | 60     | 33     | 132      | 251        | 1562       | 2032       |

### Enchantments
A pickaxe can receive the following enchantments:

| Name               | Description                                             | Max Level | Method                     | Weight |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------|--------|
| Efficiency         | Increases the mining speed.                             | V         | Enchanting Table<br/>Anvil | 10     |
| Fortune[note 2]    | Increases the amount ofdropswhen mining.                | III       | Enchanting Table<br/>Anvil | 2      |
| Silk Touch[note 2] | Causes blocks to drop themselves when mined.            | I         | Enchanting Table<br/>Anvil | 1      |
| Unbreaking         | Grants a chance to negate durability consumption.       | III       | Enchanting Table<br/>Anvil | 5      |
| Mending            | Repairs the pickaxe when obtainingexperience.           | I         | Anvil                      | 2      |
| Curse of Vanishing | The pickaxe vanishes on death, not dropping as an item. | I         | Anvil                      | 1      |

1. ↑The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because hoes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.
2. ↑ a bSilk Touch and Fortune are mutually exclusive

### Fuel
Wooden pickaxes can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1 item per wooden pickaxe.

### Smelting ingredient

### Piglins
Piglins are attracted to golden pickaxes and run toward any golden pickaxes on the ground, and inspect it for 6 to 8 seconds before putting it in their inventory.
