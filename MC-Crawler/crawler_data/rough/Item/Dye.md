# Dye
Dyes are a set of sixteen items used to change the color of wool, carpets, terracotta, concrete powder, glass, shulker boxes, beds, candles, the patterns on banners, firework stars, certain mobs, and text on signs and hanging signs. In Bedrock Edition they can also be used to dye water in a cauldron (which is thereafter used to dye leather armor); in Java Edition leather armor can be dyed directly. In Minecraft Education dyes can also be used to dye balloons and glow sticks.

In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, bone meal, ink sacs, lapis lazuli, and cocoa beans can generally substitute for white dye, black dye, blue dye, and brown dye, respectively, in crafting recipes and for use in dyeing items or mobs. However, they have other important uses that aren't related to color, and are therefore not considered true dyes. They are mentioned in this article only in regard to their use as dyeing agents; see their individual articles for complete information about them.

## Obtaining
Dyes can be produced by crafting them from plants (mainly flowers), by crafting dyes of different colors together, by smelting plants, or by trading with a wandering trader.

Crafting

### Smelting
| Name      | Ingredients             | Smelting recipe |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Lime Dye  | Sea Pickle+<br/>Anyfuel | 0.1             |
| Green Dye | Cactus+<br/>Anyfuel     | 1               |

### Trading
Wandering traders can sell 3 dyes for an emerald. In Bedrock Edition, they can also sell 3 lapis lazuli, bone meal, cocoa beans, or ink sacs for one emerald.

Apprentice-level cleric villagers sell one lapis lazuli per emerald.

### Other
Ink sacs can also be created using 1 iron, 1 sulfur, and 4 oxygen in the compound creator. ‌[Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education  only]

## Usage
Similar to their use in crafting, bone meal, ink sacs, lapis lazuli, and cocoa beans can be substituted for the corresponding dye in any of the following usages unless otherwise specified.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

### Dyeing wool and mobs
Wool can be dyed by placing wool and any dye in a crafting grid.

Dyes can be used on sheep to change the color of the wool. Shearing a colored sheep drops the corresponding color of the wool, and the sheep retains the color when the wool regenerates. Breeding colored sheep produces a lamb colored as one of the parent sheep, or a color resulting from the combination of both parents' color. The color combining follows the same rules that dyes use – red and yellow sheep produce an orange lamb, but a blue and yellow sheep cannot create a green lamb. The unlimited reproduction of colored sheep makes dyeing and shearing sheep infinitely more efficient than just dyeing wool directly.

Dye can also be used on a tamed wolf or cat to change the color of its collar from the default red to the color of the dye.

### Dyeing carpets
Carpets can be dyed.

### Creating concrete powder
Dyes can also be used to craft concrete powder, which can then be set into their respective concrete blocks (these cannot be dyed directly).

### Staining glass
Stained glass can be stained by placing 8 blocks of glass around a dye on a crafting table. Just like regular glass, stained glass can be crafted into stained glass panes. The recipe for this is the same as with regular glass.

### Dyeing shulker boxes
Shulker boxes are generated in a light shade of purple (like the purpur block), but can be dyed any color. They can also be re-dyed as often as desired.

Leather armor or wolf armor can be dyed by:

- Crafting dyes with a piece of leather armor, leatherhorse armoror wolf armor.‌[Java Edition  only]
- Dousing the leather armor or leather horse armor in acauldronto which dyes have been added.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

It is possible to put more than one dye alongside the leather armor. Armor can be dyed multiple times with previous colors affecting the final outcome. Colored armor can be reverted to their original color using a cauldron with undyed water.

The game has a specific formula for calculating the color of dyed armor: each color, in the RGB color model, has a red value, green value, and blue value. For each dye in the crafting grid, and the armor itself (if it is already dyed), the red, green, and blue values are added to running totals. In addition, a running total of the highest value (be it red, green, or blue) is also kept. After this, each total is divided by the number of colors used. This effectively produces the average red, green, blue, and maximum values. The maximum value of the average RGB values is also calculated. Finally, each average RGB value is multiplied by the average maximum value and divided by the maximum of the average RGB values. The modified average RGB values are then used as the final color. This procedure can be summed up with the following pseudocode:

set all "total" variables to 0
set numberOfColors to 0
for each color:
 set totalRed to: totalRed + redValue
 set totalGreen to: totalGreen + greenValue
 set totalBlue to: totalBlue + blueValue
 set totalMaximum to: totalMaximum + (max of redValue, greenValue, blueValue)
 set numberOfColors to: numberOfColors + 1

set averageRed to: totalRed / numberOfColors
set averageGreen to: totalGreen / numberOfColors
set averageBlue to: totalBlue / numberOfColors
set averageMaximum to: totalMaximum / numberOfColors

set maximumOfAverage to: max of averageRed, averageGreen, averageBlue
set gainFactor to: averageMaximum / maximumOfAverage

set resultRed to: averageRed * gainFactor
set resultGreen to: averageGreen * gainFactor
set resultBlue to: averageBlue * gainFactor

Due to the way this formula works, the resulting color can never be darker than the average of the input colors and is often lighter and more saturated. Of course, the resulting color can never be lighter or more saturated than the lightest or most saturated input color. In addition, this formula never creates an RGB value higher than 255 (which would be invalid in the 8-bit RGB color model).

If leather armor is renamed on an anvil, it retains its name when dyed or undyed.

### Dyeing firework stars
A firework star can have a single color or a combination of up to eight colors when crafted with dyes. Adding one or more dyes to a crafted firework star adds a "fade to color" effect to it, overwriting any existing fade colors.

### Dyeing water inside cauldrons
Water can be dyed in a cauldron by holding any dye in the hand and pressing use on a cauldron filled with water.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

### Signs
Dye can be used on a sign or a hanging sign to change the text color. In Bedrock Edition, ink sacs cannot be used for this purpose; black dye must be used to change the text to black.

### Trading
Apprentice, journeyman and expert-level shepherd villagers buy 12 of any of the dyes for an emerald.

## Color values
The "color codes" are used to determine the color imparted on sheep, wolf and cat collars, firework stars, beacon beams, and dyed leather armor. The hex value is shown in the extended tooltips of dyed leather armor; however, to set the color using an NBT data tag in a command, the decimal value must be used instead. The color values for firework stars are slightly different from the ones listed below, and use these values instead.
