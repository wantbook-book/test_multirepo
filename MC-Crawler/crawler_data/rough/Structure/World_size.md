# World size
World size is an option to change the size of the finite worlds in New Nintendo 3DS Edition and Legacy Console Edition (specific to Xbox One Edition, PlayStation 4 Edition,  and Nintendo Switch Edition). By default, worlds generate at the largest size available in each edition.

## Legacy Console Edition
Large world type selected in the World Options menu.
In the finite worlds of Legacy Console Edition, the edge of the Overworld is surrounded by an endless sea of water preceded by an invisible barrier. The outer two chunks of the usable world is usually a smooth transition from the main landmass/noise generation to the sea of water. The edge of the Nether is surrounded by a wall of bedrock. The End is not affected by world size. Worlds are able to generate with any of the biomes and generated structures available in the current version. The tile on each edge of the Overworld and Nether is inaccessible, so the effective area is 2 tiles less on both axes.

After a world has been created, it can be expanded to a larger size. Larger worlds cannot be reverted to a smaller size. In this process, there is an option to "Overwrite World Edges", disabled by default. The description of this option reads: "When enabled, the outer 32 tiles around the world edge are overwritten by newly generated tiles to make the world size increase seamlessly. When disabled, the world size increase will leave all original tiles intact." Starting with a smaller world used to be beneficial, as one could choose to gradually expand when an update made changes to the world generation, and could therefore generate new chunks with new features. However, since updates were later discontinued on Legacy Console Edition, this benefit no longer exists.

Xbox 360 Edition, PlayStation 3 Edition, PlayStation Vita Edition, and Wii U Edition do not have the option for world size. All worlds generated in these editions are Classic size, although it is possible to expand them if they are transferred to an edition that supports larger world sizes. More villages, ocean monuments, and woodland mansions attempt to generate in Classic than in larger-sized worlds.

| World size | Overworld area                                                         | Number of maps    | Nether area                                                   | Nether-Overworld ratio |     |     |     |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----|-----|-----|
| Classic    | 864×864 blocks: 746,496 blocks<br/>54×54 chunks: 2,916 chunks          | 1×1 map: 1 map    | 288×288 blocks: 82,944 blocks<br/>18×18 chunks: 324 chunks    | 1:3                    | Yes | Yes | Yes |

| Medium     | 3072×3072 blocks: 9,437,184 blocks<br/>192×192 chunks: 36,864 chunks   | 3×3 maps: 9 maps  | 512×512 blocks: 262,144 blocks<br/>32×32 chunks: 1,024 chunks | 1:6                    | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Large      | 5120×5120 blocks: 26,214,400 blocks<br/>320×320 chunks: 102,400 chunks | 5×5 maps: 25 maps | 640×640 blocks: 409,600 blocks<br/>40×40 chunks: 1,600 chunks | 1:8                    | Yes | Yes | No  |

The end dimension is fixed to a 192x192 block area (36,864 blocks, 8×8 chunks, 144 chunks) centered at 0,0, and one outer end island the same size 2048 blocks away from 0,0 in a cardinal direction (Total: 73,728 blocks, 288 chunks) . On Xbox One Edition, PlayStation 4 Edition, and Nintendo Switch Edition, up to four outer islands the same size can generate on all cardinal directions 2048 blocks away from 0,0 (Total: 184,320 blocks, 720 chunks).

## New Nintendo 3DS Edition
The finite worlds of the New Nintendo 3DS Edition are based on the Old world type from Bedrock Edition. The edges of both the Overworld and Nether are surrounded by an invisible barrier, and the ratio of the Nether to the Overworld is 1:3 regardless of world size. It is not possible to change the size of a world after it has been created.

Unlike Legacy Console Edition, world size limits worlds are centered at the spawnpoint of the world seed, not centered at coordinate 0,0. Biome size is the same across all world sizes, matching that of default Pocket Edition worlds, unlike Legacy Console Edition where biome size scale can be changed independently of world size. Structure placement is also the same across world sizes. 

Unlike the Nether and the Overworld, the End dimension is always centered at coordinate 0,0. This causes a invisible barrier to generate in the same location as the edge of the Overworld. In some cases, the barrier can cut through the central End island or outer End islands.

The map grid is not aligned to the world generation, unlike Legacy Console, where its maps are aligned to world size.

| World size | Overworld area/End area                                              | Number of maps | Nether area                                                   | Outer End gateway coordinates                                        |
