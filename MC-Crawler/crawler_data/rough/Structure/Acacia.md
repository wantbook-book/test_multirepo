## Appearance
Acacia trees.
The way acacias form is distinct. Acacia branches do not grow the same way as on other multi-branch trees (dark oak and giant jungle trees). Some acacias have many straight logs and a curve at the top, some at the bottom, and some curve from bottom to top. Typically, the canopy consists of just two layers of leaves, sometimes three. Acacia trees have high variability and can take many forms, such as: 

- The common acacia has a diagonal trunk and a single canopy.
- The multi-canopy acacia has a trunk which forks around the middle of the plant. Each end ends in a canopy.
- Another form of multi-canopy acacia exists where a straight trunk is topped with a small canopy, out of which grows additional trunk ending in a second, higher canopy. These trees often grow taller than the common acacia.

## Generation
Acacias spawn naturally only in the savanna biome and its variants.

## Blocks and items
These items can be obtained from all variants of acacia:

- Acacia Log(harvested with any tool including hands)
- Acacia Leaves(harvested withshears)
- Stick(chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
- Acacia Planks(created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
- Stripped Acacia Log(created byusinganaxeon a log)
- Acacia Sapling(1⁄20chance of dropping when leaves decay or are broken)

## Planting
Acacia saplings can be planted on:

- Dirt
- Grass Block
- Coarse Dirt
- Podzol
- Mycelium
- Rooted Dirt
- Moss Block
- Farmland
- Mud
- Muddy Mangrove Roots

An acacia requires a 3×3 column of unobstructed space at least 6 blocks above the sapling (7 blocks including the sapling itself). Additionally, the tree requires 5×5 layers without obstruction for the top 3 layers of its final height. No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree (a sapling planted in a hole 1 block deep can still grow).

## Foliage colors
An acacia tree split between a savanna biome and a swamp biome.
Main article: Tint
Depending on where the tree generates, the color of the leaves may differ. For example, if an acacia is in a colder biome, such as a taiga or mountains biome, it has a blue-green hue.

Leaves are checked individually for biome coloration rather than as part of a larger tree; as such, trees that were grown between biomes usually have multiple shades on each side.
