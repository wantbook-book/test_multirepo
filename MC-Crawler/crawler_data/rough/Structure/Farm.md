## Generation
Farms generate naturally in villages. All farms generate with farmland blocks, water, and at least one composter (with rare exceptions). Most farms generate with crops, mostly wheat, but melons, pumpkins, and carrots may also be found.

In addition, village farm plots have a 20% chance to generate with potatoes planted, and a 10% chance to generate with beetroot planted.

## Post-generation
See also: Farmland

A player may create a working crop farm in any biome in the Overworld or The End. A farm needs only a water source block near to farmland blocks, which are created by using a hoe on dirt blocks. Given sufficient light, seeds or other crops may then be planted on the farmland and grown to maturity for harvesting.

## Use
See also: Tutorials/Crop farming

While a village farm is a good ready-made source of food, a village is not required for farming crops. A player with access to water, dirt or grass blocks, and a hoe may create a farm anywhere.

For a typical early-game survival farm, a player uses a hoe to create farmland within four blocks of water, and then plants seeds that were harvested from breaking tall grass. The seeds eventually grow into wheat after a few day-night cycles. Once the crops have matured, they can be harvested and then used for food, trading, leading livestock, breeding livestock, or breeding villagers.

Farmer villagers use a farm's composter as a job site. Farmer villagers can also be seen occasionally harvesting crops.

## Structure
A naturally-generated tiny farm in a savanna village.
Farms generate in different configurations depending on the biome. Some farms have irregular shapes that can vary from the configurations shown below. As seen on the right, it is possible for a minimal farm to generate naturally with one water block and eight farmland blocks.

As shown in the sections below, additional resources that make up the structure are available beyond the farmland, water, and composter blocks found in all farms.

### Desert
There are three variants of farms found in desert villages:

- Three patches of farmland divided by two irrigation canals and a composter.
- Farmland with an offset composter surrounded by jungle trapdoors.
- Large farm surrounded by hay bales, two composters, and a water channel made of smooth sandstone.

** Crops **
- Carrot
- Wheat

** Additional resources available **
- Cut Sandstone
- Hay Bale
- Jungle Trapdoor
- Smooth Sandstone Stairs

### Plains
There are two types of farms found in plains villages:

- A large crop farm, with four patches divided by two irrigation canals, and two composters.
- A commonly-found small crop farm, with two patches divided by an irrigation canal, and a composter.

** Crops **
- Wheat

** Additional resources available **
- Dirt
- Oak Log
- Water

### Savanna
There are three types of farms found in savanna villages:

- Four patches separated by a walkway, and two composters.
- Irregular shape, dotted with dirt paths and a composter.
- Irregular shape, with a single melon and a composter.

** Crops **
- Melon
- Wheat

** Additional resources available **
- Acacia Log
- Acacia Planks
- Acacia Stairs
- Dirt
- Short Grass
- Grass Block
- Tall Grass

### Snowy plains
There are two types of farms found in snowy plains villages:

- A farm surrounded by stripped spruce wood with a lantern hanging over the water and a composter.
- A farm surrounded by snow blocks with a lantern between the water and a composter.

** Crops **
- Wheat

** Additional resources available **
- Lantern
- Snow
- Snow Block
- Spruce Fence
- Spruce Stairs
- Stripped Spruce Wood

### Taiga
There are three types of farms found in taiga villages:

- Two patches separated by a winding path and a composter, surrounded by pumpkins and two torches on pillars.
- A winding path on one side, surrounded by pumpkins, a composter, and two torches on pillars.
- A pumpkin farm with a composter, surrounded by cobblestone.

in Bedrock Edition, these structures also generate in the snowy taiga village variant, and are topped with snow layers wherever there is sky access.

** Crops **
- Pumpkin
- Wheat

** Additional resources available **
- Cobblestone Stairs
- Cobblestone Wall
- Dirt
- Fern
- Grass Block
- Dirt Path
- Large Fern
- Mossy Cobblestone
- Spruce Trapdoor
- Torch
