# The End
The End is a dark, space-like dimension consisting of separate islands in the void, made out of end stone. It is inhabited by endermen and shulkers. The ender dragon also spawns when the player first arrives. The End is the end goal of Minecraft. The Ender Dragon is considered the final boss, and it is necessary to defeat it to "beat" the game and see the end credits.

## Accessing
Main article: End Portal
An activated end portal found in a stronghold.
To access the End, the player must go through the process of finding a stronghold using eyes of ender, finding the portal room, and activating the end portal in the end portal room. The room consists of a 5×5 square of end portal frames, with the corners cut out, making a total of 12. The portal hangs over a lava pool, with a staircase leading up to it. A silverfish spawner sits on top of the staircase. 

The player can activate the portal by filling the 12 end portal frames each with an eye of ender. Each frame block has a 10% chance of generating with an eye in it already, meaning the player may not necessarily use 12 eyes to activate it. Once all the eyes of ender are placed, the portal activates and emits a loud noise. As soon as it is activated, the portal destroys all blocks in the central 3×3 square, including bedrock or another portal frame, and replaces them with the end portal blocks that can teleport an entity into the End dimension. Upon jumping into the portal, the player immediately arrives in the End (x: 100, z: 0), along with any prior entities that may have teleported.

If cheats are enabled, players can also teleport to the End without using an end portal: the command /execute in the_end allows the player to select their teleportation destination in the End directly.

## Environment
The End consists of one large island surrounded at a distance by many smaller islands, all mainly composed of end stone. There is a gap between the central island and the outer islands of about 1000 blocks with nothing but the void.

The starless sky and the void of the End are both composed of a blank, static pattern. The daylight cycle is absent in the End, similar to the Nether, being replaced by a constant dim light.

Weather cycle does not exist in the End, meaning there is no rain, snowfall or thunderstorms.

Most items and blocks function in the End exactly as they do in the Overworld, with a few notable exceptions:

- Bedsandrespawn anchorscause anexplosion25% stronger thanTNTand causefireswhen one attempts tousethem, as beds do inthe Netherand respawn anchors in theOverworld. (Villagers, if somehow brought in, can still usebedssafely);
- Compassesare unable to find the originalspawnpoint, as spawn points cannot be set within the End, but compass used onLodestonestill works;
- Clocksare unable to determine the position of thesunandmoon, as there is nodaylight cyclein the End. Clocks instead spin randomly as they do in the Nether;
- Nether portalscannot be activated by theplayerin the End (although they can be placed throughcommandsor externalprograms and editors).
- Fire burns indefinitely onbedrock, but does not naturally spread onto other blocks of bedrock, as withnetherrack.

### Biomes
There are 5 biomes that make up the End in Java Edition. Beds and respawn anchors still explode if the biome is set in the Overworld. In Bedrock Edition, all End biomes are classified as a single biome, which is the_End. In both versions, if the biome is set to "the End" in the Overworld, the sky appears as a light gray version of the normal Overworld sky.

| Central island    | The center of the End is a large, asteroid-like island composed entirely ofend stone, floating in the void. At a distance of 1000 blocks away, an expanse of more islands begins, away from the main island. These consist of large islands, about the size of the main island, and smaller ones, which tend to be thin.                                                            |       |

| Obsidian platform | The obsidian platform is a 5 by 5 square of obsidian that is generated once a player or entity enters the End. If theobsidianis destroyed, or if a block is placed on top of the three air blocks above any part of the platform when the player enters the End, the obsidian is restored and any blocks on top of those three air blocks above the platform are replaced with air. |       |

### Terrain features
#### Main island
All players begin their exploration of the End with the main island. Unlike nether portals, entering the end portal instantly teleports the player to the End, giving no time to back out. Upon arrival in the End, the player is placed on a 5×5×1 obsidian platform with 3 layers of air blocks above it, if there are any blocks in a 3 block space above the platform, they are deleted upon a player entering an end portal. The platform can generate on the island, within it, or at a short distance from it, close enough to throw an ender pearl to reach the island. It always generates centered on the coordinates (100, 49, 0) with the player facing west.

Once the player enters the End, the only way back is to die or defeat the ender dragon. The dragon spawns naturally and flies around above ten towers of obsidian arranged in a circle around the central Exit Portal, which fills up at the end of the battle. On top of each tower lies an end crystal, some of which are protected by cages of iron bars. These crystals heal the dragon, but can be destroyed by hitting it (even with projectiles). Destroying the crystal while the dragon is healing damages the dragon.

Once defeated, the dragon goes to the exit portal at (0, 64, 0), rises into the sky and disintegrates, with bright beams of light flashing from its body. It then explodes, drops 12,000 (first dragon) or 500 (all subsequent dragons) experience orbs, activates the exit portal, and generates one end gateway (first 20 dragons only). This gives the player access to the End's outer islands. Atop the exit portal lies four torches and the dragon egg. After killing the dragon, it can be respawned an unlimited number of times by placing four end crystals on the sides of the exit portal.  Respawning the ender dragon regenerates any obsidian pillar blocks previously mined by the player, as well as the torches on the exit portal. However, the dragon egg does not regenerate upon killing a respawned ender dragon.

The End's outer islands are clustered around the main island.
Once the player enters the exit portal, the "end poem" is displayed, therefore "completing" the game. The player then respawns wherever their spawn is set in the Overworld or in the Nether, and may return to the End through the same portal (or a different portal from another stronghold); the End remains in the same state as the player left it. The obsidian platform is regenerated each time a player enters the End, meaning that any blocks or block entities placed in the 5×5×4 space on or above the platform are destroyed and replaced with obsidian and air blocks.

#### Outer islands
The End's outer islands are more diverse than the main island. When a player enters one of the end gateways that generate after killing the dragon, they are instantly teleported over the ~1000 block void to the outer islands. These gateway portals are easiest to enter through the use of ender pearls, due to the one block tall gap between the bedrock blocks, but can also be entered by placing water and swimming through, using a trapdoor or piston to force the player to crawl, or with skilled use of a pair of elytra.

The outer islands vary in size. There are occasional "mini islands" in the gaps between the larger ones, generally with nothing on them (occasionally they generate end gateways that return the player to the obsidian platform). The larger islands can also vary in size but are generally a hundred to several hundred blocks wide. The gaps between these islands are generally short enough that players can travel between them via ender pearls.

These outer islands generate up to the world border. Some are topped with a forest of chorus trees that may be harvested for its chorus fruit, and perhaps chorus flowers, to grow it in the Overworld. The player may find end cities (which may generate ships with them) on these islands, which hold exclusive loot. Elytra and the dragon head can only be found on the end ships.

In Java Edition, due to a bug[1], the outer End islands fail to generate in multiple concentric rings. The first ring ends at ±370,719 on the X and Z axes, cutting off terrain generation in a doughnut shape. It continues empty, but the second ring starts at X/Z=±524,288, then disappears again at X/Z=±642,111 and comes back at X/Z=±741,456. It continues like this all the way until the world border, getting closer and closer. If the world border would be removed, going far enough would lead to world looking slightly like the stripe lands of Bedrock Edition.

### Mobs
The End is home to three naturally occurring mobs:

- Endermenspawn naturally throughout the entire dimension.
- Theender dragonspawns naturally on the central island when the player first arrives, but can be respawned by placing 4end crystals, one on each side's middle block of theexit portal.
- Shulkersappear withinend citieson the outer islands. They do not respawn once killed, but can sometimes clone themselves when attacked by another shulker.

Other mobs except for the wither may be sent into the End through an end portal. (The wither can still be built in the End as usual.)
