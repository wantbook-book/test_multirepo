# Stronghold
A stronghold is a structure that occurs naturally underground in the Overworld, and is the only place where an end portal can be found. Strongholds can be located by using an eye of ender.

## Generation
This article is about the generation mechanics.  For locating strongholds, see Eye of Ender § Locating strongholds.
The end portal room.
Strongholds generate at any Y level, mostly underground, and prefer to generate in biomes above sea level, but generate underwater if necessary. Strongholds may generate at bedrock level, cutting the bedrock.

Most parts of the stronghold can be overwritten by caves, ocean monuments, ancient cities, mineshafts, fossils, amethyst geodes, and monster rooms; but it is rare for the end portal to be replaced, which would force a player to find one of the other strongholds, as a portal can be activated only with all 12 end portal frames present. Canyons do not overwrite strongholds; rather, a stronghold can occasionally be found exposed by a canyon.

### Bedrock Edition
In Bedrock Edition, strongholds generate randomly throughout the world and they are at least 160 blocks away from the world origin. There is no limit to the number of strongholds that can generate, unlike in Java Edition. There are 3 extra strongholds at least 453 blocks away from the world origin, which tend to be close to the origin, and are guaranteed to generate below a village.

### Java Edition
Stronghold layout through the world in Java Edition.
In Java Edition, all strongholds are located at random coordinates within rings in all biomes, where each ring is a certain radius from the center of the world (X=0, Z=0).  For a given ring, the strongholds are generated at roughly equal angles from the center point of the world (for instance, each stronghold in a ring of 3 is in the region of 120 degrees from the others, measured from the origin). The game does not generate a stronghold partially above ground; any portion above the sea level is replaced with air, leaving a cutaway. If a stronghold generates in an ocean, which occurs rarely, it typically generates with terrain covered above it.

There are eight rings, containing 128 strongholds in total:

1. The first ring has 3 strongholds within 1,280–2,816 blocks of the origin.
2. The second ring has 6 strongholds within 4,352–5,888 blocks of the origin.
3. The third ring has 10 strongholds within 7,424–8,960 blocks of the origin.
4. The fourth ring has 15 strongholds within 10,496–12,032 blocks of the origin.
5. The fifth ring has 21 strongholds within 13,568–15,104 blocks of the origin.
6. The sixth ring has 28 strongholds within 16,640–18,176 blocks of the origin.
7. The seventh ring has 36 strongholds within 19,712–21,248 blocks of the origin.
8. The eighth and outermost ring has 9 strongholds within 22,784-24,320 blocks of the origin.

The number of strongholds in each ring is the triangular number of that ring, except for the outermost one, which has 9 strongholds instead of the expected 45 if the sequence had continued.

## Structure
Main article: /Structure
Strongholds vary in size. They contain several doors and rooms made mostly of stone bricks (45%), mossy stone bricks (30%), cracked stone bricks (20%) and infested stone bricks (5%). Infested cracked stone bricks and infested mossy stone bricks do not generate, unless silverfish enter these blocks.[1] Strongholds are lit by enough torches to provide visibility in most areas, though not enough to suppress mob spawns. Stairs that generate within these structures include stone brick and cobblestone stairs, but not their mossy variants.[2]

In generated chest corridors and storerooms, dispersed chests containing a variety of loot can be found.

### Rooms
Strongholds feature various types of main rooms. Each room has an entrance, which is either a plain 3×3 opening, a wall with a wooden door, a wall with an iron door (with a stone button on each side), or a 3×3 opening with a gate of iron bars along the top and sides. Rooms may have exits to other room pieces or dead-end "exits" into stone. Additional "passages" between rooms may exist if their generation overlaps or if the stronghold intersects a cave, mineshaft, or other structure. Sometimes, doors can be sealed off by stone bricks in 5-way crossings, resulting in "secret doors".[3]

Stronghold generation begins with a spiral staircase room with a 5-way crossing at the bottom, with additional rooms being randomly generated from the exits of previous rooms up to a maximum distance of 50 rooms and 112 blocks horizontally. If a portal room is not generated, the generation is redone. 

The wooden and iron doors always face the direction the stronghold generates toward, meaning a door flush with the wall always leads away from the starting staircase, and a door indented into the wall leads toward the starting staircase. 

- End portal room: Contains anend portaland asilverfishmonster spawner. There are two pools of 3lavasources in the front sides of the room and a bigger lava pool of 9 below the end portal, and 16 windows of 2iron barsin the room, with the entrance, always being a gate of iron bars. In most cases, this room cannot be overwritten by other structures generated around it. Only one generates per stronghold, and it is never within 5 rooms of the starting staircase, although it is less likely to generate farther away from the starting staircase. Each portal frame has a 10% chance to generate containing an eye; the average number of portal frames found prefilled is 1.2. The chance of the portal being completely pre-filled is one in atrillion(1:1,000,000,000,000 or 10-12).
	- InJava Edition, all seeds for 1.16 that have a pre-activated end portal in the first ring have been found.[4]
- Library(seebelow): 0–2 libraries per stronghold, and never within 4 rooms of the starting staircase.
- Large room: A room with three exits (four counting the entrance). The center of the room may have various decorations. 0–6 rooms per stronghold.
	- Empty room: Has no decoration.
	- Stone Pillar room: Has a stone brick pillar with torches on it.
	- Fountain room: Contains a fountain in the center, which consists of a stone brick ring and pillar with a water source block on top of the pillar.
	- Storeroom: A dual-level room, each 2 blocks high, with acobblestonecenter structure joining the two. A lonetorchis housed within the structure. A ladder runs up the sidewall for access to the second floor, which is a chamber made of oakplankscontaining a lootchest.
- Five-way crossing: Has up to five exits (six counting the entrance): one across from the entrance down a short stairway made of smooth stone slabs and stone brick blocks, one each to the left and right of the entrance, one on the left side of the upper level reached by a short stairway made of smooth stone slabs and stone brick blocks, and one on the right side of the upper level across a bridge of smooth stone slabs and double smooth stone slabs over the downward stair. A single torch is on the side of the bridge. InBedrock Edition, it usually has 1–4 entrances sealed. There is always one crossing in every stronghold as part of the starting point, while an extra 0-4 crossings may also generate.
- Empty prison cells: A corridor with one wall partially made ofiron barsand with two irondoors(in an "open" position, with nobuttons). Beyond each iron door are cells with an iron bar wall between them. An exit is opposite the entrance. 0–5 rooms per stronghold. InBedrock Edition, no iron doors are generated.
- Spiral staircase: A 3×3 spiral stair made of stone bricks and smooth stoneslabs, leading down, with an exit at the bottom. Like 5-way crossings, there is always one flight per stronghold as part of the starting point, while an additional 0–5 flights may also generate.
- Straight staircase: A 3 block wide staircase of cobblestone stairs leading downward, with an exit at the bottom of the stairs. There is also an empty alcove under the stairs. 0–5 flights per stronghold.
- Corridor: A bare corridor with up to 3 exits: one straight ahead, and optional exits to the left and right.
- Chest corridor: A corridor with a small altar made of stone brick slabs, with a lootcheston the altar. An exit is on the opposite side of the entrance. 0–4 corridors per stronghold.
- Corridor turn: A bare corridor with one exit, left or right. May resemble a small room if both the entrance and the next room's entrance have doors.
- Dead-end corridor: A bare corridor with no exits, although it is likely to intersect other rooms. This room type never has a door or gate at the entrance.

### Libraries
A library inside a stronghold.
Libraries occur in two sizes: small single-level libraries and larger duplex libraries. All libraries contain bookshelves, oak planks, and one (single level) or two (duplex) chests, with cobwebs dispersed randomly.

Small libraries usually generate when the second level of the library is blocked by another part of the stronghold. If there are no obstructions, then large libraries usually generate.

Large libraries contain a second level consisting of a surrounding balcony with oak fences as railings, and fences & torches arranged like a chandelier over the center of the room. The two levels are connected by a ladder on the wall furthest from the entrance. No cobwebs generate on the second level.

Libraries are the most well-lit rooms in the stronghold, having enough torches to prevent mob spawning entirely within them.
