# Java Edition 3D Shareware v1.34
3D Shareware v1.34 is an April Fools' joke release in 2019, officially called Minecraft 3D.[1] This version has many references to video gaming in the 1990s. This release is a fork of the game at version 19w13b.

According to the developers, Minecraft 3D is an "old version" of Minecraft released on April 1, 1994, of which only "a handful of copies were ever made", one of which (a supposed copy of Shareware v1.34) was discovered "amongst all the rubble" lying in the basement of Mojang's old offices. It was said to be "a masterpiece of its all time" featuring "cutting-edge technology" that won many awards,[1] although this is all part of the joke.

### Mobs
** Elder guardian **
- Now drops a blue key.

** Ravager **
- Now drops a yellow key.

** Wither **
- Now drops a red key.

** Creeper **
- Now has an NBT tag calledd20(1 = true/0 = false) that determines whether the creeper is a nerd.

** Rendering **
- Most entities render viabillboarding, which explains the 2D model of the barrel above.
	- One exception is theplayer.

### Gameplay
- The game always runs in demo mode, even if no--demoflag is present, which is why noRealmsbutton exists.
	- Like normal, after a 5 in-game day counter, the player is unable to use, break or place any blocks, at which point attempting to do so shows a message that the demo has expired, but normally the player can start a new world, but in this case the player cannot play anymore unless they delete or rename their world file and create a new one.
- The maximum level of Multishot is now 12.
- Higher levels of Multishot now fire more arrows.
- Pop-ups appear randomly saying "Next disc required", similar to the "MinecraftDemo mode" pop-up, telling the player to "Insert disc [random number] into drive A and press ENTER", if the player presses a button besidesENTERit displays "I said ENTER!" in red text below the message. If the player pressesENTERthe popup disappears.
- Upon selecting an "episode" and difficulty, the player is prompted with a traditional Minecraft Demo popup. Clicking "Open registration form" causes the game to create a text document called "ORDER.TXT" containing several fake games and merchandise that the player can "order" in the "MOJANG ORDER SHEET", which appears to ship the purchase to "Mojang PC Repair and Software AB" in Stockholm, Sweden.
	- The fake games/merchandise are as listed below:
		- "MineCraft 3D - Immersive virtual-reality mining simulation with intense crafting capabilities! Our freshest and radicalest game!"
		- "MineCraft 3D: Deeper and darker - Gigantic expansion pack: 3 new ores, 7 new weapons and 11 new enemy variants. Including Buff Crepper  [sic] and Evilshroom II!"
		- "MineCraft 3D: Mines of North Pole - Obligatory holiday map pack. Ideal for X-mas '94!"
		- "MineCraft 3D: Strategy Guide - Only the hottest of tips, guides and cheats! Mandatory for every pickaxe maniac!"
		- "MineCraft 3D: Themed PC-Speaker Set - Collectors' item! Guarantees best sound experience!"
		- "MineCraft 3D: Sticket  [sic] set - "Better than nothing". Ideal for your younger sibling!"
		- "[COMMING  [sic] SOON] MineCraft 3D: Action figurine set - You have to acquire them all!"
		- "MineCraft 2 - Classic 2D Minecraft experience. If you haven't played it yet, shame on you!" (possible reference to theJava Edition 2.0April Fools' update)
		- "MineCraft 2: Swedish Parliamentary Elections edition - Finally, the expansion pack you've been waiting for!"
		- "MineCraft 2: All the guns! - 'Nuff said"
		- "Fermented Herring Simulator VII - Why do you keep asking for this?"
		- "Fermented Herring Simulator VII: Thorium Pack - No! Really, stop!"
		- "Fermented Herring Simulator VII: Scratch and sniff"
		- "Doom 2 - Completely not related to other games named Doom. This one is about gardening."
	- The document has several typos that seem to be intentional.
	- According to the document, "Orders must be received by April 1st 1995 or while stocks last".

** Difficulty **
- When selecting difficulty in the "Select difficulty" menu each mode is displayed differently than is in-game:
	- Peaceful is "Hello, NoobVille"
	- Easy is "Filthy casual!"
	- Normal is "Lemon curry?"
	- Hard is "eXtreme to the maXxXxX!"
	- "Obligatory nightmare mode" functions the same as Hard, but the player continually receives damage.

### General
** Loading screen **
- The loading screen at first appears similar to a DOS command prompt, displaying "By 1991–1994 Mojang Repair and Software... Loading Minecraft 3D" and several other pieces of information.
	- Shortly after this prompt, the screen switches to a pure white background, with a version of the Mojang logo appearing in the center of the screen, floating around, rotating and growing bigger as it gets closer until it comes to a halt at the center of the screen, displaying the company name MOJANG underneath it witha person saying "Mojang!" similar to how "Sega!" would be said on a Sega start up screen.
- A prompt above the loading- and title screens displays the message "UNREGISTERED VERSION" in green text against a red background scrolling from left to right.

** Title screen **
- "Demo mode" is always set to "true".
- The "Play Demo World" button is now labeled as "Select episode".
	- Clicking on it displays a list of five "episodes", only one of which is actually accessible, the others "Available in registered version". The list of episodes as follows:
		- "The player is you!" (the only accessible episode)
		- "Knee-deep in lava"
		- "Not just the endermen"
		- "RemovingHerobrine"
		- "All these worlds are yours except..."
- The "Reset Demo World" button is now labeled as "ModemPlay(TM)" [sic] and clicking on it displays "Blip blop".
	- Clicking on it again displays "Nej!" ("No!" in Swedish) until the player reloads the title screen.
	- The button is always available even if the demo world doesn't exist.
- A large image of a rotating 3D logo appears next to splashes.

** HUD **
- Health and armor are displayed as percentages.
	- The display slots are empty inCreativemode.
- The player's head and torso is displayed as a portrait, with the head randomly turning left and right.
- Hunger is displayed as araw beeficon on top of abone.
	- Only the bone is displayed inCreativemode.
