## Obtaining
Reinforced deepslate is not obtainable in Survival, even with Silk Touch, and is only available through the Creative inventory or commands. It cannot be pushed by a piston, is highly blast resistant, has higher hardness than obsidian, and cannot be destroyed by the wither or the ender dragon.

### Breaking
Reinforced deepslate has no tool associated with it, meaning it is mined at the exact same speed regardless of the tool used.
