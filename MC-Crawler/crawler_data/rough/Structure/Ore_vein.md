## Structure

A fully exposed copper ore vein
Ore veins occur as large branching networks of a filler rock, paired with high concentrations of an associated ore type. Copper veins generate above Y=0 and contain copper ore and raw copper, with granite as the filler material. Iron veins generate below Y=0 and contain iron ore and raw iron, with tuff as the filler material.

Ore veins can snake and branch and eventually dead-end, and are similar to spaghetti caves in their shape and scale. Where they intersect caves, the player can easily spot them in the floors, walls, and ceilings. In some cases, more than 2,000 of a particular ore can be found in a single vein.[more information needed]

Technically, ore veins are a part of cave generation and are not decorators. This means they are overridden by caves, mineshafts or other underground structures. This also means they can generate in The Void biome.

Ore distribution graph for 1.18
Each vein has a randomly picked richness value between 0.1 and 0.3, representing the proportion of ore material in the vein, with the rest being filler material. 98% of the non-filler blocks generate as normal ore blocks, while 2% are generated as raw ore blocks (block of raw copper and block of raw iron, respectively).

The blocks used in vein generation is hardcoded, though their size can be changed with datapacks.

## Finding veins
These can be found less easily than underground generated structures, but if searched for by caving, they can eventually generally be found up to every few (or several) "stack(s)" (64 \times *x*) of chunks in sideways-distance between any of them (very roughly[more information needed]).  When not caving (or exploring underground generated structures, most of which contain air), much less air is exposed, and notably their (ore) generation is seemingly unaffected by air-adjacency; more air, more ore (of this kind, visible).

Smaller veins can be still very useful compared to other randomly clumped, smaller ore blobs or deposits, as they all seem to be big enough to show exactly how these other larger ones appear, across multiple surfaces and directions.  For iron ore veins, they can be a useful tuff source.  As with other underground formations (including lava, creating safe routes and now water aquifers creating air pocket routes), following along them by finding their edges to mine the most (all of which can find the smaller ore blobs again hidden away from air) is more likely to find further underground formations very close to them, including at least other mostly-underground caves.
