## Generation
The exit portal always generates at the coordinates 0,0 in the End, and is de-activated whenever an ender dragon fight is in progress. The y-level of the portal is determined by the height of the terrain, placing the portal blocks at the y-level of the highest block found at 0,0. If the exit portal spawns at the top of the world, the portal blocks are the highest blocks generated, with the top 3 blocks of the bedrock pillar failing to generate due to the maximum build height having been reached. If there are no blocks at 0,0, then the portal generates out of bounds, and only the top 3 blocks of the bedrock pillar generate.

The exit portal looks similar to the end portal but differs in its design. Instead of a frame of end portal frame blocks, it has a 7-block wide bowl-shaped frame of bedrock, and a central pillar of bedrock with a torch on each side. A dragon egg generates atop the pillar upon defeating the ender dragon for the first time.

There are 16 end stone blocks, one under each outer bedrock block, as well as four torches. If any of the blocks are removed, they regenerate when the ender dragon is defeated or respawned. (Note: the torches are attached to the central second-to-the-top block of bedrock pillar)

## Behavior
The portal returns the player to their spawn point. Upon respawning, all effects are removed from the player.[1] The credits roll when a player enters the exit portal for the first time. 

If an entity other than a player goes through, like a falling block or a thrown item, it is sent to the world spawn. 

If a player dies above the portal (for example by flying into the bedrock column with enough momentum) the player goes through. If this happens, the player's items return to the world spawn point.
