## Generation
Nether fossils generate randomly throughout the Nether in soul sand valleys.

## Structure
Main article: /Structure
Nether fossils are composed of 5 to 27 bone blocks. Unlike regular fossils, they do not have a lowered structure integrity and no blocks are replaced with coal or diamond ore. They are made with the NBT structure block format and the NBT files for each fossil are stored in the folder minecraft.jar/data/minecraft/structures/nether_fossils.

There are 14 different variants of nether fossils:
