## Generation
Potato mineshafts generate below Y = 60 in all of the biomes in the Potato dimension. Because most of this dimension is empty, large portions of these mineshafts hang over the void.

## Structure
Potato mineshafts are made up of blocks related to potato wood: planks, fences, and stems. Instead of chains, they are held by potato pedicules that connect them to the terrain above. Monster spawners, which spawn cave spiders, generate in the same way as in regular mineshafts.

Some terrain features, like clusters of ancient debris in wasteland biome, can generate on the structure.

## Loot
Unlike regular mineshafts, this structure generates with no chest minecarts, and does not have any loot.
