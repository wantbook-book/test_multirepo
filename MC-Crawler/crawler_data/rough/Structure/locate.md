## Usage
For /locate structure ..., the vertical coordinate of structure is ignored when finding. In Java Edition, the horizonal search range is 201x201 units of the Structure's spacing (see Default structure sets for values). For example, Mansions have a spacing of 80 chunks, so it can search out ±128,000 blocks before failure. For concentric ring structures like Strongholds, there is no set max distance. Structures in the Anvil chunk region of the command's execution are prioritized over others due to a bug, meaning the found structure is not necessarily the closest.[1]

For /locate biome ..., the horizonal search resolution is 32 blocks, and vertical resolution is 64 blocks, which means biomes that are too narrow may not be found. The horizonal search range is 12801×12801 blocks in Java Edition.[more information needed]

In Java Edition, for /locate poi ..., the search range is a ball with a radius of 256 blocks.

When locating structure or POI, if successful, the following message is sent to chat: "The nearest <requested thing(s)> is at [<x> ~ <z>] (<distance> blocks away)", in which <distance> is the horizontal distance from the executor. 

When locating biome, if successful, the following message is sent to chat: "The nearest <requested biome(s)> is at [<x> <y> <z>] (<distance> blocks away)", in which <distance> is the distance from the executor to the biome. 

In Java Edition, the coordinates in these messages can be clicked, which can put the command /tp @s <x> ~ <z> in the chat box. The command can then be executed, and the player is sent to those coordinates.

## Syntax
- Java Edition

/locate structure <structure>
/locate biome <biome>
/locate poi <poi>
- Bedrock Edition

/locate structure <structure: Structure> [useNewChunksOnly: Boolean]
/locate biome <biome: Biome>
## Arguments
JE : <biome>: resource_or_tag
BE: biome: Biome: enum

Specifies thebiometo locate. InJava Edition, this argument also supports biometags.

Specifies the structure to locate. SeeGenerated structures#Data values.
InJava Edition, must be aresource locationor atag, which is resolved during command execution into an entry or tag inminecraft:worldgen/structureregistry. InBedrock Edition, must be an ID of agenerated structure(without namespace)
BE: useNewChunksOnly: Boolean: enum

Specifies if a structure of any type wants to be located in new chunks only (true) or not (false), and it'sfalseby default.
