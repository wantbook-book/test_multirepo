# Amethyst geode
An amethyst geode is a feature found in the underground of the Overworld. Amethyst geodes contain smooth basalt, calcite, and are the main source of amethyst shards and blocks.

## Generation
Amethyst geodes generate between Y=-58 and Y=30. Each chunk has a 1‚ÅÑ24 chance to attempt to generate a geode.

## Structure
The inside of a cracked amethyst geode.
Amethyst geodes consist of three layers: an outer layer of smooth basalt, a middle layer of calcite, and a hollow layer of primarily amethyst blocks, with 8.3% replaced by budding amethyst blocks instead. Amethyst crystals generate within the structure on budding amethyst. Geodes have a 95% chance of generating with a crack, exposing its inside. Caves, aquifers and canyons may be overridden by geodes,[1] and as such are often obstructed by them.

			- A block state.
				- 
				- Block state
		- cannot_replaceA block tag with#listing which blocks not to replace.
		- invalid_blocksA block tag with#listing invalid blocks. Due toMC-264886, any value is treated as#minecraft:geode_invalid_blocks. Additionally, air is an invalid block.
	- layersThe max radius of each layer. Higher value results in higher max radius of each layer.
		- filling(optional, defaults to 1.7) Value between 0.01 and 50 (inclusive).
		- inner_layer(optional, defaults to 2.2) Value between 0.01 and 50 (inclusive).
		- middle_layer(optional, defaults to 3.2) Value between 0.01 and 50 (inclusive).
		- outer_layer(optional, defaults to 4.2) Value between 0.01 and 50 (inclusive).
	- crackThe configuration of the crack on the geode.
		- generate_crack_chance(optional, defaults to 1.0) The probability for generating crack. Value between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive).
		- base_crack_size(optional, defaults to 2) Value between 0.0 and 5.0 (inclusive).
		- crack_point_offset(optional, defaults to 2) Value between 0 and 10 (inclusive).
	- noise_multiplier(optional, defaults to 0.05) Value between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive).
	- use_potential_placements_chance(optional, defaults to 0.35) The probability for placing the inner placement on a block of inner layer. Value between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
	- use_alternate_layer0_chance(optional, defaults to 0.0) The probability of the alternate blocks on inner layer. Value between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
	- placements_require_layer0_alternate(optional, defaults to true) Whether the inner placements are only allowed on the alternate inner blocks.
	- outer_wall_distance(optional, defaults to a uniform int between 4 and 5) The offset on each coordinate of the center from the feature start. Value between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
		- 
		- Int provider
	- distribution_points(optional, defaults to a uniform int between 3 and 4) Value between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
		- 
		- Int provider
	- invalid_blocks_thresholdCheckdistribution_pointstimes near the center of the geode, and if the number of invalid blocks found exceeds this number, the feature will not be generated.
	- point_offset(optional, defaults to a uniform int between 1 and 2) Value between 1 and 10.
		- 
		- Int provider
	- min_gen_offset(optional, defaults to -16) The minimum Chebyshev distance between the block and the center.
	- max_gen_offset(optional, defaults to 16) The maximum Chebyshev distance between the block and the center.
