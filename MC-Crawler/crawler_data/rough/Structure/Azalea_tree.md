## Appearance
Azalea trees are made of oak logs and azalea leaves on the surface. Their roots consist of rooted dirt and hanging roots, which reach all the way down to the lush cave.

## Generation
The rooted dirt and hanging roots that generate under an azalea tree.
Azalea trees generate on any empty space above a lush cave, including inside other caves or in biomes that are not grassy.[1]

Azaleas and flowering azaleas can be planted on:

- Dirt
- Grass Block
- Coarse Dirt
- Podzol
- Mycelium
- Rooted Dirt
- Moss Block
- Farmland
- Mud

Growing an azalea tree replaces the block below its trunk with rooted dirt. This only generates one block of rooted dirt and no hanging roots.[2] Azalea trees do not need to be grown over a lush caves biome; they work in anywhere, like saplings.
