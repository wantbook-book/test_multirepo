# Cauldron
A cauldron is a block that can contain water, lava or powder snow and, in certain situations, collect it from the environment. In Bedrock Edition, it can also hold potions or dyed water. It also serves as a leatherworker's job site block.

## Obtaining
### Breaking
A cauldron can be obtained using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. Regardless of the tool, when a cauldron is destroyed, its contents are lost.

1. ↑Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

### Natural generation
A naturally occurring cauldron inside of a witch hut. Notice the incorrect cat skin.
A single empty cauldron is generated in each swamp hut. In Bedrock Edition, the cauldrons generated there are 1⁄3 to 2⁄3 full of a random potion.

A cauldron 2⁄3 full of water is generated in each igloo basement.

Cauldron in woodland mansion jail.
Cauldrons can be found in a few rooms inside of woodland mansions.

Two filled cauldrons can be found inside savanna, taiga, snowy taiga, and snowy tundra village tannery houses.

A single filled cauldron can be found in plains village and desert village tannery houses.

In Java Edition, three filled cauldrons can be found in plains village tannery houses.

Cauldrons can also spawn in trail ruins.

### Crafting
A cauldron can be crafted from iron ingots.

## Usage
### Storage for substances
Cauldrons can hold a variety of substances. Fluids they cannot hold include milk, honey and any food items that exist in bowls; namely mushroom stew, beetroot soup, rabbit stew and suspicious stew. In Java Edition, cauldrons containing fluids are considered by the game to be separate blocks from each other and from empty cauldrons, which does not affect gameplay but does affect the commands needed to place them.

#### Holding water
A cauldron can be filled with water by using a water bucket on the cauldron. Once completely filled, a cauldron can be used to fill a water bucket by using an empty bucket on the cauldron; this empties the cauldron. Despite containing water, using a fish bucket on a cauldron does not fill it with water, but places water against it, meaning it does nothing to the cauldron.[1]

A cauldron can also be filled by dumping a water bucket on the block above the cauldron. Once the water block is removed, the cauldron is filled to the full level with water.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

In Java Edition, a cauldron can contain three levels of water. One level of water can be added to a cauldron by using a water bottle on it. One level of water can be removed from a cauldron, filling a water bottle, by using a glass bottle on it.

In Bedrock Edition, a cauldron can contain six levels of water, and using a water bottle or a bottle on a cauldron respectively adds or removes two levels from it. If there are less than two levels remaining, a bottle cannot be used to retrieve the remaining water, and it must be either replaced or removed through a method that reduces the level by one. 

A cauldron slowly fills with water when rained upon, if starting empty or with some water. This happens randomly, at 5% of the rate in which snow accumulates on the ground during snowfall.

Water can be stored in a cauldron, even in the Nether. Water in a cauldron does not freeze in cold biomes.

Water in a cauldron does not absorb explosion damage; make sounds and particles; absorb fall damage;[2][3] allow tridents enchanted with Riptide to activate;[4][5] or damage endermen‌‌[JE  only], striders, or blazes.[6][7] Cauldrons do not deal drowning damage to mobs inside of them[8] and fish act as if there is no water inside it.[9] The player cannot float or swim in it, as the water is about level with the player's waist. Jumping in a cauldron does not produce any bubble or water particles.

A cauldron placed below a down-facing pointed dripstone that has water placed a block above it slowly fills with water. The same works with lava, allowing for infinite lava generation.

Attempting to add lava or potion to water empties the cauldron.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

The water in a cauldron cannot be sucked up by a sponge, whether the sponge is touching the cauldron or not.

#### Applying dye to cauldron water

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition. 


In Bedrock Edition, leather armor is dyed through a cauldron, so a cauldron can hold dyed water. Using a dye on a cauldron filled with water colors the water, consuming the dye. Different dyes may be added to produce mixed colors. Using leather armor or leather horse armor on the cauldron dyes that item the color of the water, reducing the water in the cauldron by one level for each item dyed.

Attempting to add water, lava or potion to dyed water empties the cauldron.

#### Holding lava
Cauldron filled with lava
Cauldrons can be used to hold lava. In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, when a cauldron is already filled with water, it empties the cauldron and makes an extinguishing sound. A cauldron filled with lava emits a light level of 15, similar to lava, and burns any entity inside of it; in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, this includes mobs that do not take damage from lava like zombified piglins.

Lava inside a cauldron does not interact with water outside of the cauldron. The lava disappears upon putting water in the cauldron.

A redstone comparator with a lava cauldron behind it outputs redstone signal strength of 3.[10][11]

A cauldron placed below a down-facing pointed dripstone that has lava placed a block above it slowly fills with lava.

If a cauldron is filled by lava, using glass bottles on the cauldron does nothing.

#### Holding powder snow
Powder snow is currently the only solid material that can be stored in a cauldron. A cauldron slowly fills with powder snow during snowfall, if starting empty or with any layer of powder snow already inside. Up to three‌[JE  only] or six‌[BE  only] layers can be filled. When the cauldron is full, interacting using a bucket, creates a powder snow bucket and empties the cauldron. Entities standing in the cauldron do not take freeze damage, and entities wearing leather boots still fall through the powder snow.

A redstone comparator with a powder snow cauldron behind it outputs a redstone signal strength proportional to the fill level, up to 3.

Contrary to a cauldron filled with water, a powder snow cauldron that is not full cannot be filled up with a powder snow bucket, as using the bucket on the cauldron instead places powder snow against it.

#### Holding potions

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition and  Minecraft Education. 


In Bedrock Edition, a cauldron can hold normal potions, splash potions and lingering potions. Using a potion on a cauldron empties the potion and increases the level of the potion in the cauldron by two levels. A glass bottle can then be used on a cauldron with a potion in it, filling the bottle with that potion. This reduces the potion in the cauldron by two levels. If there is only one level of potion remaining, it cannot be retrieved using a bottle and must be either replaced or used to tip an arrow.

Using an arrow on a cauldron that contains a potion transforms the arrow into a tipped arrow with that potion effect, and reduces the potion in the cauldron by one level. Tipping multiple arrows at once can be more efficient, and it may use more than one level at once. 1 level of potion tips up to 16 arrows, 2 levels up to 32, 3 levels up to 48, and 4 levels up to a full stack of arrows, resulting in 21.33 tipped arrows per potion. The bottom three levels of a cauldron are only counted as a single level for the purposes of tipping arrows, therefore any quantity of arrows that would leave less than three levels of potion remaining when tipped empties the cauldron completely.

Attempting to put water, lava or a different potion into a cauldron with a potion causes an explosion sound, and the cauldron is emptied.

An entity that stands in a cauldron filled to any level with any potion does not receive the effect of the potion.

Using an empty bucket on a cauldron filled with any potion does nothing, as the bucket remains empty and the potion in the cauldron does not empty.

### Removing dye from items
A cauldron with water can wash the dye off of leather armor and shulker boxes, and can remove the top-most pattern layer of a banner, by pressing use on the cauldron with the leather armor, shulker box, or banner in hand. Each wash reduces the water in the cauldron by one level. The water does not become dyed while removing dye from objects.

### Changing profession
If a village has a cauldron that has not been claimed by a villager, any villager that does not already have a profession or job site block may change their profession to leatherworker.

### Extinguishing fire
A cauldron with water or powder snow extinguishes entities on fire that fall into it and the entity emits black particles. This includes mobs, players, items (if they land in the cauldron before burning up), and flaming arrows‌[JE  only]. Flaming arrows stuck into the side are also extinguished. Entities must reach the water or powder snow in it. Each entity extinguished causes the substance in the cauldron to decrease by one level. If the cauldron is filled with powder snow, it then becomes a water cauldron.

### Redstone component
An example of a cauldron used in a redstone circuit.
See also: Redstone circuit

A cauldron can act as a power source for a redstone comparator. With a cauldron behind it (either directly, or separated by an unpowered solid block), a comparator outputs a signal strength proportional to how full the cauldron is: 0 for empty, 1 for one-third full, 2 for two-thirds full, and 3 for completely full or filled with lava. However, if there is a block between the cauldron and the comparator, the comparator does not immediately update.
