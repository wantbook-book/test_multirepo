# Mangrove
A mangrove is a tree with large canopies and aerial root systems found in mangrove swamps. They can grow in water or on land, and their wood color is vermillion. They can be planted in the air, but their roots always touch the ground.

## Appearance
Mangroves consist of four large moss carpet-covered roots supporting a central trunk. From a large canopy hangs vines and mangrove propagules.

## Generation
Mangroves spawn naturally only in the mangrove swamp biome.

## Blocks and items
These items can be obtained from mangrove:

- Mangrove Leaves(harvested withshears)
- Mangrove Log(harvested with anytoolincluding hands)
- Stick(chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
- Mangrove Planks(created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
- Stripped Mangrove Log(created byusinganaxeon a log)
- Mangrove Propagule(if fully grown, drops when it is broken)
- Muddy Mangrove Roots(harvested with any tool including hands)
- Mangrove Roots(harvested with any tool including hands)
- Vines(harvested with shears)
- Moss Carpet(harvested with any tool including hands)
- Bee Nest(if present on a tree near flowers)

Mangrove propagules can be planted and grown on all of these blocks, even if submerged underwater:

- Dirt
- Grass Block
- Coarse Dirt
- Podzol
- Mycelium
- Rooted Dirt
- Moss Block
- Farmland
- Mud
- Muddy Mangrove Roots
- Clay

When mangrove trees grow, they convert any mud in the way of the mangrove roots to muddy mangrove roots. They require a minimum clear space of 5×5 to grow. However, they can grow in smaller spaces, like a 3×3 area, as long as the walls don't exceed 10 blocks in height from the block where you plant the sapling. In such cases, the tree grows on top of the confined space. The smallest box in which a tree can be planted is 5×5×5, and the tree's maximum size blueprint occupies a 13×13×18 volume.
