## Appearance
Potato trees vary greatly in size. The smaller trees resemble jungle bushes. The larger trees can be over 50 blocks tall and often have the shape of several acacia trees stacked on top of each other. A unique feature of potato trees is that they grow potato fruits, which hang from potato pedicules, like lanterns hanging from chains. These pedicules can be found hanging from stems or leaves in the upper parts of any potato tree.

Potato trees come in 3 variants, but don't have a display name. There is the regular potato tree (code name: potato_tree), the tall potato tree (larger than the regular tree, has the code name: potato_tree_tall), and the mother potato tree (the largest tree, with the code name: mother_potato_tree).

## Generation
Potato trees spawn naturally in the Potato dimension. They cover most of the corruption biome, and can be seen more rarely in arboretum.

Potato trees can also be grown from potato sprouts, although this sapling-like block does not grow into a tree on its own; bone meal must be applied in order for it to grow, similarly to fungi. Potato trees share more similarities with huge fungi: they aren't flammable, and they generate additional blocks (beyond stems and leaves) that emit light, the potato fruit.

However, unlike huge fungi, potato trees can sometimes generate with bee nests. Also, unlike an oak tree, generating a bee nest does not require the potato tree or sprout to be within proximity of a flower.
