## Obtaining
Minecarts with monster spawners cannot be obtained as an item in the inventory, and can only be produced using the /summon command or by using external tools.

## Usage
Main article: Monster Spawner
The monster spawner within behaves the same way as normal monster spawners, but the entity to be spawned cannot be set via using spawn eggs; the monster spawner's data can only be modified using commands or NBT edits. It has the same associated NBT tags as a normal monster spawner.[1]

More precisely, a minecart with monster spawner acts as a monster spawner block at the minecart's position. In other words, if the minecart with monster spawner moved within a block position, the range of spawn would not change, but if it moved 5 blocks east, the range of spawn would now be centered at the minecart with monster spawner's new position.

Spawner minecarts were used in some custom maps as a way to have redstone controlled monster spawners, however after the addition of the /summon and /setblock commands they were mostly rendered obsolete and are very rarely used today.

## Drops
When they are broken, minecarts with monster spawners drop 1 minecart. The monster spawner does not drop.
