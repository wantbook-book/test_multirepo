## Behavior
Markers are intended to have minimal behavior. Markers do not move, do not take damage, do not make sounds, and cannot be given status effects. They cannot support passengers (even when summoned with a Passengers tag, the passengers are not created).

Markers do not cause any updates. Markers only exist on the server side,[1] so they do not render. Using the debug key combination F3 + B, which normally draws the hitboxes of all visible entities, does not show a hitbox for a marker. Using F3 + I while aiming at a marker does not copy the entity data to the clipboard. They do not count toward the E-value (total amount of entities) listed on the debug screen. Markers do not obstruct the placement of blocks, nor do they push players or other entities away from their own position. Markers can be saved in structures via structure blocks.
