## Overview
Melee weapons can be held in the main hand while pressing the attack control to deal more damage than punching.

Ranged weapons can be used to fire projectiles.

- Aboworcrossbowis atoolthat usesarrowitems (or requires 1 arrow if it hasInfinity) and fires them as projectiles.
- Eggs,snowballs,splash potions,lingering potions, andwind chargescan be fired directly by using them.
- Fire chargesand wind charges are special "hurting" projectiles, which move in a straight line and aren't affected by gravity.

Block weapons are typically used by placing them. A redstone circuit can be used in various ways, depending on its design. 

## Melee weapons
Melee weapons can be used to deal damage within a player's reach distance. A player can attack with the held weapon by pressing the attack control. In Java Edition, the damage dealt by melee weapons is affected by the attack cooldown: in order to deal maximum damage again, the player must wait for the weapon to "recharge" after each attack.

- Swordsare the only weapon to get access toLooting,Fire Aspect,Knockback, andSweeping Edge.‌[Java Edition  only]InJava Edition, all swords have a cooldown time of 0.6 seconds (60% faster than golden, diamond, and netherite axes) and are the only weapon type that can dosweep attacksto hit multiple targets; they are generally the most effective melee weapon due to their high damage per second. InBedrock Edition, they deal more damage than any other melee weapon except fortridents. Swords can be crafted using sticks and material of their respective tier.

- Axesare the only weapon that can disable a player'sshield. InJava Edition, they deal more damage per hit than their sword counterparts, but have a slower cooldown. Wooden and stone axes have a cooldown time of 1.2 seconds, 80% slower than swords. Iron axes have a cooldown time of 1.1 seconds, 70% slower than swords. Golden, diamond, and netherite axes have a cooldown time of 1 second, 60% slower than swords. InBedrock Edition, axes deal 1less damage than their sword counterparts. Axes can be crafted using sticks and material of their respective tier.

- Tridentscan be swung to deal 9damage, the same as an unenchanted stone, iron, or diamond axe inJava Edition, or as an unenchantednetherite swordinBedrock Edition. InJava Edition, their attack speed is 10% faster than golden, diamond, and netherite axes, being 0.9 seconds. Tridents cannot be crafted, and have to be obtained from defeating certaindrowned, who also wield tridents.

- Maces‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0]deal 7base damage and, inJava Edition, have the same cooldown time as swords, at 0.6 seconds. The damage of a mace increases depending on the fall distance. They also reset fall damage when hitting an entity while falling. They can be crafted using abreeze rodandheavy core.

- Othertools,pickaxes,shovels, andhoescan be used as weapons, but they are not as effective as other melee weapons.

## Ranged weapons
Ranged weapons are less effective in close combat and more effective at attacking enemies from a distance.

- Bowsare the most common ranged weapon, used to shootarrowsat enemies to deal damage. Bows can be charged by pressing theusecontrol: arrows go the farthest and deal the most damage when shot from a fully charged bow. Bows can be crafted using sticks and string, but are also a rare drop fromskeletonsandstrays.

- Crossbowshave a longer range than bows, and deal more damage, but take longer to charge when unenchanted. The charging time can be drastically reduced with theQuick Chargeenchantment to charge far faster than a bow. They can also shootfirework rocketsto deal splash damage, but unlike the bow, crossbows cannot fire a partially charged attack; the player must fully charge a crossbow to load it and fire. Furthermore, a crossbow can be charged and put away to be fired later. Crossbows use triple durability when firing firework rockets, and also when fired while enchanted withMultishot. They can be crafted using sticks, string,iron ingots, andtripwire hooks, but can also be dropped from pillagers and certain piglins.

- Tridentscan also be thrown to deal 8damage, the same as an unenchanted netherite sword. Unlike most otherprojectiles, they are not slowed down in water. A thrown trident must be retrieved, unless enchanted withLoyalty.

- Fire chargescannot be launched by a player, but can be fired assmall fireballsby adispenser. When it hits an entity that is not immune to fire, a small fireball deals 5damage and sets the entity on fire for 4 seconds. When it lands on a block, it does not cause an explosion, but sets the block on fire if possible. It can also be used to prime TNT. Fire charges can be crafted usingcoal,blaze powder, andgunpowder.

- Splash potions,lingering potions, ortipped arrowsofInstant DamageorPoisoncan be effectively used to damage enemies. Other effects likeWeakness,Slowness, andSlow Fallingcan be used to significantly hinder an opponent in a fight. Splash potions can be obtained by brewing regular potions withgunpowder, lingering potions can be obtained by brewing splash potions withdragon's breath, andtipped arrowscan be obtained by crafting arrows with lingering potions, or, inBedrock Edition, by tipping arrows in apotion-filled cauldron.

- Snowballsandeggsdo not deal any damage, but can damagearmorand, inBedrock Edition, dealknockback. Unlike a bow, they can be thrown quickly.Ender pearlscan be used, but they teleport the player to the entity. Snowballs can be obtained from miningsnow, while eggs are occasionally laid as items bychickens.

- Wind charges‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE]deal 1on contact with a mob and heavy knockback to nearby entities. They can also interact with certainredstone components. Wind charges can be obtained as a product of grinding breeze rods in a crafting table.

- TNTcan be used to launch other TNT, making it a ranged weapon that requires some setup.

## Other weapons
Other items listed below can be used as weapons but usually have other intended uses and should be used strategically.

- TNTis capable of causing a largeexplosionwhen lit using fire, but has a long delay before the explosion, so it must be timed well to be used properly.

- End crystals,respawn anchors, andbedsare capable of causing massive explosions, but are also very situational. Beds and respawn anchors only explode when used in the wrong dimension (anywhere except the Overworld and Nether, respectively). End crystals can only be placed onobsidianorbedrock. Beds and respawn anchors mainly allow the player to respawn at their positions in their respective dimensions, and end crystals can also be used to resurrect theender dragon.

- Flint and steelandfire chargescan lightfires, which can be used to deal great amounts of damage. Most mobs native to the Nether are immune to this.

- Lava bucketscan be used to placelava, which deals great amounts of fire damage and slows down entities inside it, rendering it one of the most powerful weapons in an arsenal. Most mobs native to the Nether are immune to this.

- Redstonetraps can be used to kill the entity with all sorts of environmental damage, ranging from fall damage to suffocation to anything in between, but these must be prepared beforehand, so they oftentimes cannot be used in conventional combat.

- Anvilscan deal massive damage to entities they fall onto, and also deal heavy damage to helmets regardless of if they land a lethal hit. However, these must be prepared beforehand, so they are more useful as traps than weapons. They also take damage when they land, so they can only be used as weapons a limited amount of times, so they must be used sparingly. Anvils are mainly used as repair stations that can also combine enchantments.

- Pointed dripstonecan be dropped onto an entity like an anvil to deal damage, and can also deal double fall damage if an entity falls onto it.

- Cobwebsgreatly slow all entities inside them, which can be used strategically to gain a massive advantage. They do not, however, do anything toarthropods.

- Someblockscause damage on contact, and can be used as obstacles to hinder mobs and other players. These includecacti,sweet berry bushes,wither roses(if target is not immune toWither),campfires(if target is not immune to fire), andmagma blocks(if the target isn'tsneaking, wearingFrost Walkerboots, or is immune to fire).

- Hostile mobscan also be used as weapons, especially since some mobs can be manipulated easily. However, these mobs tend to attack any player without provocation, and there are also certain groups of mobs that do not attack each other even if provoked. Great care must be taken if hostile mobs are to be used as weapons.
	- Afireballshot by aghastcan be deflected. It has an explosive effect and sets its surroundings on fire upon impact.
