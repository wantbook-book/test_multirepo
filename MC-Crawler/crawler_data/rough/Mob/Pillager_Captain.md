## Spawning
Raid captains spawn in the same conditions and occurrences of any illager, with no special occasions having one spawn, and one spawning being completely randomized. In Bedrock Edition, a pillager raid captain can be spawned using the /summon pillager ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_as_illager_captain command, and a vindicator raid captain can be spawned using /summon vindicator ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_as_illager_captain command. 

Additionally, in Java Edition, monster spawners containing a pillager spawn egg have a small chance of producing a raid captain.

### Patrols
Main article: Patrol
One pillager raid captain always spawns as part of a patrol.

### Raids
Main article: Raid
As part of raids in Java Edition, a raid captain spawns as a part of a group of pillagers, and sometimes spawns riding a ravager. The captain does not cause another raid if killed, but when its banner drops, other illagers rush to grab it.
In Bedrock Edition, raid captains are unused and do not spawn naturally during raids, but the code for them is present.[verify]

### Pillager outposts
Main article: Pillager Outpost § Spawning
Usually, 1–3 pillager raid captains also spawn in a pillager outpost.

In Java Edition, only pillagers and passive mobs may spawn within a pillager outpost spawn area.  Pillagers may spawn on any valid opaque block as long as the block light level is 8 or lower.

## Drops
### General
Upon death, any raid captain can drop:

- 1Ominous banner, unaffected byLootingand is always dropped.
- 1Ominous Bottle‌[upcoming: JE 1.21]

#### Pillager
- 0–2arrows, dropping more with the presence ofLooting, up to 5‌[Bedrock Edition  only].
- Itscrossbow(may be loaded or unloaded), which has an 8.5% chance to be dropped (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III). It has a random durability and may be enchanted.

#### Vindicator
- 0–1emeralds, with the maximum increasing by 1 for every level ofLooting.
- Itsiron axe, which has an 8.5% chance to be dropped (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III). It has a random durability and may be enchanted.

#### Evoker
- 1totem of undying, unaffected by Looting.
- 0–1emeralds if killed by the player, with the maximum increased by 1 per level of Looting.

#### Illusioner
- Itsbow, which has an 8.5% chance to be dropped (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III). It has a random durability and is unenchanted.

### Raider
In Bedrock Edition, raid captains that spawn from raids can additionally drop:

- 0–1emeralds

An additional drop is dependent on difficulty, with a 65% chance of dropping on easy and normal, and an 80% chance of dropping on hard.
They can drop one of the following items:

- 0–1Emerald(10⁄39chance)
- 2–3Emerald(5⁄39chance)
- 4–5Emerald(2⁄39chance)
- 1Enchanted Book(2⁄39chance)
- 1Iron Pickaxe(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Axe(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Shovel(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Sword(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Helmet(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Chestplate(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Leggings(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Boots(5⁄78chance)

Note:

- Raiders drop iron equipment in a damaged state, and the equipment has 50% chance of being enchanted with random enchantment.
- These drops are also affected byLootingenchantment.
- An emerald is both a regular raider drop and an additional raider drop.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

## Behavior
### Java Edition
Raid captains usually act the same as if they were a normal illager, but other illagers follow behind them (except for outpost captain), and usually the captain takes the lead ahead of the other illagers. Once a raid captain is killed by a player, the player is inflicted with 1 level of the Bad Omen effect, which can cause a raid to occur if they enter a village (unless the raid captain is currently part of a raid, in which case it does not give Bad Omen).‌[until JE 1.21] The captain drops its  ominous banner as well; another illager nearby can pick it up to become the next captain. 

Both patrol and outpost captains grant one level of Bad Omen when killed, but captains found in raids themselves never give Bad Omen.‌[until JE 1.21]

### Bedrock Edition
Raid captains have the same behavior in Bedrock Edition as they do in Java Edition, but the maximum level of Bad Omen raid captains can give is one level, as Bad Omen I is the only level available. If a player with Bad Omen kills another raid captain, the Bad Omen level remains at one and the effect timer does not reset.
