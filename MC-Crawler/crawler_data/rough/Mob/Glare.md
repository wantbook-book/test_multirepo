# Glare
The glare was a proposed mob featured in the Mob Vote during Minecraft Live 2021, alongside the allay and copper golem.[1]

It would have flown to areas dark enough for hostile mobs to spawn in, and then would have become grumpy to alert the player of this.[2] It may have helped light up these areas as well.[3]

The glare lost the vote with only 11.2% of the votes; the allay won.
