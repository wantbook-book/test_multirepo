# Tool
A tool is an item used by the player while held to perform actions faster and more efficiently, to gather materials not obtainable by hand, or to perform completely new actions. In Java Edition, one of the tabs in Creative inventory is called "Tools & Utilities": items from this tab with durability are considered tools, and other items are considered utilities. Tools don't stack in the inventory and can be repaired; see Item repair.

## Usage
### Best tools
Main article: Breaking
Many blocks have a preferred tool to break them: this preferred tool can be a pickaxe, shovel, axe, hoe, or shears. Some blocks can be obtained only by breaking them with certain tools. The tool's material also affects how fast a block is mined and what it drops. Materials from worst to best in terms of mining speed are: wooden, stone, iron, diamond, netherite, gold; also see Tiers.

### Item durability
Main article: Durability
Different tools have different amounts of durability. Some uses require more durability to be used than others. A tool's durability is also affected by its material. Materials from worst to best in terms of durability are: gold, wooden, stone, iron, diamond, netherite.

Some tools are not block-breaking tools: this includes a fishing rod, carrot on a stick, warped fungus on a stick, flint and steel, brush and elytra. Such tools are no better than bare fists at breaking blocks, but they do not take damage from doing so; they take damage from being used in their own intended manners. All block-breaking tools, excluding pickaxes, also have other uses than just breaking blocks: for example, shovels can create dirt paths, axes can be used to strip logs and wood, hoes can till soil and create farmland, and shears can be used to shear sheep. All of these actions also consume tool's durability.

### Item enchantability
Some tools can be enchanted in the enchanting table: these include pickaxes, shovels, axes, hoes and the fishing rod. Other tools can receive enchantments only through the use of an anvil and enchanted books. Materials from worst to best in terms of enchantability are: stone, diamond, iron, wooden/netherite, gold.

### Smelting
Main article: Smelting
Iron or golden tools can be smelted into nuggets.
