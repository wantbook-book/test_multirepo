## Spawning
A plains zombie villager with an enchanted iron sword.
When a group in the normal spawn cycle spawns zombies, there is a 5% chance to instead spawn a group of zombie villagers‌[Bedrock Edition  only], or a single zombie villager.‌[Java Edition  only]

If any type of zombie kills a villager, there is a chance for the villager to transform into a zombie villager.

| Difficulty | Chance |
|------------|--------|
| Easy       | 0%     |
| Normal     | 50%    |
| Hard       | 100%   |

In Java Edition a zombified zombie villager does not despawn if the player has traded with it at least once prior to its death, but unlike all other persistent mobs it still counts toward the hostile mob cap. If the zombie villager picks up any item however, it remains persistent but is excluded from the mob cap. In Bedrock Edition all zombified villagers are persistent.

A zombie villager appears alongside a cleric villager in every igloo basement (a normal zombie villager in Bedrock Edition and a cleric zombie villager in Java Edition). One of them transforms into a leatherworker, due to the workstation (a cauldron). They also generate as part of abandoned villages. Zombie villagers generated in both of these structures do not despawn naturally.

## Variants
### Baby zombies
All mobs that can be ridden by baby zombie villagers in Bedrock Edition.
Baby zombie villagers make up 5% of zombie villager spawns. They have big heads, unlike normal baby villagers in Java Edition. They behave similarly to regular zombie villagers, with the following differences:

- They are 30% faster than normalzombies, yet they have the samehealthas normal zombies. This makes baby zombie villagers more dangerous than their bigger counterparts.
- The noises they make are higher-pitched than adult zombie villagersoundeffects.
- InJava Edition, baby zombie villagers have a chance to spawn as achicken jockey.
- InBedrock Edition, 15% of naturally spawned baby zombie villagers can start riding a mob and become a jockey when it tries attacking avillager, player, orgolem. They can ride:

- Adultchickens
- Untamedocelots
- Untamedcats
- Untamedwolves
- Adultzombies
- Adulthusks
- Adultzombified villagers
- Adultzombified piglins
- Cows
- Adult unsaddledpigs
- Sheep
- Adult untamedhorses
- Adult untameddonkeys
- Adult untamedmules
- Adultskeleton horses
- Adultzombie horses
- Mooshrooms
- Spidersthat was not spawned as a jockey mount
- Cave spidersthat was not spawned as a jockey mount
- Pandas

Baby zombie villagers turn into baby villagers, if cured. In Java Edition, their heads turn back to small baby villager heads.[1]
Worn armor shrinks to fit their body size.
They are able to fit through 1×1 block gaps.
They drop 12 experience when killed by the player instead of 5.
Unlike other baby mobs but like undead baby mobs, they stay as babies indefinitely and never grow into "adult" zombie villagers.
They have a decreased hitbox size.
Baby zombie villagers are spawned when a zombie kills a baby villager, the chance of infection being the same as adult zombie villagers. Baby zombie villagers also spawn naturally, but the combined chance (5% villagers × 5% babies) is low at 0.25% (or 1 in 400 chance) of all newly spawned zombies.

### Armed zombie villagers
Along with skeletons and regular zombies, some zombie villagers are capable of picking up dropped items. These zombie villagers automatically pick up and hold any item that they come across (except jack o'lanterns‌[Java Edition  only], mob heads and pumpkins, as these are worn on their heads), and use any armor, weapons, or tools picked up. If they encounter another similar item, they pick it up and drop their previous item:

- if the newitemisarmoror a sword and the old item was not (for example, zombie villagers preferswordstopickaxesandhelmetstopumpkins),
- if both items are armor/swords and the new item is better damage-wise (reduces more damage for armor, or inflicts more damage for swords),
- if both items are armor/swords with the same damage reduction/infliction, the new item has NBT tags while the old does not or the new item ismoredamagedthan the old item, or
- if both items are bows and the new item has NBT tags while the old does not.

Items dropped by mobs in exchange for another cannot be picked up by players or mobs for 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag), but can be picked up by hoppers.

Armor worn by zombie villagers is not damaged from most damage sources, which means it cannot "wear out" the way player armor does. Helmets (not blocks like pumpkins) on zombie villagers can wear away and break if the zombie villager is exposed to daylight, or has an anvil or other falling block dropped on its head. Zombie villagers also have a natural armor rating of 2 (), which gives 1.6 - 8% damage reduction from most sources.

Some zombie villagers that are capable of picking up items spawn already in possession of such items, and those items may also be enchanted. The chances of that event are listed below. If a zombie villager spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (i.e. all pieces are made of the same material).

|                            | Easy | Normal         | Hard               |

1. ↑ a b c d e f g h iValue is based on the regional difficulty.
2. ↑ a bEnchantment is the same as on an enchantment table at level 5–22.[note 1]
3. ↑1⁄3 chance of an iron sword, 2⁄3 chance of an iron shovel

If a zombie does spawn with armor, the chances of specific armor are as follows:

| Armor                          | Easy & Normal | Hard  |
|--------------------------------|---------------|-------|
| Helmet                         | 100%          | 100%  |
| Helmet & Chestplate            | 75%           | 90%   |
| Helmet & Chestplate & Leggings | 56.25%        | 81%   |
| Full set                       | 42.19%        | 72.9% |

The chances of it being of a particular material are:

| Armor Type | Chance |
|------------|--------|
| Leather    | 37.06% |
| Gold       | 48.73% |
| Chain      | 12.90% |
| Iron       | 1.27%  |
| Diamond    | 0.04%  |

Any zombie villager that spawns with equipment‌[Java Edition  only] (picked-up items don't count) drop 1–3 extra experience per item.

### Villager variants
A zombie villager retains its biome and profession after conversion from a villager. They also retain their trades. Below is a table of the variant and what workstation it required before zombification. The zombie villager cannot work at a job site block. 

Below is a table listing the various professions, along with the specific job site block that each profession requires:

1. ↑ a b cDropped only when kill credit is given to the player
2. ↑Dropped as baked potato if on fire when killed.

Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping on death or when cured and drops with the same damage level it had when picked up.

### Naturally-spawned equipment
Zombie villagers do not spawn with equipment in Bedrock Edition. In Java Edition, a zombie villager can spawn with any of the following:

- Carved Pumpkin[note 1]
- Jack o'Lantern‌[Java Edition  only][note 1]
- Iron Shovel
- Iron Sword
- Random Armor
- Zombie villagers have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment (other than Halloween pumpkins), and drop it with a random durability. Each level ofLootingincreases the chance by 1 percentage point (11.5% with Looting III).

1. ↑ a bZombie villagers spawn with pumpkins and jack o'lanterns‌[Java Edition  only] only during Halloween.

### Experience
Adult zombie villagers drop 5 and an additional 1–3 per naturally-spawned equipment. Baby zombie villagers drop 12 experience.

## Behavior
Main article: Zombie § Behavior
Zombie villagers behave as ordinary zombies, except that they do not convert to drowned when submerged.

Zombie villagers that were converted from villagers retain their professions and clothes, which gain a tattered appearance. Naturally spawned zombie villagers (or ones spawned with spawn eggs) have a random profession, and can also spawn with unemployed or nitwit outfits. In Bedrock Edition, baby zombie villagers are always unemployed.

Being an undead mob, they are: 

- damaged by the status effectInstant Healthand healed by the status effectInstant Damage.
- unaffected by the status effectsRegenerationandPoison.
- ignored by thewither.
- affected by theSmiteenchantment.
- a threat toarmadillos, causing them to hide in their shell.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80]

### Curing
See also: Tutorials/Curing a zombie villager

Zombie villagers can be cured (converted to normal villagers) by first giving them the Weakness effect, which can be applied by:

- Asplash potionof Weakness thrown by theplayer, adispenser, or awitch.
- Alingering potionof Weakness thrown by the player or a dispenser.
- Anarrow of Weakness.
- Anarea effect cloudcaused by an explosion of acreeperinflicted with a Weakness effect.‌[Java Edition  only].
- The/effectcommand, if cheats are enabled.

The weakened zombie villager must then be healed by using a (non-enchanted) golden apple on them. The zombie villager begins to shudder to signal that curing is in progress. Also, the Weakness effect is removed, replaced by Strength for the duration of the curing process. An internal countdown timer is then started, counting down the total time to cure.

Time to cure is initially a random integer between 3600 and 6000 ticks (180 to 300 seconds, 3—5 minutes). On each tick, there is a 1% chance for the game to look for cure accelerants. It checks each block within a 9×9×9 cube centered on the villager for either an iron bar or a bed (either half: they're detected separately). For each one found up to 14, there is a 30% chance of decreasing the countdown timer by 1 more tick. Therefore, having at least 14 half-beds and/or iron bars within range speeds up conversion by an average of 4.2%.[2]

During the curing process the zombie villager behaves like a normal zombie except that it gains Strength (with a potency that doesn't depend on the difficulty level). Thus, a zombie villager is more dangerous during curing than at other times.

At the end of the curing process, the zombie villager transforms into a villager and gains the Nausea effect for 10 seconds (which has no effect on the villager's behavior). If it was holding any item it picked up, that item is dropped (unless it was enchanted with Curse of Binding, in which case it remains in the villager's inventory but is not worn and does not drop if the villager is killed). If it was a baby before it was transformed into a zombie villager, it remains a baby after the cure. If it had traded with a player at least once, it recovers its former profession and inventory of trades. Otherwise, it recovers its profession but might immediately change it if it finds and claims a workstation block for a different profession.

A newly-cured villager, if it had a profession prior to being zombified, offers a trading discount to the player who administered the cure. These discounts are permanent. If a villager is cured more than once, no additional discounts are applied. Villagers near the cured villager are also affected but offer fewer, smaller discounts.

Zombie villagers that are in the process of converting do not despawn if the player moves far away from them, but like all monsters, they despawn if the difficulty is changed to Peaceful.

### Specific to Java Edition
- If a zombie villager spawned as a nitwit or was a nitwit before it was transformed into a zombie villager, it remains a nitwit if cured.
- Naturally spawned zombie villagers become unemployed, and may gain a different profession than the one they had while zombified.
- Curing a villager spreadsminor_positivegossip through the villagergossipsystem.

### Specific to Bedrock Edition
- A former nitwit zombie villager becomes an unemployed villager and can learn a profession after the cure.
- Villagers in a range of 16 blocks in a cube surrounding the cured villager also offer a small discount proportional to the number of cured villagers (up to 10).
- Saving and reloading the world causes the curing process to finish as soon as the chunk containing the villager is ticked. This does not happen if the player moves out of range, then returns: In that case, the countdown timer pauses until the player returns.
