## Behavior
An ominous item spawner displays an item rotating in the air for a specified amount of time. When spawned by a ominous trial spawner, that time varies between 3 and 6 seconds. After that time, the item is dispensed downwards. If the item is a projectile, it is shot as an entity. Otherwise the item is dropped.
