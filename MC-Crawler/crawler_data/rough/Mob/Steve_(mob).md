## Spawning
Mobs would generate in random places when a world was generated at Pre-classic. Later, they could be manually spawned by pressing G while playing in Classic mode. After approximately 1 minute, they would despawn. After both of these features were removed, they were only spawnable using mods and map editors, but otherwise were not available in vanilla Minecraft.

## Drops
The Human and Rana did not drop anything when they die.

Steve drops 0-2 string when killed.

Black Steve drops 0-2 gunpowder when killed.

Beast Boy Drops 0-2 feathers when killed.

## Behavior
The animation of the mob walking.
Mobs could not change blocks; they would just move around the map aimlessly, walking in slightly imperfect circles and jumping occasionally. While walking, they would flail their arms around and move their head randomly. Mobs were affected by solid blocks, but they were able to walk right through liquids, as if they were air. If the player had a custom skin, any mobs created would still use the default skin and would not assume the look of the player. They would not notice dangers, and because of this they would sometimes jump into the void.
