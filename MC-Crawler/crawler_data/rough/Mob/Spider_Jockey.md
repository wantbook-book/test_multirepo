## Spawning
There is a 1% chance for a spider to spawn with a skeleton riding it.

Spider jockeys spawned in narrow enclosures can cause the skeleton rider to die of suffocation, due to the spider scaling the walls. They can also spawn in a 1-block tall space with a transparent block above, so the skeleton is stuck in the transparent block.

Like the regular mobs, the skeleton can spawn with armor and/or an enchanted bow, and, in Java Edition, the spider has a chance to spawn with a status effect. See Skeleton#Geared skeletons and Spider#Status effects for details.

Spider jockey spawned with the skeleton's head inside glass.
In Bedrock Edition, baby zombie variants can mount spiders and cave spiders. See Zombie for details.

## Behavior
Main article: Riding
The skeleton is still able to shoot arrows, but can't walk on its own because it is riding the spider. Also, the spider and the skeleton cannot attack each other, but they can attack players and other mobs. The spider can still climb and walk at its normal speed and is not weighed down by the skeleton.

In Java Edition, the spider does not attack any entity, and the movement of the spider jockey is controlled by the skeleton.
