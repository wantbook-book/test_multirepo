# Tuff Golem
The tuff golem was a proposed mob featured in the Mob Vote during Minecraft Live 2022, alongside the sniffer and rascal.[1] It was a golem that would have been built by the player. If a wool block was included while building it, the tuff golem would have worn a cloak matching the color of the wool. 

The tuff golem was a statue that would have held and displayed any item and, when awoken, would have moved around while holding the item or picked up an item if it was not holding one. The tuff golem would have returned back to the spot that it woke up from before turning back into a statue. The tuff golem would have been one block tall so players could stack them.[2]

The tuff golem lost the vote with only 17.2% of the votes.
