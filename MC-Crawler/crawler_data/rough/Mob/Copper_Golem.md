# Copper Golem
The copper golem was a proposed mob featured in the Mob Vote during Minecraft Live 2021, alongside the allay and glare.[1] It was a golem that would have been created with copper. It would have been attracted to copper buttons, which would also come with the golem had it won.[2]

The copper golem would have the oxidation removed with either an axe,[3] or being struck by lightning.[4] It would also have turned into a statue at full oxidation.[5]

The copper golem lost the final round of vote with 45.7% of the votes.
