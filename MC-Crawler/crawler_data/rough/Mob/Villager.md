# Villager
Villagers are passive mobs that inhabit villages, work at their professions, breed, and interact with each other. Their outfit varies according to their occupation and biome. A player can trade with them using emeralds as currency.

## Spawning
### Natural generation
Villagers can be found in villages, which spawn in several biomes such as plains, snowy plains, savannas, deserts, taigas, and snowy taigas‌[Bedrock Edition  only] and can cut into other biomes such as swamps and jungles. When the village is generated, unemployed villagers spawn in them, the number of which depends on the buildings in that village, as some buildings generate villagers inside and some do not.

A cleric villager and cleric zombie villager spawn locked up in the basements of igloos (if the basement generates) under the carpet of the floor. In Bedrock Edition, the villager and zombie villager inside igloo basements have random professions instead of always being clerics. The cleric villager can also turn into a leatherworker villager since the cauldron in the basement is closer to the villager.

### Curing
See also: Zombie Villager § Curing

Giving a zombie villager the Weakness effect and then feeding it a golden apple starts the curing process. After five minutes, it transforms into a villager, displaying purple Nausea status effect particles for 10 seconds after being cured. The villager retains the profession it had as a zombie, if it had one before turning into a zombie villager. In Bedrock Edition, if the zombie villager is player spawned, it adopts a randomly chosen profession. The villager can also be a nitwit, as the game counts it as a "profession" but the nitwit villager still can't work. If employed, the cured villager offers discounts on most of its trades.

## Drops
A villager, either adult or baby, does not ordinarily drop any items or experience when killed. However, when a player holds an emerald or other item a villager is willing to trade for, the item it offers in trade appears in its hands, alternating between items if there are multiple items the villager wants to trade.

Upon successful trading, a villager drops 3–6.

Upon successful trading, while willing to breed, 8–11 is dropped.

### Hero of the Village
Main article: Hero of the Village
A villager can drop various items, depending on its profession, by throwing a gift toward a nearby player with the Hero of the Village effect. The gift is randomly selected from a list of items for the villager's individual profession, and there is a random cooldown before the villager can throw another gift.

## Behavior
### Movement patterns
#### Socializing
Nitwit and unemployed villagers leave their homes at day and begin to explore the village. Generally, they wander inside the village during the day. They may go indoors or outdoors, periodically making mumbling sounds. Occasionally, two villagers may stop and turn to look at each other, in a behavior called socializing, during which they stare at another villager for 4–5 seconds at a time. They continuously stare at a nearby player unless the villager is trying to get into a house at night, farm food, work, or flee from a zombie or illager. Baby villagers may jump on beds and play tag with each other, similarly to how baby piglins and baby hoglins play tag.

In Bedrock Edition, baby villagers do not stop in order to stare at players, and thus continue moving as if the player is not there.

A villager tries not to travel far from its bed in a large village unless the job site or the nearest gossip site (bell) is far away.

Villagers emit green particles if they join a village, set a bed or acquire a job site/profession.

Villagers run inside at night or during rain, closing doors behind them. They attempt to sleep at night, but if they cannot claim a bed, they stay indoors near a bed until morning. In the morning, they head outside and resume normal behavior. However, some villagers, such as nitwits, stay outside later than others unless being chased by an illager or zombie.

#### Migration
If a villager finds itself outside the village boundary, or a villager without a village detects a village boundary within 32 blocks, it moves quickly back within the boundary. A villager taken more than 32 blocks away from its village boundary forgets the village within about 6 seconds. Whether in a village or not, a villager never despawns.

#### Pathfinding
Villagers, like other mobs, can find paths around obstructions, avoid walking off cliffs of heights greater than 3 blocks, and avoid some blocks that cause harm. However, in crowded situations, one villager can push another off a cliff or into harm's way.

Villagers can open all wooden doors and find paths to blocks of interest behind the doors. However, they cannot open any trapdoors, fence gates, or iron doors. Villagers can climb ladders, but do not recognize them as paths and do not deliberately use them. Any climbing of ladders seems to be a side effect of them being pushed into the block by another mob (usually by other villagers).

#### Stranded villagers
Climbing a ladder can leave a villager stranded on the second floor and roof of some village structures, as they lack the necessary AI to intentionally descend ladders.[verify] A simple fix for these situations is for the player to manually push the villager back toward the ladder hole. Then the player can place a wooden trapdoor at the top, to stop the villager from ever getting up there again. However, the villager can still get stuck on the ladder underneath the trapdoor. Another solution is to break the first ladder touching the ground, completely preventing the villager from climbing the ladder. However, this means the player has to jump up one block to use the ladder.

#### Getting attacked
Villagers flee from zombies, zombie villagers, husks, drowned, zombified piglins ‌[Bedrock Edition  only], zoglins, vindicators, pillagers (even if their crossbow has been broken), ravagers, and vexes within 8 blocks, and evokers and illusioners within 12 blocks. Like other passive mobs, villagers sprint away when attacked. Villagers do not run away from skeletons (and their variants), spiders, or cave spiders since these hostile mobs are passive toward villagers, although a skeleton arrow might hit a villager by accident.

##### Preferred path

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition. 


When pathfinding, villagers prefer to stay on low cost blocks, such as dirt paths, cobblestone, bricks, and planks. They do this by trying to minimize the path cost of all of the blocks they walk across. They also avoid jumping, because it has a high path cost, but babies don't avoid it as much.

### Job site blocks
For a list of job site blocks and the professions they are required for, see  § Professions.

Unemployed villagers (other than babies and nitwits) seek employment at job site blocks (also referred to as workstations), and employed villagers use job site blocks to refresh their trades (see § Working). Villagers who have made their first trade must claim a site block that corresponds with their profession, whereas tradeless villagers may change their profession to match a site block. 

In Java Edition, an unemployed villager claims job site blocks by searching for the nearest unclaimed site in a 48-block sphere. When a suitable site block is detected, the villager starts pathfinding to it, staking a provisional claim. This can occur only while the villager is awake. A provisional claim is released if the villager cannot reach the block within 60 seconds, however the villager may try again immediately.[1] To fully claim the site and change profession, the villager must approach within a 2-block radius of the job site's center. When a job site block is fully claimed, its owner emits green particles, and no other villager can claim the block unless the owner relinquishes it. 

In Bedrock Edition, all villagers in a village search for unclaimed job sites in a 16 block radius and 4 block height. If a site block is found, it is added to a shared list of valid job site blocks for the whole village. An unemployed villager with a bed claims the first site block on that list and immediately acquires the profession to match, regardless of the distance or accessibility to the site block.[2] The villager can even claim the site block while sleeping. When a job site block is claimed, both the block and the villager making the claim emit green particles and the site block is removed from the list. If a villager cannot pathfind to its claimed site, both the site block and villager emit anger particles. The site block may need to be broken before the villager unclaims it.[verify]

### Gossiping
Villagers can store memories about players in the form of gossip. These get spread to other villagers whenever they talk with each other. Each piece of gossip is one of five types, and it stores a value as well as a target. Gossips generate and increase in value as a result of various player actions. The target is the player who caused the gossip. Together the gossip values determine a player's reputation with each villager, which influence trading prices and the hostility of naturally spawned iron golems.

| Type           | Caused by | Amount gained | Decay | Share penalty | Max value | Reputation multiplier |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|-------|---------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| Major positive | Curing    | 20            | 0     | 100           | 20        | 5                     |
| Minor positive | Curing    | 25            | 1     | 5             | 200       | 1                     |
| Minor negative | Attacking | 25            | 20    | 20            | 200       | -1                    |
| Major negative | Killing   | 25            | 10    | 10            | 100       | -5                    |
| Trade          | Trading   | 2             | 2     | 20            | 25        | 1                     |

Trading with or curing a villager increase the value of the corresponding gossips for the targeted villager only. When a villager is attacked or killed, however, it instead generates the major negative gossip in every other villager it could see (eye-to-eye line of sight) inside a box extending 16 blocks from the villager in all coordinate directions.

When a piece of gossip is shared, it is received at a lower value than the sharer has it. Gossips also decay a certain amount (see Decay column) every 20 minutes. Since major positive gossip have a share penalty equal to its max value and a decay of 0, it cannot be shared and never decays.

A player's total reputation with a villager is determined by multiplying each gossip's value by its respective multiplier and adding the results together. For example, if a player has recently cured a villager for the first time but also attacked the villager twice, their reputation with that villager would be 5×20 + 25 - 50 = 75. After 40 minutes the gossips have decayed twice, making the player's reputation 5×20 + 23 - 10 = 113.

The prices of a villager's trades all get reduced by reputation times the price multiplier rounded down, meaning that a positive reputation lowers prices but a negative reputation increase them. The price multiplier is either 0.05 or 0.2 depending on the item, see trading. Prices can not get lower than 1 or higher than the item's stack size. The exact function to calculate the price affected by the gossips is y = x - floor((5a + b + c - d - 5e) × p), Where y is the final price, x is the base price, a is the value of major_positive, b is the value of minor_positive, c is the value of trading, d is the value of minor_negative, e is the value of major_negative, and p is the value of PriceMultiplier.

An iron golem that was not built by a player becomes hostile toward all players whose reputation with any nearby villager is -100 or lower. The golem checks all villagers inside a box centered on the golem and extending 10 blocks in every horizontal direction and 8 blocks in both vertical directions.

Players can set villagers on fire using flint and steel or lava without affecting gossips. The same is true for TNT activated by redstone or a dispenser. However, TNT ignited directly by a player (using flint and steel, fire charges or flaming arrows) does generate gossip for damaged or killed villagers, because the TNT's damage is attributed to the player.

### Picking up items
Each villager has eight hidden inventory slots, which start empty whenever the villager is spawned. A villager can fill all of its inventory slots with items it picks up.

The villager does not intentionally seek out items to pick up, but it does collect any bread, carrots, potatoes, wheat, wheat seeds, beetroot, beetroot seeds, torchflower seeds, pitcher pods, and bone meal that happen to be in range. The listed items are the only items villagers can pick up, although the the /item replace command can put any arbitrary item into a villager's inventory. Also, bone meal can be picked up only by a farmer villager.

If a player and a villager are in the pickup range of an item at the same time, the player always picks it up first. If several villagers are next to an item, the same one picks up the item every time. This behavior prevents villagers from effectively sharing food (and thus breeding) in a small space.

When killed or converted to a zombie villager, any inventory item of the villager is lost, even when /gamerule keepInventory is set to true.

If /gamerule mobGriefing is false, villagers cannot pick up items, and farmer villagers cannot plant or harvest crops.

Like other mobs, villagers have four slots for worn armor, separate from their inventory slots. An adjacent dispenser can equip armor, elytra, mob heads or carved pumpkins to a villager, but the armor is not rendered (except for carved pumpkins and mob heads). The equipment functions as normal; for example, a villager wearing an armor piece enchanted with Thorns can inflict Thorns damage to attackers, and a villager wearing Frost Walker boots is able to create frosted ice. If a villager is converted into a zombie villager, the armor it was wearing is dropped, though it may be able to pick it up and equip it again.

### Sharing food
Villagers sharing carrots.
In Java Edition, villagers collect bread, carrots, potatoes, beetroots, wheat seeds, beetroot seeds, and wheat. If a villager has at least 24 of these items, it gives the extra amount to a villager with 4 or fewer of each these food items. That other villager can also do this until all villagers have shared all items they could (for example, on a group of three villagers one receives 60 bread, then it shares 36 to another villager to keep 24[3], and that same villager then shares 12 to the third villager).

In the case of wheat, villagers have a rather distinct behavior. They do the same as other crops, but if a villager has at least 32 wheat, it tries to give half of it to another villager, making both have 16 wheat.

If a villager has 8 full [more information needed] stacks of any kind of food or seeds and then tries to share with another villager, it leaves at least 24 items in each stack. Thus it can never really empty its inventory down to 0 and clear a slot to pick up other stuff, unless it uses the items when trying to breed or when farming if it is a farmer villager.[4][5] A bait villager can be used in a farm taking advantage of this mechanic to have a farmer villager collect and deposit crops.

In Bedrock Edition, if a villager has enough food in one inventory stack (6 bread or 24 carrots, potatoes, beetroots, or 18 wheat for farmers only) and sees a villager without enough food in one inventory stack (3 bread, 12 carrots, 12 potatoes, or 12 beetroots for non-farmers; 15 bread, 60 carrots, 60 potatoes, or 60 beetroots, or 45 wheat for farmers), the villager may decide to share food with that villager.

To share, a villager finds its first inventory stack with at least 4 bread, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot or with at least 6 wheat, and then throws half the stack (rounded down) in the direction of the target villager. When wheat is shared, it is first crafted to bread, which may result in 1 or 2 less than half the stack being shared.

### Farming
Farmer villager picking and planting carrots.
In Java Edition, during the "work" portion of their schedule farmers tend nearby crops. 

- Farmers sometimes move to randomfarmlandblocks they detect within ±4 on the X and Z axes and ±2 on the Y axis, rather than going to their jobsite.
- If there are fully-grown crop blocks or air above farmland within ±1 of the villager on each axis, the farmer spends 10 seconds tending them (not counting time spend walking to the next block), one per second. The block is harvested if necessary and (re-)planted if the farmer has any seeds.
	- If/gamerule mobGriefingisfalse, villagers cannot farm.
	- Harvesting is done regardless of the villager's current inventory, even if they lack space to pick up the results.
	- Planting is done as from the first eligible inventory slot.
- If there is at least one non-fully-grown crop block within ±1 of the farmer on each axis, the farmer hasbone meal, and it has been at least 8 seconds since the farmer last did some fertilization, then the farmer fertilizes up to four crop blocks (one every two seconds).
- When the farmer works at their composter, it composts excess wheat and beetroot seeds, and extracts bone meal if it is full. Up to 20 seeds are composted in one work session, but at least 10 of each type of seed are first kept. Inventory slots are checked in reverse order.

In Bedrock Edition, farmers tend crops within the village boundary. Villagers far enough outside the boundary of any village also tend nearby crops. Farmland to be tended is found by seeking for certain blocks up to 9 blocks away from the villager in the X and Z coordinates and up to 1 away in the Y coordinate (a 19×19×3 volume total).

- If a farmer villager does not have enough food in one stack in its inventory (15 bread, 60 carrots, 60 potatoes, 60 beetroots, or 45 wheat) and finds fully-grown wheat, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot, the villager moves to the crop block and harvests it.
- If a farmer villager has any seeds, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot seeds in its inventory and finds an air block above farmland, the villager moves to it and plants a crop. They always plant from the first eligible slot in their inventory.
- Farmer villagers use and pick upbone meal. They also fill theircomposterwithseeds.
- Farmer villagers start farming only if a crop is planted on farmland previously.
- Farmer villagers continue to plant on the farmland even if all crops are destroyed.

For both editions,

- Farmer villagerscannotturndirt,grass blocks, ordirt pathsinto farmland, nor they pick up any hoes to till the blocks.
- If a hoe is placed into a farmer villager's mainhand or offhand via commands, they still cannot till any blocks.
- Farmer villagers often share their crops and food with other villagers if they have any extras.

### Breeding
For tutorials on breeding mechanics, see Tutorials/Village mechanics § Breeding and population cap and Tutorials/Legacy Console village mechanics.

Adult villagers breed depending on the time of the day and need to be willing to spawn § Baby villagers, who also require beds with at least 2 empty blocks above the head. Job sites are not required for villagers to breed.

The breeding depends on the number of valid beds. If a villager is "willing" (see § Willingness below), villagers breed as long as there are unclaimed beds available within the limits of the village. All baby villagers are initially unemployed.

In Java Edition, two villagers nearby one another periodically enter mating mode if both have enough food and are not on cooldown. Breeding fails (with anger particles displayed) if no unclaimed bed can be reached via pathfinding within a 48 block radius. The appearance of the child is randomly determined by either the biome type of the parents or by the biome where the breeding occurred.

In Bedrock Edition a census is periodically taken to determine the current population of the village. All villagers within the horizontal boundary of the village are counted as part of the population to determine if continued villager mating is allowed. However, any villager within the horizontal boundary of the village and the spherical boundary of the village attempts to enter mating mode as long as there is at least one villager within the boundary. If two villagers simultaneously enter mating mode while they are close to one another, they breed and produce a child. The appearance is determined by the biome where the breeding occurs in Bedrock Edition.[6]

Two villagers breeding.
#### Willingness
Villagers must be willing to breed. Willingness is determined by the amount of food items a villager has. Becoming willing consumes the villager's food stock, therefore, after mating, villagers cease to be willing until they gather a sufficient stock of food items and breed again.

Villagers must have enough beds within village bounds for baby villagers to spawn. The villager must be able to path-find the bed from their current position. (Note that mobs view slabs as full blocks for pathfinding, so putting upper half slabs above a bed invalidates the bed.)

Villagers can become willing by having either 3 bread, 12 carrots, 12 potatoes, or 12 beetroots in one slot in their inventory. Any villager with an excess of food (usually farmers) throws food to other villagers, allowing them to pick it up and obtain enough food to become willing. The player can also throw bread, carrots, beetroots, or potatoes at the villagers themselves to encourage breeding. Villagers consume the required food upon becoming willing. If /gamerule mobGriefing is false, villagers don't pick up food or break crops.

Some baby villagers in Java Edition. Their heads are smaller than Bedrock Edition or Minecraft Education baby villagers.
### Baby villagers
Baby villagers sprint around, entering and leaving houses at will. They sometimes stop sprinting to stare at other villagers,‌[Java Edition  only] the player, or an iron golem. If the iron golem is holding out a poppy, the children may cautiously take the flower from its hands. This is a reference to the 1986 Japanese animated movie Castle in the Sky, in which a giant robot covered in vines (inspiration for the iron golem) gives the main characters flowers to put on a memorial.[7] Baby villagers tend to group and chase one another around the village as if playing tag. They also jump on beds.

Illagers (except "Johnny" vindicators in Bedrock Edition) ignore baby villagers until they reach adulthood.

Baby villagers give gifts of poppies or wheat seeds to players who have the Hero of the Village effect in Java Edition. 

Baby villagers in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education have a slightly bigger head than in Java Edition; this also can be seen in other baby mobs in the game as well. Java Edition baby villagers don't have too big of a head, so they look like a tiny normal villager.[8]

Baby villagers can fit through 1×1 block gaps.

A baby villager becomes an adult 20 minutes after birth, even when in a boat or a minecart. Baby villagers with no AI do not grow up.

### Lightning
A villager gets struck by lightning.
When lightning strikes within 3–4 blocks of a villager, the villager is replaced by a witch that can't despawn. Even a baby villager that is struck by lightning is turned into a two-block-tall witch. 

Iron golems also attack any villagers that turn into witches.

### Iron golem summoning

Main article: Iron Golem § Villages
In Java Edition, 3 or 5 villagers can summon an iron golem to protect themselves from hostile mobs.

In Bedrock Edition, villagers can summon an iron golem if there are less than 10 villagers per existing golem and the village has at least 20 beds.

### Panicking
Villagers sometimes panic during a raid or a zombie siege by emitting water particles and shaking.

In Java Edition, villagers panic if they see a mob that is hostile toward villagers, like a zombie, zombie villager, husk, drowned, zoglin, illager, vex, wither, or ravager and flee frantically from them, sometimes hiding in houses. In Bedrock Edition, villagers panic by running around in circles around a bed in a village house, such as when a raid happens or when the player rings the village bell. Java Edition villagers in panic are more likely to summon iron golems. To see these mobs, the villager must have an unobstructed line of sight to it (eye-level to eye-level), and be within a certain range (spherical distance between feet center bottom-most point of the villager and hostile mob):

| Mob                                         | Panic radius |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Zombie, husk, drowned, zombie villager, vex | 8            |
| Vindicator, zoglin                          | 10           |
| Evoker, illusioner, ravager                 | 12           |
| Pillager                                    | 15           |

### Zombies
Main articles: Siege and Zombie
Zombies, zombie villagers, husks, and drowned seek out and attack villagers within a 35– to 52.5–block radius (depending on regional difficulty)‌[Java Edition  only] or a 16-block radius‌[Bedrock Edition  only] (even when the villager is invisible). Zombies attempt to break down doors, but only a fraction of zombies can do so and can succeed only when difficulty is set to hard. Zombies who cannot break doors tend to crowd around a door that separates them from a villager. If a zombie or a drowned comes across a set of doors with one open, it usually tries to go through the closed door.

Both zombies and drowned either kill villagers or convert them to zombie villagers. The chance of the villager becoming a zombie villager upon death is 0% on Easy, 50% on Normal, and 100% on Hard. Baby villagers can be infected by zombies as well. Drowned are able to convert villagers to zombie villagers, even when attacking with a trident from a distance.

### Raids
Main article: Raid
During a raid, villagers flee from illagers and run to the nearest house, similar to a zombie siege. For a villager to hide, the house must have a door and at least one bed.

Before the first raid wave in Java Edition, at least one villager rushes to ring the bell in the center of the village (if they are close enough) to warn the other villagers of an incoming raid before going into their house. In Bedrock Edition, the bell rings automatically regardless of whether a villager is nearby. In Java Edition, when a bell is rung, all illagers within 48 blocks get the glowing effect for 3 seconds. 

A villager often stays in the house it first entered, but may exit the house occasionally. The player can still trade with villagers during a raid.

On random occasions, the villager displays water particles as if sweating.

#### Hero of the Village
Main article: Hero of the Village
In Java Edition, once the player gains the Hero of the Village status after defeating a raid, villagers give them a discount for their trades and throw them gifts related to their profession.

### Staring
A lot of villagers staring at the player.
Villagers stare at any player that stares at them, or goes near them. This also applies for some mobs, especially cats. A villager first turns its head toward the player, then the body. Villagers can keep staring at the player unless a raid happens or a zombie comes and chases them off. 

A villager staring at the player.


## Schedules
Villagers have set schedules depending on their age and employment status. Schedules define the villager's goals, which mostly determine how they behave throughout the day. However, their goals can be interrupted by higher priority behaviors most villagers have, such as fleeing from an attack, trading, and getting out of the rain.

### Working
Employed villagers spend most of their day standing next to their job site blocks. From time to time, they "gather supplies" by wandering a short distance away, then returning.

Some professions have additional job-specific goals that are part of their work schedule:

- Farmers harvest and sow crops.
- Librarians inspect bookshelves.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

When a villager reaches its job site block, it commences "work". Two times a day, this action of working resupplies any locked trades. Villagers can resupply twice per day, even without having a bed or while sitting in a minecart. A villager can "reach" its job site block if the block is in any of the 8 directly adjacent or diagonal block spaces horizontally around it at the height of their feet, or at the 9 blocks below that. Villagers can still "reach" them diagonally, even if they can't see or touch the face of the block.

Employed villagers do not breed with each other during their work schedule. Nitwits and the unemployed do not follow this rule as they would breed with each other and the employed villagers.

Leatherworker villagers work at any cauldron; the cauldron does not have to be filled with water in order for the villager to work at it.

### Wandering
All villagers wander from time to time, but for the unemployed and nitwits, they wander for the majority of their day. A wandering villager chooses a random block and walks toward it, then stands there for a variable amount of time before wandering again. If at any time it detects a job site block it can claim, it does so, assumes the skin for the associated profession, and immediately begins following the appropriate schedule.

A villager attempts to claim a job site block by finding a path to a block next to one, showing angry particles when unable to reach it. After a villager fails to reach the job site block several times, it becomes unclaimed, indicated by showing angry particles on it. The villager loses its job site block and eventually becomes unemployed if the villager is at novice-level and no nearby job site block is available. Any other nearby unemployed villager has a chance to become the block's new owner. If there are no unemployed villagers nearby, then the villager who lost the job site block seeks for another unclaimed one or tries to reclaim the same unreachable one in an endless loop (this also happens for claiming beds).

The wander schedule includes a job-specific goal called "exploring the outskirts" that causes villagers to wander near the edges of the village. This enables them to detect new beds, job site blocks, bells, and houses that players have used to extend the village. 

During this time of the day, they may also share items.

### Gathering
Late in the day, adult villagers gather at a meeting place (the area around a bell). When two villagers encounter one another, they mingle (look at each other and "converse" by humming at other villagers). They may also share food, or breed if both are willing.

If a villager isn't close enough to detect a bell, it wanders randomly, searching for one.

### Playing
5 villager children chasing one another.
Baby villagers wander randomly around the village. When they encounter another baby villager, the two of them follow each other for a while and sometimes run as if racing or chasing each other. 

In Java Edition, they sometimes stop to jump and bounce on a bed or to stare at an iron golem they encounter. If the iron golem offers them a poppy, the baby villager cautiously accepts it.

### Returning home
All villagers head home a short time before sunset. They roam around until they get near their beds, then target a block beside the bed. Once they reach their beds, they do not go through a door again before sleeping.

A villager who has no bed simply waits inside a house until morning. This includes players stealing a villager's bed to sleep in, mostly the villager stays in the house and doesn't move until sunrise. But sometimes, if they detect a unclaimed bed nearby they walk out of the house and toward the bed.

A villager pushed on a bed in Java Edition. The villager falls off the bed if it is pushed again.
Dropping an anvil on a villager that is sleeping in Java Edition does not hurt the villager nor causes the villager to wake up.
### Sleeping
A villager sleeping in a bed at night (from the top view).
At sunset, villagers lie down in their beds and remain there until morning. Villagers wake early if food is thrown at them ‌[Java Edition  only], they are pushed out of bed, or if their bed is destroyed. They also wake up when their bed is used, if they are attacked, or when a bell is rung.
If possible, they return to sleeping in a bed after the interruption.

Jumping on a bed with a villager sleeping in it doesn't cause the villager to get up. 

In Java Edition, a villager can be pushed on its bed and sometimes turn its head. A villager can be pushed off a bed,[9] but is most likely to go back to sleeping after staring at the player who pushed the villager for a few seconds. 

When sleeping in Bedrock Edition, a villager's hitbox reduces to a cube restricted to the pillow part of the bed. If an anvil is dropped on the hitbox, the villager takes damage and wakes up. 

In Java Edition, dropping any anvil on a villager that is sleeping causes the anvil to bounce and drop as an item, and the villager remains sleeping and does not take damage. 

A villager who has no bed continues wandering in search of a bed to claim.

Villagers follow their Overworld schedules regardless of which dimension they are in. They can sleep in the Nether or the End, without causing the usual consequences of the bed exploding (See Bed § Sleeping), if the Overworld's time is correct.[10] This is because the daylight cycle continues in these dimensions, even though it is not normally apparent to the player.

Sometimes when a villager gets in a bed from another direction they turn their body until their head is on the pillow of the bed. Villagers also sleep with their eyes open, just like players.

### Healing
A villager gets a brief regeneration effect once leveling up in its profession. Pink regeneration particles appear while it is healing.

In Bedrock Edition, when a villager successfully sleeps, it immediately heals itself when waking up at dawn (if it is damaged).

## Professions
Job site blocks next to each other.
All plains biome variant professions (except unemployed) corresponding to their different job site blocks.
Each villager can have a profession except for the nitwit, indicated by their clothing as well as by the title at the top of the trading interface. A villager can choose their profession by claiming a job site block. When they go to work, they use their daily schedule to get to their claimed job site block. Some professions, like farmers and librarians, do other things. Farmers plant crops, and librarians can inspect bookshelves. If an adult villager does not have a profession (either they are unemployed or a nitwit), they wander instead.

A job site block can be claimed only if it is unclaimed and within a village boundary with at least 1 bed. Removal of a claimed job site block causes the owner to switch to another profession or become unemployed, provided that the villager has no prior trades with the player. If the villager has prior trades, it keeps its profession and claims a new job site block that matches its profession if one is available. So, once a player trades with a villager, the villager keeps its profession forever.

Nitwits and baby villagers cannot change their profession.

In Java Edition, villagers summoned by a spawn egg or via command /summon are always unemployed until they have claimed a job site block. In Bedrock Edition, however, villagers summoned in similar ways have a random profession[11]; their profession can be changed by a job site block, though.

Novice-level villagers who have not yet traded can lose their profession and change into unemployed villagers.

Unemployed adults actively seek for an unclaimed job site block and change into the corresponding profession.

Below is a table listing the various professions, along with the specific job site block that each profession requires:

| Profession                             | Job site block / Workstation | Biome  |                 |        |         |      |           |       |

### Nitwit
A nitwit bobbling its head.‌[Java Edition  only]
Nitwit villagers wear robes that are green on top. They cannot acquire a profession, trade, or gather around bells, but are still able to breed. They are not equipped with a level stone since they cannot trade. Pressing use on a nitwit in Java Edition causes it to grunt and bobble its head at the player. A nitwit must be born or spawned; no villagers change to nitwit from unemployed or a profession, and vice versa. Nitwits can be found naturally or by curing naturally spawned zombie villagers. Zombie villagers can also be spawned as babies, so this is the only way to encounter baby nitwits in survival mode. In Bedrock Edition, every baby villager has a 10% chance to become a nitwit when they become an adult, as well as having a different sleep schedule where they wander around the village for about 2000 ticks (1 minute 40 seconds) after other villagers go to sleep, before seeking a bed. If they can claim a bed, they arise in the morning 2000 ticks after the rest of the village wakes up.

### Appearance
Villagers and zombie villagers have seven skin types corresponding to the biome they spawn in. Their appearance also varies based on their profession and their five tiers. They show which trade tier they have unlocked by a badge of a varying material on their belt. A new tier is obtained every time a player trades with a villager and the badge appears as stone, iron, gold, emerald, and finally diamond.

Villagers have different outfits depending on their biome. Naturally generated villagers take on the outfit from the biome they were spawned in. When breeding occurs, the outfit of the child is determined by the biome where the breeding occurs, but in Java Edition, there is a 50% chance it's inherited from the biome type of the parents (equal chance for both parents). In case the villager's outfit is determined by biome but the biome has no specific villager type, it always becomes a plains villager. The outfits available are:

## Trading

The trading system is a gameplay mechanic that allows players to buy and sell various items to and from villagers, using emeralds as a currency. Their trades can be valuable or somewhat meaningless, depending on the cost, the items the player might get, and how the player treats the villagers. Only adult villagers with professions can trade; the player cannot trade with nitwits, unemployed villagers, or baby villagers. Attempting to do so causes the villager to display a head-bobbling animation and play the villager's declined trade sound‌[Java Edition  only].

Pressing the use control on an employed villager allows a player to trade, making offers based on the villager's profession and profession level. All offers involve emeralds as a currency, and items related to the villager's profession. Trading can allow the acquisition of items that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain, such as enchanted books with "treasure" enchantments (e.g. Mending), bottles o' enchanting, or chainmail armor. When a villager gets a new trade, they receive 10 seconds of Regeneration I (totaling to 4 of restoration), which emits pink particles. The villager also emits green particles suggesting contentment.

Completing a trade with a villager increases its professional level. Some trades grant higher levels to the villager than others. As it advances through its profession, the villager offers additional trades. When a villager unlocks a new trade at a higher level, it almost always grants more experience than lower-level trades.

Villagers have a maximum supply of items and after the player has traded for an item that many times, the villager's supply of the item is exhausted. This results in the trade being temporarily locked. A player can continue to trade for the villager's other available items if any. Exhausted items are restocked when the villager works at a job site, up to twice per day.

In Bedrock Edition, librarian villagers have a 50% chance to sell enchanted books as part of their trades at novice, apprentice, and journeyman-level, and have 1⁄3 chance to sell enchanted books at expert-level as part of their trades, meaning each librarian villager can sell up to four books. The price ranges between 5-64 emeralds per book. Based on the level of the enchantment and whether it is classified as a "treasure enchantment" (meaning they are not obtainable by enchanting, e.g. Mending), which doubles the cost, or not a price is determined.

In Java Edition, librarian villagers have a 2⁄3 chance to sell an enchanted book as part of their trades at the novice, apprentice, and journeyman level, and have a 50% chance to sell an enchanted book at the expert level, meaning each librarian can sell up to four books. The price ranges from 5-64 emeralds per book, depending on the enchantment's level as well as whether or not it is a treasure enchantment.

| Level   | Lowest price | Highest price     |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| I (1)   | 5            | 19                |
| II (2)  | 8            | 32                |
| III (3) | 11           | 45                |
| IV (4)  | 14           | 58                |
| V (5)   | 17           | 71 (capped at 64) |

They may contain any available enchantment (except Soul Speed and Swift Sneak) at any available level. See trading notes for more information on enchantments and prices.

Clicking use on an unemployed or nitwit villager in Java Edition causes it to grunt and bobble their head; doing so in Bedrock Edition does nothing.

Using a name tag on a villager always names the villager instead of opening the trading interface.

In Java Edition, using space inside of the trading interface after one trade was made refills the trading slots with items from the inventory.[verify]

### Supply and demand
For detailed information on Villager economics, see Trading § Economics.

The price of an item can rise and fall with changes in demand. The price of a traded item can rise when next resupplied, or fall from a risen price if not traded. Demand is stored per item, not per villager.

### Trade offering
Several villagers offering trade items to a player.
When a player holds an item near a villager who wants that item, the villager holds up an item it offers in exchange. For example, a farmer villager who buys 20 wheat for one emerald holds up an emerald, offering it to a player holding wheat. Villagers do not offer trades that are currently out of stock. If the villager has more than one trade for an item, it cycles through the trades, offering a different item every few seconds. This kind of trading interaction makes it easier to find villagers who offer a particular trade, but the player must still open the trading interface to complete the trade. Note that villagers do not hold items to offer trades during their gather or sleep phases, even though it is still possible to trade with them.

### Economic trade
Villagers have levels and require experience to unlock the next tiers of trade; level 1 is a novice, level 2 is apprentice, level 3 is journeyman, level 4 is expert, and level 5 is master. Villagers can resupply trades by themselves by working more at their job site block.

### Popularity or reputation
In Bedrock Edition, villagers increase their prices of trades if a player's popularity is low, (e.g. from damaging villagers), and decrease it if their popularity is high (e.g. from trading with multiple villagers). Curing a zombie villager also increases the player's popularity by 10.

In Java Edition, a villager's prices are affected by the player's reputation with that villager rather than by village popularity.

### Hero of the Village
Main article: Hero of the Village
When a player receives Hero of the Village, players receive discounted prices on all the items traded by villagers in both editions. The Hero of the Village also gets gifts.‌[Java Edition  only] Each villager throws gifts related to its profession, and nitwits and unemployed villagers throw wheat seeds instead. These gifts range in value from common (like seeds) to rare items (like chainmail armor). A player's popularity increases by 10 in Java Edition and doesn't increase in Bedrock Edition. Villagers also shoot off fireworks, with different colored fireworks with no pattern.

## Similar mobs
### Zombie villagers
An example of a zombie villager.
Main article: Zombie Villager
When a zombie kills a villager, it can turn the villager into a zombie villager, depending on the difficulty: 0% chance on Easy, 50% chance on Normal and 100% chance on Hard. Zombie villagers also spawn naturally in the Overworld in the same conditions as a normal zombie, although much less commonly, with a 5% chance. Zombie villagers also spawn in abandoned villages (zombie villages) and igloos. They do not spawn from the zombie monster spawner in Java Edition.

### Wandering trader
A wandering trader.
Main article: Wandering Trader
Wandering traders are passive mobs that spawn randomly close to the player in both editions, or periodically in village gathering sites in Bedrock Edition. Wandering traders also spawn near bells. Two trader llamas spawn leashed to the wandering trader when a wandering trader is naturally spawned, and in Bedrock Edition when summoned or spawned using a spawn egg.

Players may use emeralds to buy items from wandering traders without the need of unlocking the previous trade, but cannot trade items for emeralds. They also lock trades like villagers, but never unlock the trade, nor can they work at any job site blocks. Like villagers, wandering traders are attacked by most zombie variants (though they do not have a zombified form, they die if a zombie kills it, even on hard difficulty), illagers, ravagers‌[Java Edition  only], and vexes. 

Wandering traders also drink a Potion of Invisibility at night (or when they see a hostile mob such as an illager or zombie). They also drink a milk bucket in the morning to remove the Invisibility. They despawn after 40 minutes (even with a name tag or in a minecart or boat) with their llamas.

	- Additional fields for mobs that can breed
	- 
	- Tags common to all entities

	- Tags common to all mobs
	- 
	- Tags common to all villagers
	- Inventory: Each compound tag in this list is an item in the villager's inventory, up to a maximum of 8 slots. Items in two or more slots that can be stacked together are automatically condensed into one slot. If there are more than 8 slots, the last slot is removed until the total is 8. If there are 9 slots but two previous slots can be condensed, the last slot returns after the two other slots are combined.
		- An item in the inventory, excluding the Slot tag.

			- Tags common to all items
	- LastRestock: The last tick the villager went to their job site block to resupply their trades.
	- LastGossipDecay: The last tick all gossip of the villager has decreased strength naturally.
	- RestocksToday: The number of restocks a villager has done in 10 minutes from the last restock, or0if the villager has not restocked in the last 10 minutes. When a villager has restocked twice in less than 10 minutes, it waits at least 10 minutes for another restock.
	- Willing: 1 or 0 (true/false) – true if the villager is willing to mate. Becomes true after certain trades (those that would cause offers to be refreshed), and false after mating.
