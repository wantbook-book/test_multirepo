## Classification
They take extra damage from tridents enchanted with Impaling,‌‌[until JE Edition Combat Tests] and, except axolotl, do not cause pufferfish to inflate nor take damage from them. All aquatic mobs except dolphins are immune to drowning, and all except guardians, elder guardians, and turtles take suffocation damage if out of water for too long. Aquatic mobs have the ability to swim, whereas other mobs simply float on water or sink. All aquatic mobs except dolphins and turtles and axolotls are attacked by axolotls.

All of these mobs are also part of the aquatic entity tag.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5]

Although drowned are an underwater variant of zombies (and can swim in Bedrock Edition), they are classified as undead, not as aquatic.

In Bedrock Edition, there is no in-game classification for these mobs.
