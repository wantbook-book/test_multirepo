# Drowned
Drowned are neutral mobs and common underwater zombie variants that spawn in oceans, rivers and dripstone caves, or when zombies drown. They usually attack through melee attacks, but may also come armed with tridents that they throw. They are the only renewable source of copper.

## Spawning
### Natural generation
Drowned spawn naturally at light level of 0 in all ocean biomes, aquifers in the dripstone caves biome, and river biomes. They spawn at higher rates in rivers and dripstone caves than in ocean biomes.

In Java Edition, drowned spawn individually inside flowing water or source water that is 2 blocks or taller (this can include waterlogged blocks). In ocean biomes, drowned spawn at Y < 58, or at least 6 blocks below sea level; this restriction does not apply to rivers. 

In Bedrock Edition, drowned spawn in groups of 2–4 inside flowing water or source water of any depth, but they spawn at higher rates in water that is 2 blocks or taller.[more information needed] They spawn only on the surface that is on the highest spawnable block at any given X, Z coordinate. They count toward the monster population control cap and also have their own density caps of 5 in oceans and 2 in rivers. 

Drowned have a chance to spawn with either a trident or a fishing rod, and occasionally with a nautilus shell. in Java Edition, they also have a small chance of spawning while riding a chicken, creating a drowned chicken jockey. They are the only zombie variant within the game that cannot spawn naturally with any armor. The only way drowned can spawn with armor is if they used to be a zombie with armor. Their eyes give off a glow effect, but not any light levels.

### Ocean ruins
Drowned spawn during the generation of certain ocean ruin structures. These drowned do not naturally despawn unless the world is set to Peaceful difficulty.

### Conversion
A zombie converting into a drowned.
If a zombie's head (not the legs) is submerged in water continuously for 30 seconds, it begins the process of converting to a drowned. It starts shaking, similar to the effect seen while a zombie villager is being cured. At this point, the process cannot be stopped, and 15 seconds later the zombie becomes drowned. The drowned appears with full health even if the previous zombie did not.

In Bedrock Edition only, an item being held or worn by a zombie when it becomes drowned, whether it was picked up or naturally spawned, has a 100% drop rate, which includes any naturally spawned equipment dropping with full durability.

Only normal zombies can transform, while zombie villagers and zombified piglin can not. For husks, they first transform into a regular zombie, and subsequently convert to a drowned in the usual fashion. The zombie that converted from a husk also always has full health even if converted from a damaged husk.

## Drops

1. ↑Dropped only when kill credit is given to the player

Adult drowned drop 5 and an additional 1–3 per naturally-spawned equipment if killed by a player, axolotl or tamed wolf. Baby drowned drop 12 and an additional 1–3 per naturally-spawned equipment if killed by a player, axolotl or tamed wolf.

- 1Helmet,Chestplate,Leggings, and/orBoots.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping, and drops without changing the damage that has accumulated on it.

If a drowned is able to pick up equipment and is wielding a trident, it can trade its trident for a nautilus shell if it is not currently attacking anything.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

### Equipment
** Java Edition **
For naturally-spawned drowned:

- In the main hand:
	- Each drowned has a 6.25% chance to spawn with atrident. May be enchanted.[more information needed]
	- Each drowned has a 3.75% chance to spawn with afishing rod. May be enchanted.[more information needed]
- In the offhand:
	- Each drowned has a 3% chance to spawn with anautilus shell.

A drowned holding a trident has an 8.5% chance to drop it when killed by a player or tamed wolf. The chance is increased by 1% per level of Looting, up to a max of 11.5% with Looting III. This means the overall chance of obtaining a trident (per drowned spawn) is 0.53125% without Looting (about 1 in 188), or 0.71875% with Looting III (about 1 in 139).

A drowned holding a nautilus shell always drops it.

Zombies converted to drowned are never equipped with any items.[more information needed]

On Halloween, a drowned may spawn wearing a carved pumpkin or jack o'lantern. However, they do not drop this, even when killed with Looting.

** Bedrock Edition **
For naturally-spawned drowned:

- Main hand (mutually exclusive):
	- Each drowned has a 15% chance to spawn with atrident. May be enchanted.[more information needed]
	- Each drowned has a 0.85% chance to spawn with afishing rod. May be enchanted.[more information needed]
- In the offhand:
	- Each drowned has a 8% chance to spawn with anautilus shell.

A drowned holding a trident has a 25% chance to drop it when killed by a player or tamed wolf. This chance is increased by 4% per level of Looting, up to a max of 37% with Looting III. This means the overall chance of obtaining a trident (per drowned) is 3.75% without Looting (1 in 27), or 5.55% with Looting III (1 in 18).

For converted drowned:

- 1% spawn with afishing rodin the main hand.
- 8% spawn with anautilus shellin the offhand (same as naturally spawned drowned).
