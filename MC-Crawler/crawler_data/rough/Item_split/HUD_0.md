## Display
All existing bars in the HUD. Clockwise starting from the bottom left: the experience bar, the health bar, the armor bar, the oxygen bar, and the hunger bar.
The HUD consists of the user's health, hunger and experience bars, the hotbar, as well as a crosshair that designates the currently focused on block or entity if the player is not playing on a mobile device and has not enabled split controls. The armor condition bar appears above the health bar if the player is wearing armor, and the oxygen bar displays above the hunger bar if the player's air supply NBT tag is below 300. Note that the health and armor bars are on the top left and the hunger and oxygen bars are on the top right if the player is in Bedrock Edition and has chosen the Pocket Edition UI.

In Creative mode, the health, hunger, oxygen, experience and armor bars are hidden.

Chat is also part of the HUD, in the bottom left corner‌[Java Edition  only]/top left corner‌[Bedrock Edition  only], showing anything recently spoken or commands recently executed. This can be expanded with T.

The textures are handled by icons.png.

### Hotbar
The hotbar in Java Edition.
The hotbar in Bedrock Edition. The inventory button is visible when using touch input.
The hotbar is a selection bar that appears on the bottom of the screen. It is where the player stores and selects commonly used items. It consists of the bottom nine slots within the player's inventory. The selected item also displays on the right side of the screen, or an empty fist if the slot is empty. When the player switches an item in hand by mouse wheel or 1-9, its name is shown above the experience level for a short period of time. This name appears in italics.

Players can dual wield allowing a second item to be shown on the left (or right if the player's main hand is set to "left"), along with an additional hotbar slot on the same side. Both the slot and the item are shown only if it contains an item, which can either be added using the GUI or by pressing "swap items." In Java Edition, it shows the off-hand slot with the items equipped on the left of the hotbar. In Bedrock Edition, this is not the case although the item is still equipped in the off-hand slot.

In Bedrock Edition, the hotbar has an additional button for the inventory. However, this is present only on mobile devices such as Android, iOS, and Windows 10 (with touch screen). On the New Nintendo 3DS Edition, the hotbar is located on the Touch Screen and is slightly different.

### Paper doll

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition. 


The paper doll is a side-view of the player displayed in the top-left corner of the screen. It shows the player's skin and any armor worn. If the player is walking, the paper doll shows the player's legs moving. If the player is sneaking, sprint-swimming, or flying with elytra, this can also be seen.

The paper doll can be turned on and off by pressing F8 on PC.

### Mobile controller

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition.
