### Spawned values
When spawned in any way except breeding – for instance, using commands, spawning naturally, spawning as part of a skeleton trap, or using spawn eggs – donkeys are assigned their stats within certain ranges, specific according to their horse type.

#### Health
Donkey's health ranges from 15–30, with an average of 22.5 × 11.25. A donkey with an odd number of health points does not show the last half-heart.

#### Movement speed
A spawned donkey's speed value is always 0.175, but it moves at the slightly reduced 7.38 blocks/sec. For reference, the player's normal walking speed is 0.1, equivalent to 4.3 blocks/sec. and the player's sprinting speed is equivalent to 5.6 blocks/sec. The speed listed does not include any status effect that affects the speed of a horse or a player.

A bred donkey's speed value has the same limits as other horses, between 0.1125 and 0.3375. See Horse#Movement speed.

See transportation to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.

#### Jump strength
A spawned donkey's jump strength is always 0.5, enough to clear 1 9⁄16 blocks. A bred donkey's jump strength has the same limits as other horses, between 0.4 and 1.0. See Tutorials/Horses#Speed.

### Bred values
When breeding two donkeys, the foal's stats are determined by a variation of the average of both parents' stats, randomly determined the same way horses' stats are.
