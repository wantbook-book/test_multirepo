### 2024
#### Minecraft website
The minecraft.net website was updated to feature several intractable poisonous potatoes across the home page. When clicked, they deplete the health bar below the Minecraft logo, losing 1.5 - 2 hearts per click. When health bar gets fully depleted, user is greeted with a "You Died!" screen saying "You awoke the Toxifin", showing the score (consuming a potato gives you 1500 score [?] ) and a big "Respawn" button. Clicking the "Respawn" button takes the user back to the minecraft.net and resets all the poisonous potatoes.

This joke feature can be toggled on or off by clicking "Turn off potatoes" on the top left corner.

#### Minecraft Launcher
The loading animation has been changed to a spinning poisonous potato with poison effect particles. Rarely[more information needed], however, the loading screen can appear as a regular potato instead. Additionally, when clicking in the launcher, either 1 or 9[more information needed] potatoes fly from where the mouse is clicked and fading out. The Play & Install buttons, the menu tab, and the headline's text had been changed from "Noto-sans" to the handwritten-like potato font named "Potatis". Additionally, all the E's, R's, and N's have been drawn backwards. This may or may not[more information needed] be intentional, but there has been no confirmation yet.

These joke features can be toggled on or off by toggling the "Enable April Fools 2024" checkbox in the launcher settings.
