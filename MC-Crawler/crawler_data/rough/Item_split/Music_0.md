## Playing
Music tracks can play at various points during gameplay. Some types of music are triggered by events, while others play randomly while certain criteria are met. The song "Alpha" always plays instantly during the credits, and the song "Boss" always plays instantly while the player is in the End if the ender dragon is undefeated or resummoned. Both of these tracks start playing in place of any already playing music. If the player is in the End and the ender dragon has been defeated, the normal End track plays 5 to 20 minutes after any currently playing tracks are finished.

If the player is underwater in an ocean or river biome, random underwater tracks play randomly 10 to 20 minutes after any currently playing tracks are finished.[1]

If none of the previous criteria are met, but the player is in the Nether, a random general Nether track or a Nether biome-specific track plays, except warped forests, which don't have any music. If the player is not in the Nether and is currently in Creative mode, a random track plays (Creative only on Bedrock). If the player is not in Creative but is currently playing (i.e., not on the menu screen), a random general track plays. These tracks all play 10 to 20 minutes after any currently playing tracks are finished.

If the player is on the menu screen, a random menu track starts playing after 1 to 30 seconds.

Menu music stops playing in Java Edition when the player leaves the main menu and stops playing in Bedrock Edition when a loading screen finishes. Game music stops playing when the player quits the world. When the game is paused in Java Edition, game music also pauses and resumes when the player exits the pause menu. in Bedrock Edition, this is not the case because the game does not pause.

All music as well as sounds in Minecraft are stored in the sound directory. However, the sound files are obfuscated and cannot be directly accessed. To get around with this, the sound directory can be extracted by the methods showed in Tutorials/Sound directory.‌[Java Edition  only]

## List
Tracks by C418 have been shortened to 30 seconds on this wiki, due to an agreement with the composer. "11" is exempt from this.
### Overworld music
These music tracks are played when the player is in the Overworld.
