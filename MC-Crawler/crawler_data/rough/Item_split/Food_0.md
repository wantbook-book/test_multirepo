# Food
Food refers to any consumable items that, when eaten, restore hunger points and hunger saturation points, and sometimes cause status effects. They are essential for survival, as going without them eventually causes the player to starve, causing damage until reaching 10 in Easy difficulty, and 1 on Normal. Starvation damage kills the player in Hard and Hardcore Mode.

Food is eaten by holding use while having the food item selected in the hot bar or in the off-hand. Only cake cannot be eaten this way, and must instead be placed on a surface before being eaten.

With the exception of chorus fruit, golden apples, enchanted golden apples, honey bottles, and suspicious stew, food cannot be eaten when the hunger bar is completely full. In Creative mode, any food can be consumed at any time.

All food items and ingredients can be stacked in the inventory slots, except for rabbit stew, mushroom stew, beetroot soup, suspicious stew, and cake.‌[Java Edition  only]

This page covers food items for players. Blocks and items that can be eaten by other mobs, such as wolves are covered on their respective pages.

## Hunger and saturation
Main article: Hunger § Mechanics
See also: Tutorials/Hunger_management

Raw (left) and cooked (right) chicken. Eating raw chicken can give the player food poisoning.
Players have two different food statistics, one of which is visible: The hunger level is visible, and the saturation level is not.

Saturation is the first statistic to decrease when a player performs energy-intensive actions, and it must be completely depleted before the visible hunger meter begins decreasing. Although the current saturation level is generally hidden, the player can tell that their saturation level is completely depleted if the visible hunger meter begins displaying a jittering effect.

Eating a food item replenishes a fixed number of hunger points and saturation points, based on the item. Some foods have a better ratio of saturation to hunger points replenished than others. Overeating the hunger bar does not overflow to saturation.

A player's current saturation level can never exceed their current hunger level. A player at a hunger level of 5, for example, can be at a maximum of 5 saturation. Food always restores hunger (raising the saturation limit) before supplying saturation. The most efficient use of food is to eat low-saturation food to fill the hunger bar, followed by high-saturation food to fill saturation. While a few hunger points may be wasted when eating nourishing food when nearly full, eating nourishing foods on a low hunger bar wastes even more points of saturation. Maximizing saturation increases the length of time (and/or the amount of damage healed) before the player needs to eat again.

### Usage
Any food, except cake, can be eaten by hand, by using the food item in the main hand. It takes 1.61 seconds to eat most foods by hand. Although, dried kelp only takes 0.865 seconds to eat by hand. A player can hold food in their offhand in Java Edition, and use.

Eating food by hand causes food particles to spew from the player's mouth, and produces a munching noise. The particles correlate with the respective food item. Eating also slows the user significantly.

Cake has to be eaten by placing it, then right-clicking on its block form. Eating a slice of cake is instant, and each cake has 7 edible slices. The cake becomes thinner as each slice is removed.

### Nourishment value
Nourishment is defined as the ratio of saturation to hunger points restored. Foods with higher nourishment values should be eaten when the hunger bar is more full.

The nourishment table below can help by categorizing foods by their saturation-to-hunger restoration ratios. See the more detailed Foods table for the exact hunger and saturation statistics of each food.

1. ↑ a b‌[Java Edition  only]
2. ↑ a b‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
3. ↑Food Points + Saturation, which gives roughly how long the food can last. See hunger for details.  This value is reduced if the player is near the food or saturation cap, as excess points of either type are wasted.
4. ↑ a b cAverage expected food quality if food poisoning isn't cured. Food poisoning lasts 30 seconds from the last food that inflicted it, and drains nearly 2 shanks of hunger over that duration.  The loss comes from saturation before visible hunger.
5. ↑Food quality if poison isn't cured; healing the damage from poison quickly drains the hunger bar.
