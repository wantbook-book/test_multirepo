** Hanging Signs **
- A more expensive version of normal signs, which can be crafted with 2chainsand 6stripped logs, resulting 6 of them.
- Has a total of 10 wood variants:oak,spruce,birch,jungle,acacia,dark oak,mangrove,bamboo,crimson, andwarped.
- Can be hung up in the following ways:
	- Underneath a block that provides support in the center, like a fence or an iron bar.
		- When the hanging sign is placed underneath a non-full block, or when placed while sneaking, the chains will take on an upside-down v-shape. Signs in this configuration can be placed in 16 different angles, similar to an armor stand.
	- Underneath a full block.
		- When the hanging sign is placed underneath a full block, the chains will be on parallel sides of the sign. Signs in this configuration can be placed in the 4 cardinal directions, North, South, East, and West.
	- Attached to the solid side of a block.
		- When attached to the side of a block, its chains will be parallel, hanging onto a horizontal bar sticking out from the side of said block. Hanging signs in this configuration will display text perpendicular to the side of the block they were attached to.
	- Attached to the side or underneath another hanging sign.
		- This will display the same way is being placed underneath a non-full block.
- Cannot be placed directly on the ground without support from the side or above.
	- However, hanging signs that have a horizontal bar will not break when the supporting block is removed.
- If it is hanging underneath of a block and that block is broken, the hanging sign will also break immediately.
- Unlike regular signs, the space available for text is much smaller.
- Text can be dyed with any color of dye and tinted withglow ink sacsto make text glow.
