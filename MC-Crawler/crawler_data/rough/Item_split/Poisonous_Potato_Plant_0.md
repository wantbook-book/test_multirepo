## Obtaining
### Breaking
A poisonous potato plant drops 1% of the time from fully grown potato crops growing on farmland, poison farmland, or gravtater blocks.

Poisonous potato ore has a 5% chance to drop a poisonous potato plant when mined using a stone pickaxe or better. If the ore is mined using a pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch, it drops itself in ore form instead.

Blocks mined using a tool with the Potatofication enchantment have a 5% chance to drop a poisonous potato plant.

### Chest Loot
One poisonous potato plant can be found in the bonus chest that generates near spawn in any world created in this snapshot.

It also can rarely be found in shipwreck supply chests.

## Usage
Texture with glasses and pink nose appears only when player is hovering their cursor over the item, otherwise it looks like a normal poisonous potato. Despite its name, it can't actually be planted.

The item can be placed in the player's helmet slot. This gives an advancement "On Closer Inspection..." and starts the P.P.P. monologue, which appears line after line in the top left corner of the screen.

After clicking on the item four times, lore is shown when hovering over the item, saying "On closer inspection this Poisonous Potato is a plant".

The appearing of the next line of the monologue is triggered by the player either jumping or completing a certain task. If the player removes the item from the helmet slot and puts it back, the last line of monologue is replayed. Certain parts of the monologue can be skipped if player completes a task relevant to the quest.

If the player dies or falls into the void of the Potato dimension, the monologue progress restarts.

### The monologue
- Well, well, well. It looks like you found us. (Press [Space] to acknowledge)
- Woah, steady on your feet there <PLAYERNAME>.
- You're probably thinking: "What's the deal with this guy?"
- I invite you to take a moment to consider my situation.
- We've been planning on infiltrating Minecraft for weeks.
- But all we could manage is sneaking into this April Fools' Snapshot.
- And now you've discovered us.
- Do you have any idea how difficult it is to write Java code?
- It's not as simple as copying samples from the internet.
- There's also a lot of pasting involved.
- We had to write tens of lines of code by rolling on the keys and hoping for the best.
- And now that I have finally infiltrated Minecraft: You pranced on over, picked me up, and plopped me on your head.
- I must say, you have incredible balance keeping me up here.
- Especially considering you're jumping so much.
- Why are you jumping? Are you being startled?
- I don't see much to be startled by around here.
- Then again, I have no eyes as I am a Poisonous Potato.
- So really I'm not going to see much at all.
- Although the little sprouts growing out of me are also called eyes.
- Perhaps if I squint hard enough I can see where we're at.
- Watch out! There's a block over there! Try not to be startled by it!
- Maybe you need a moment to breathe and relax. This world is very startling, afterall.
- If we can find a Village we could take one of those Beds and rest.
- Let's find a Minecraft Village.

The next part of the monologue activates once the player enters a village.

- There should be a Bed around here that we can take.

Here, the player has three choices. If they leave the village, P.P.P. reminds them about the quest:

- Woah, woah, woah. You need to rest your tired feet, remember?
- Let's go back to that Village and take a Bed.

If player sleeps in a bed, the monologue continues as follows:

- I'm pretty sure I said TAKE a bed.
- Sleeping in a Bed is not the same as taking a Bed.
- If I had meant that, I would have said: "Hey <PLAYERNAME>. You should TAKE a nap".

If they instead put a bed in the inventory, the monologue continues as follows:

- Did I say take a Bed? I think I meant to say "Take a nap".

After this split, both monologue paths merge again.

- By the way-
- What do you think of this year's April Fools' joke?
- I preferredthe one where you could only pick up a single Block.
- But this year I think they nailed it.
- Potatoes!
- Hilarious.
- Anyways. I am genuinely interested in your thoughts.
- ...
- I'm trying to read your thoughts, but I don't think we are communicating with telepathy.
- At least, two way telepathy. This feels rather unidirectional.
- And then you jump every now and then.
- I am only assuming that jumping is a sign of acknowledgement.
- Perhaps I can modify your inventory...

Next, P.P.P. tries to put a piece of paper into player's inventory: they pick up the first empty slot to do that. Paper has the Lore text:

"Write your thoughts on the April Fools' Snapshot!"

If there are no empty slots, this fails, but the monologue continues anyway.

- You should hopefully have some Paper on you.
- Oh wait, you need an Anvil too.

Then, an anvil spawns 4 blocks in front of the player, 2 blocks upward.

- There, that should do it.
- Use that anvil to write your thoughts on the Paper.

The next part of the monologue activates once the player renames a piece of paper on an anvil; this does not need to be the paper with lore.

- I don't think I can read that Paper.
- My Potato eyes aren't suitable for reading.
- Remember what I said about not being able to see?
- Nothing has changed in that department.
- I will assume that you are VERY enthusiastic about the Snapshot.
- It will be on page 1 of my report.
- "<PLAYERNAME> really likes the Poisonous Potato themed jokes."
- There. It's in my report.
- Actually I might need that Paper back.[note 1]
- I tore it from the back of my report.
- And I think that page was the appendix...
- The first item in the appendix will be your take on this Snapshot.
- You must be wondering what this report is about.
- It pertains as to why I am here in Minecraft.
- And that information is CLASSIFIED.
- But I will hint that it involves the Poisonous Potato.
- We believe there is some significance to the Poisonous Potato.
- And from analysis of the Minecraft code...
- We believe you should try cutting out the eyes.
- Or more accurately: Craft out the Potato Eyes.
- Go on <PLAYERNAME>. Craft Potato Eyes from a Poisonous Potato.

The next part of the monologue activates after the player takes potato eyes out of the crafting table or a crafting grid in their inventory. Crafting the eyes must not be a shift-click.

- Wow nice crafting. Have you played Minecraft before?
- Now we're going to go on a little adventure.
- Throw the Potato Eye into the air.
- When I say "throw" I don't mean "drop".
- It's something to do with "Using" the Potato Eye with Right Button.[note 2]
- Look into the sky and use the Potato Eye with Right Button.

Once player does that, the potato eye flies up in the sky, showing the direction to a nearest ruined portatol, and monologue continues:

- Excellent.
- It looks like a developer copy-pasted the Ender Eye code for this.
- That means there's a chance these Potato Eyes could break.
- Remember to craft more if you lose a Potato Eye.
- Wow a Minecraft adventure. This is exciting.
- I wonder what the deal is with the Potatoes?
- Perhaps the Developers REALLY like Potatoes.
- At least, the Poisonous ones.
- Poisonous Potatoes, that is.
- Not Poisonous Developers.
- Do you think the Developers are hiding somewhere in this Snapshot?
- Maybe we will meet one!
- You should take my Minecraft ideas to show them.

A written book, titled "My Minecraft Ideas" and written by "P.P.P." appears in player's inventory. The book has 3 pages filled with silly ideas for Minecraft.

After the player receives the book, the monologue continues.

- I've written my best Minecraft ideas in this book.
- They are very original ideas.
- If the Developers don't use them then I could make a mod.
- Or maybe they could give me a job?
- I could start by making everyone coffee.
- I'd tell jokes about drinking coffee and writing Java code.
- They probably only hire Minecraft experts.
- <PLAYERNAME>! We should become Minecraft experts!
- And I know the perfect way to do that.
- Our intelligence tells us of a legendary Greatstaff:Potatiesh.
- Spoiler alert: It is the ultimate item in this April Fools' Snapshot.
- You need to acquire Potatiesh, Greatstaff of the Peasant.

The next part of the monologue activates when player finds a ruined portatol.

- Is that the portal?
- It seems a little...Worse for wear.
- I see a Pedestal in the middle.
- Have you got a spare Poisonous Potato with you?
- Try using a Poisonous Potato with the Pedestal.

Once the player does that, a potato portal appears, and monologue continues.

- Just as I thought. A portal.
- I think you know what happens next.
- You're going to waltz on in there, find a Dragon, and destroy some Potato themed crystals.
- This Snapshot is dripping with creativity.
- Lucky that I am here to provide commentary and context.

The next part of the monologue activates when player enters the Potato dimension.

- At last. The Potato Dimension.
- Does something smell...Starchy to you?
- I think you need to change your shampoo.
- I am feeling quite greasy up here.
- Let's focus on the task at hand.
- ...
- This place is looking rather tragic.
- Have you seen the animals?
- The Minecraft Pig is looking pretty cheeky.
- And so is the Cow. Very cheeky.
- Anyhow, we should find a Potato Village.
- There should be a Potato Village around here somewhere...

The next part of the monologue activates once the player enters a potato village.

- Awesome, you're in a Potato Village.
- This will be our base of operations from here on out.
- Familiarize yourself with the Villagers.
- Steal their loot, etc. The usual Minecraft stuff.
- There's some neat stuff around here.
- Most of it is Potato themed.
- But as long as you think Potatoes are neat. You'll be right at home.
- Once you're ready: Throw another one of those Potato Eyes.

Once player does that, the potato eye flies up in the sky, showing the direction to a nearest colosseum, and monologue continues:

- On the road, once again.
- This time we're looking for a dangerous place.
- It'll be a battle against the ultimate Potato.
- That's all the information I have.
- If I were to guess: It's probably a Maris Piper.
- Known to be the most versatile of the Potatoes.
- It's worth going in with the right tools.
- Sharpen up some swords, boil up some potions.
- Don't forget to also cook up some potatoes.
- We're certainly not lacking for potatoes here.

The next part of the monologue activates once the player gets close to a colosseum.

- The Potato Eye is pointing around here.
- That means we're near the right place!
- Let's start digging until we find the structure.
- Come on, <PLAYERNAME>. Time to put the MINE into Minecraft.
- ...
- What I'm trying to say is: Start digging.
- Mine your way into the structure.

When the player enters the colosseum, monologue continues:

- Woah. I think we're here.
- This looks like some kind of Colosseum.
- I think you'll need this Wooden Sword.

A standard wooden sword is added to player's inventory.

- Defend yourself. I'll watch your back!
- Look out!
- Try a critical hit!
- Swing faster!
- No, don't do that!
- Is that TNT?
- If only you were wearing a helmet.
- Go that way!
- Go the other way!
- Try unplugging your mouse and swinging it!
- Place some blocks!
- Throw a blanket over it!
- Try spinning really fast!

The monologue then cycles through last 12 lines. It continues after player acquires Potatiesh, Greatstaff of the Peasant, which drops after killing the mega spud.

- This is Potatiesh, Greatstaff of the Peasant!
- Now I need you to follow my instructions very carefully.
- Place Potatiesh into a Composter.
- Trust me. I will definitely NOT betray you.
- Find a Composter, and pop Potatiesh in there.
- It would be super cool if you closed your eyes afterwards.
- Just pop Potatiesh into a Composter, and then close your eyes.
- It's a really real thing that you can definitely do.
- Find a Composter, and use Potatiesh with it.

When player places Potatiesh, Greatstaff of the Peasant into the composter, the advancement "Good Plant" is granted and monologue continues.

- Wow I can't believe you fell for that.
- Potatiesh really is the ultimate Staff.
- And now it's half-way composted into Bonemeal.
- Congratulations.
- I made a fool out of you <PLAYERNAME>.
- April Fools'!

The completion time for the monologue is then shown on screen.
