# Smithing Template
Smithing templates are items used in smithing tables to alter tools and armor. They are consumed when used, but can be duplicated using an existing template, its material, and diamonds.

The 16 (or 18‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0]) armor trim smithing templates are found in a variety of generated structures and are used to apply various decorative trims to armor with its color determined by the used material. Netherite upgrade smithing templates are used to upgrade diamond equipment to netherite, and are only found in bastion remnants and guaranteed in treasure rooms.

## Obtaining
Smithing templates can be found in various structures and can be duplicated by crafting the smithing template with seven diamonds and its corresponding material.

### Mob loot
Elder guardians have a 20% chance to drop 1 tide armor trim upon death. Looting doesn't affect this percentage, and the elder guardian doesn't need to be killed by a player in order for the trim to drop.

Note: In woodland mansions, only chests with random loot have the chance to contain the Vex Smithing Template; chests in the "Allium room", "Sapling farm", "Tree-chopping room" and "Fake End portal room" always generate with the same loot, specific to their respective rooms.
