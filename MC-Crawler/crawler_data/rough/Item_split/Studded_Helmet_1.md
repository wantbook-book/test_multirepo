#### Grass block top texture duplicate
In Beta 1.6 Test Build 3, a duplicate of the grass block top texture was added to terrain.png. This version also added grass and ferns, which appear adjacent to this texture.

Interestingly, in Beta 1.9 Prerelease 5, despite being completely unused in-game, this texture was actually changed alongside other block textures that changed in this version. The actually used grass block texture also changed in this version, however despite both textures being identical beforehand, the Beta 1.9 Prerelease 5 textures made the two textures visually distinct from each other.

The terrain.png used in Pocket Edition v0.2.0 alpha, being based off of the terrain.png from Java Edition 1.0.0, also includes this texture. It was also present in Xbox 360 Edition since its inception, due to initially being based on Java Edition Beta 1.6.6.

The texture was eventually removed from Java Edition in 13w02a and Pocket Edition in v0.8.0 alpha build 2 due to the deprecation of terrain.png in those versions. It was removed from Xbox 360 Edition in TU12 due to being replaced by the vertical dispenser texture, although it still technically persists in the base game as the original terrain.png was never removed, despite never being used in TU3 onwards.

- The retextured duplicate
- The retextured actual grass block top, which differs from the duplicate


#### 
In Beta 1.8 Pre-release, a texture possibly composed of three footprints was added to terrain.png. Its intended use is unknown. The texture was eventually removed in 13w03a due to terrain.png's deprecation in 13w02a and the subsequent removal of it and results.png.

This texture also carried on to Pocket Edition in v0.2.0 alpha due to the terrain.png used then being based off of the one from Java Edition 1.0.0, before its removal in v0.8.0 alpha build 2.

The texture was also present in Xbox 360 Edition since TU0 due to said version including a copy of Java Edition 1.2's terrain.png. It was re-replaced by a lilac placeholder texture in TU12.

These textures, also added to terrain.png in Beta 1.8 Pre-release, remained unused and were removed in 13w03a per terrain.png's deprecation in 13w02a and the subsequent removal of it and results.png. These textures were said to have been used to mark the edges of villages as seen in the Beta 1.8 PAX demo,[8] however footage of these textures in action does not seem to exist.

The "edge" texture was carried to Pocket Edition in v0.2.0 alpha, however the "corner" texture was not, as its place was taken up by the info_update texture. The "edge" was removed in v0.8.0 alpha build 2 alongside many other such textures.

Both textures were present in Xbox 360 Edition since TU0 due to said version including a copy of Java Edition 1.2's terrain.png. In TU12, the "edge" was replaced by the bottom texture of the block of quartz (later known as the smooth quartz texture), and the "corner" by the top texture of the hopper.

#### 
The last of four unused textures added in Beta 1.8 Pre-release, this white texture was located alongside the three others. Its use is also unknown (potentially, it could be meant to be a "snowy" overlay for saplings), and was removed in 13w02a per terrain.png's deprecation in 13w02a and the subsequent removal of it and results.png.

This texture never appeared in Pocket Edition Alpha, as its position was taken by the texture for info_update2.

The texture was present in Xbox 360 Edition since TU0 due to said version including a copy of Java Edition 1.2's terrain.png. It was re-replaced by a lilac placeholder texture in TU12.







#### Paeonia
The paeonia was a flower type originally planned for implementation in 1.7.2. Originally revealed by Jeb in a screenshot,[9] the flower was never implemented, being superseded by the peony.

However, the texture for the paeonia was still added to the game's texture files in 13w36a as flower_paeonia.png, alongside all the actually implemented flowers. This texture persisted in the files for over four years, eventually being removed in 17w47a without a doubt due to resource changes and the Flattening.

Interestingly, despite the texture being completely unused throughout its presence in the game files, paeonias were redone in the Texture Update beta packs for an unknown reason.

#### Vine variants
Three unused vine variant textures were present in early revisions of the texture update.

In beta 1.9.0.2, these two barrel top textures were added to Bedrock Edition's block textures, but were unused. The "empty" texture visually resembles the later-introduced open texture. What these textures were specifically intended for remains unknown, and it is not known if they have been removed yet.

The textures would likely be used as follows:

- How the empty barrel with the aforementioned texture as the top would look in-game. Again, the empty top texture is different than its later in-game counterpart.
- How the fish-filled barrel with the aforementioned texture as the top would look in-game.


#### Wax block
A texture for a wax block was added to the game files in 19w34a. This texture was removed in 19w42a, as it was never actually intended to be used.[10]





As this was a lone texture, it is implied that it would simply be rendered as a full cube:

#### Calibrated sculk sensor
In 20w49a, these two textures were added to the assets/minecraft/textures/blocks directory. The top texture is a translucent version of the block of amethyst texture, where the side texture is composed of the sculk sensor's side texture overlayed on the amethyst texture. Interestingly, the amethyst textures are based on those from 20w45a, despite these textures being added in 20w49a after the amethyst block textures were redone twice, implying these textures come from a probably long-since-scrapped functionality of the sculk sensor coupled with amethyst. 

The textures were removed in Java Edition 21w13a.[11] The calibrated sculk sensor was later reimplemented on snapshot 23w12a with a new texture.

Possible interpretations of how these textures could have actually looked in-game are as follows:

- One interpretation of how a "calibrated sculk sensor" could look.
- Another interpretation.
