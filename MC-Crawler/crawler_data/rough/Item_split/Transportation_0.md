## Methods

  

This section needs to be updated. 
Please update this section to reflect recent updates or newly available information.Reason: Add speed for throwing a Trident with Riptide enchantment, speed stats for striders when using boost. Add calculations for how many blocks you need to fall to reach terminal velocity vertically as of 1.18 with the increased height limit. Also, walking diagonally is faster, add info of sneaking using the Swift Sneak enchantment, and add info about walking and dashing using camels.


These speeds assume that the form of transportation is not under the effect of the Speed or Slowness, unless mentioned.

** Notes **
1. ↑ a bMultiply the value by 8 to get the Overworld equivalent when doing this in the Nether.
2. ↑Divide by 3 to get kilometres per game day, or by 6 to get kilometres per half-day (from dawn to sunset)
3. ↑ a bAssuming the jump key is released then held mid-air every jump
4. ↑Boat acceleration takes 9.4 seconds—the difference in time between a running start and not, is halved, or 4.7 seconds.
5. ↑ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o pIn the Nether, water cannot be placed without the use of commands or glitches in past versions.
6. ↑Horses vary in speed. They are the fastest method of land transportation on open but unprepared terrain.
7. ↑The swimming speeds are not affected by Swiftness potions. The surface speed refers to "skimming" across the top of the water by holding the spacebar.
8. ↑Underwater refers to any part of the body submerged in water and walking on flat terrain. The Player travels the same speed regardless of if the water is 1 block deep or 2 (in observed cases).
9. ↑Data based on https://youtu.be/PuXX2zkEs48?t=178.
10. ↑Data based on https://youtu.be/nNm5mOeH4pE.
11. ↑Data based on https://youtu.be/ySREkWjks6A.
12. ↑Flying speed can be varied.
13. ↑Data based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Cqxz1-2f8.
14. ↑Values are faster than those listed if the player has the Slow Falling status effect.
15. ↑it is technically possible below; however, the size between the roof of the Nether and the floor is 124 blocks, meaning that it would take less than 2 seconds to go down. Also, achieving speed requires either using rocket boost, or starting above the roof.
