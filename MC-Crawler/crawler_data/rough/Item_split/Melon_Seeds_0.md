Melon seeds can be planted only on farmland, as stems. Over time, a stem grows through several stages[needs testing] and, at its final growth stage, produces melons on any adjacent dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, grass block, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss block, mud or muddy mangrove roots. If a melon is already occupying a spot adjacent to a stem it does not grow more melons until the melons is removed. A single stem can grow an unlimited number of melons. Melon stems need a minimum light level of 10 in the block above the stem to grow and give melons. Melon seeds are affected by bone meal only with respect to stem growth; bone meal does not help produce the actual melons.
