Pumpkin stems are plants grown on farmland that, over time, grow pumpkins on dirt, mud and moss blocks adjacent to them.

## Usage
### Farming
See also: Tutorials/Pumpkin and melon farming

Pumpkin seeds can be planted only on farmland, as stems. Over time, a stem grows through several stages and, at its final growth stage, produces pumpkins on any adjacent dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, grass block, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss block, mud or muddy mangrove roots. If a pumpkin is already occupying a spot adjacent to a stem it does not grow more pumpkins until the pumpkin is removed. A single stem can grow an unlimited number of pumpkins. Pumpkin stems need a minimum light level of 10 in the block above the stem to grow and give pumpkins. Pumpkin seeds are affected by bone meal only with respect to stem growth; bone meal does not help produce the actual pumpkins.
