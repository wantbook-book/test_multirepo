## Obtaining
### Harvesting
Milk buckets can be obtained from cows, mooshrooms, and goats by pressing use while looking at them with an empty bucket.

### Mob loot
A milk bucket has a chance of dropping from a wandering trader, if the trader is killed while holding it.‌[Java Edition  only]

## Usage
To drink milk, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Drinking it immediately removes all status effects from the player and returns an empty bucket. Note that fire is not a status effect; therefore, drinking milk doesn't extinguish a burning player.

In Java Edition, the drinking animation for milk is shown only in first-person camera mode.

The benefits of area status effects granted by beacons and conduits are restored almost immediately in Bedrock Edition and after a few seconds in Java Edition.
