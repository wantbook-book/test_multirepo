A leather cap can be repaired in an anvil by adding leather, with each leather restoring 25% the cap's maximum durability, rounded down. Two helmets of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the cap's enchantments.

1. ↑ a bAll enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.

### Mob loot
Zombies, husks, skeletons, strays, bogged, piglins, and zombified piglins have a small chance to spawn wearing armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the helmet they're wearing upon death. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.

### Trading
In Java Edition, apprentice-level leatherworker villagers have a 2⁄3 chance to sell a leather cap[note 1] for 5 emeralds. Master-level leatherworker villagers offer the same trade.

In Bedrock Edition, apprentice-level leatherworker villagers have a 50% chance to sell leather cap for 5 emeralds as part of their trades, and 50% chance to sell an enchanted leather cap for 5 emeralds at the master level.

1. ↑The leather armor has a random color created by two dyes (possibly the same dye twice.)

## Usage
Leather caps can be placed in the top armor slot of a player's inventory for activation.

### Defense points
Defense points are each signified by half of a shirt of mail in the armor bar above the health bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.

Leather caps add 1 () defense point.
