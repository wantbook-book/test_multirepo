### Experience orbs
Main article: Experience
Experience orbs drop only if a mob dies less than three seconds after being attacked (melee, bow, snowballs, eggs, and potions causing instant damage) by a player or by a player's pet wolf, though not by a player-activated dispenser. Their total value is the specific amount of experience granted by killing that mob. They are also dropped from a thrown bottle o' enchanting. Collected experience accumulates into levels which can be used for enchanting or repairing, or is split equally between accumulating levels and repairing the held tool if said tool is enchanted with mending.

Unlike other drops, such as items, experience orbs appear at the location of the mob's corpse at the moment it disappears in a puff of smoke.‌[BE  only] Experience orbs move toward any nearby players.
