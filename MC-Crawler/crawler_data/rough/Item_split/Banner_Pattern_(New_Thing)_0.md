# Java Edition 23w13a_or_b
23w13a_or_b is an April Fools' joke snapshot, supposedly the first and only snapshot for the "Vote Update", released on April 1, 2023,[1] which, as the primary focus, adds a system where players vote for gameplay features or mechanics to be implemented. This snapshot is a fork of 23w13a.

The snapshot was reuploaded about three hours after the release,[2] to fix some crashes related to transformations and to remove inappropriate color names.
