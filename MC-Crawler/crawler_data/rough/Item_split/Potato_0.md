## Obtaining
### Natural generation
Village farm plots have a chance of being planted with potatoes. The exact chance depends on the style of the village:

| Village style | Chance |
|---------------|--------|
| Snowy         | 70%    |
| Plains        | 15%    |
| Taiga         | 10%    |

Fully grown potato crops drop 2 to 5 potatoes (3 5⁄7 per crop harvested on average) and have a 2% chance of dropping an additional poisonous potato. Potato yield can be increased using a tool enchanted with Fortune, with Fortune III harvesting an average of 5 3⁄7 potatoes. Bone meal can be used to mature the potato to its last stage of growth.

The first two potatoes always drop, and then three more attempts are made to drop a potato with a success rate of 57.14286% to yield the extra 0–3 drops. Each level of Fortune enchantment increases the number of attempts by one.

### Mob loot
Zombies, husks, and zombie villagers have a 2.5% (1⁄40) chance of dropping either an iron ingot, carrot, or potato when killed by a player or tamed wolf. This is increased by 1% (1⁄100) per level of looting. This gives potatoes the following chances of dropping:

- 1⁄120(about 0.83%)
- 7⁄600(about 1.17%) with Looting I
- 9⁄600(1.50%) with Looting II
- 11⁄600(about 1.83%) with Looting III

When killed with fire, a zombie drops a baked potato instead.
