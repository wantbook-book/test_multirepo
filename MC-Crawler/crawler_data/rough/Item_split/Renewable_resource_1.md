### Rare drops
These items are considered rare drops or are obtained by a mob dying in a unique way. For some of these items, this is the only way to obtain them; otherwise, this is the only renewable way to obtain them. Rare drops do not include any item the mob picked up after spawning. Mob farms are an option for obtaining rare drops more easily.
