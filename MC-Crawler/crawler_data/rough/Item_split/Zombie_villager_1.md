### Villager variants
A zombie villager retains its biome and profession after conversion from a villager. They also retain their trades. Below is a table of the variant and what workstation it required before zombification. The zombie villager cannot work at a job site block. 

Below is a table listing the various professions, along with the specific job site block that each profession requires:

1. ↑ a b cDropped only when kill credit is given to the player
2. ↑Dropped as baked potato if on fire when killed.

Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping on death or when cured and drops with the same damage level it had when picked up.

### Naturally-spawned equipment
Zombie villagers do not spawn with equipment in Bedrock Edition. In Java Edition, a zombie villager can spawn with any of the following:

- Carved Pumpkin[note 1]
- Jack o'Lantern‌[Java Edition  only][note 1]
- Iron Shovel
- Iron Sword
- Random Armor
- Zombie villagers have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment (other than Halloween pumpkins), and drop it with a random durability. Each level ofLootingincreases the chance by 1 percentage point (11.5% with Looting III).

1. ↑ a bZombie villagers spawn with pumpkins and jack o'lanterns‌[Java Edition  only] only during Halloween.

### Experience
Adult zombie villagers drop 5 and an additional 1–3 per naturally-spawned equipment. Baby zombie villagers drop 12 experience.

## Behavior
Main article: Zombie § Behavior
Zombie villagers behave as ordinary zombies, except that they do not convert to drowned when submerged.

Zombie villagers that were converted from villagers retain their professions and clothes, which gain a tattered appearance. Naturally spawned zombie villagers (or ones spawned with spawn eggs) have a random profession, and can also spawn with unemployed or nitwit outfits. In Bedrock Edition, baby zombie villagers are always unemployed.

Being an undead mob, they are: 

- damaged by the status effectInstant Healthand healed by the status effectInstant Damage.
- unaffected by the status effectsRegenerationandPoison.
- ignored by thewither.
- affected by theSmiteenchantment.
- a threat toarmadillos, causing them to hide in their shell.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80]

### Curing
See also: Tutorials/Curing a zombie villager

Zombie villagers can be cured (converted to normal villagers) by first giving them the Weakness effect, which can be applied by:

- Asplash potionof Weakness thrown by theplayer, adispenser, or awitch.
- Alingering potionof Weakness thrown by the player or a dispenser.
- Anarrow of Weakness.
- Anarea effect cloudcaused by an explosion of acreeperinflicted with a Weakness effect.‌[Java Edition  only].
- The/effectcommand, if cheats are enabled.

The weakened zombie villager must then be healed by using a (non-enchanted) golden apple on them. The zombie villager begins to shudder to signal that curing is in progress. Also, the Weakness effect is removed, replaced by Strength for the duration of the curing process. An internal countdown timer is then started, counting down the total time to cure.

Time to cure is initially a random integer between 3600 and 6000 ticks (180 to 300 seconds, 3—5 minutes). On each tick, there is a 1% chance for the game to look for cure accelerants. It checks each block within a 9×9×9 cube centered on the villager for either an iron bar or a bed (either half: they're detected separately). For each one found up to 14, there is a 30% chance of decreasing the countdown timer by 1 more tick. Therefore, having at least 14 half-beds and/or iron bars within range speeds up conversion by an average of 4.2%.[2]

During the curing process the zombie villager behaves like a normal zombie except that it gains Strength (with a potency that doesn't depend on the difficulty level). Thus, a zombie villager is more dangerous during curing than at other times.

At the end of the curing process, the zombie villager transforms into a villager and gains the Nausea effect for 10 seconds (which has no effect on the villager's behavior). If it was holding any item it picked up, that item is dropped (unless it was enchanted with Curse of Binding, in which case it remains in the villager's inventory but is not worn and does not drop if the villager is killed). If it was a baby before it was transformed into a zombie villager, it remains a baby after the cure. If it had traded with a player at least once, it recovers its former profession and inventory of trades. Otherwise, it recovers its profession but might immediately change it if it finds and claims a workstation block for a different profession.

A newly-cured villager, if it had a profession prior to being zombified, offers a trading discount to the player who administered the cure. These discounts are permanent. If a villager is cured more than once, no additional discounts are applied. Villagers near the cured villager are also affected but offer fewer, smaller discounts.

Zombie villagers that are in the process of converting do not despawn if the player moves far away from them, but like all monsters, they despawn if the difficulty is changed to Peaceful.
