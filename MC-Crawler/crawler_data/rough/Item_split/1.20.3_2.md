### General
** Custom structure **
- Changes to structure type definitions (data/minecraft/worldgen/structure):
	- Added optionalpool_aliaseslist to jigsaw structures.
	- Aliases represent the possibility to rewire jigsaw pool connections by redirecting pool references on individual structure instances.
	- Alias variants are represented intypeand is one of:
		- direct: 1:1 mapping from an alias to a new pool.
			- alias: Pool to replace.
			- target: Pool to replace with.
		- random: 1:n mapping where a pool fromnis randomly selected for the structure instance.
			- alias: Pool to replace.
			- targets: Randomized list of candidate pools to replacealiaswith.
		- random_group
			- groups: Each group is a randomized list of above alias types.
			- Only one group is selected per structure instance.
			- This enables modelling selections such as "if pool X is replaced with X1, also replace pool Y with Y1".

### Additions
#### Blocks
** Chiseled Copper **
- Have 8 variants in 4 oxidation levels, waxed or not waxed.
- Can be crafted both incrafting tableandstonecutter:
	- When in crafting table, consume 2cut copper slabsfrom the same type, resulting in 1 chiseled copper with the same type.
	- When in stonecutter, consume 1block of copper, resulting in 4 chiseled copper, or 1cut copper, resulting in 1 chiseled copper; all from the same type.

** Copper Bulb **
- A light-emitting block that can toggle its light emission through redstone pulses.
- Have 8 variants in 4 oxidation levels, waxed or not waxed.
- Can be crafted in crafting table with a cross pattern, by 3 blocks of copper from the same type, 1blaze rodin the center slot, and 1redstone dustin the bottom slot, resulting in 1 copper bulb with the same type.
- They emit less light the more oxidized they are. From less oxidized to most oxidized, they emit block light levels of 15, 12, 8, and 4, respectively.
- While powered by a redstone signal, a redstone crystal in the center of them will glow.
- They have following properties:
	- Only toggle their light on or off when receiveing a redstone pulse. Their state will not be changed if the source of the redstone pulse is removed.
	- When the light is on, redstone comparators will read a redstone signal strength of 15.
	- Don't conduct redstone power.

** Copper Door and Copper Trapdoor **
- Have 8 variants in 4 oxidation levels, waxed or not waxed.
- Works like wooden doors in that they can be opened and closed by the player as well as redstone.
- Can be crafted as other doors, with blocks of copper from the same type (instead ofingots, as iniron doors).

** Copper Grate **
- A new type of decorative block unique to the copper family.
- Have 8 variants in 4 oxidation levels, waxed or not waxed.
- Can be crafted both in crafting table and stonecutter:
	- When in crafting table, consume 4 blocks of copper from the same type in rhombic pattern, resulting in 1 copper grate with the same type.
	- When in stonecutter, consume 1 block of copper, resulting in 4 copper grate from the same type.
- They are transparent, so they allow light to pass through and cannot conduct redstone, prevent mob spawning on top of them, and do not suffocate mobs who end up with their head inside them.
- Can bewaterlogged.
	- Acts similarly to waterloggedmangrove roots; water will not flow out of any of the block's faces.

** Crafter **
- A variant ofcrafting table, can be crafted with fiveiron ingots, a crafting table, tworedstone dusts, and adropperin the crafting table.
- Crafters can be oriented in any direction when placed.
- Apickaxecan increase the speed of mining them.
- Have a user interface similar to crafting table.
	- Have 3Ã—3 interactable crafting grid.
	- Their crafting grid slots are toggleable, meaning that the player can change the behavior of a slot by clicking or pressing on a slot with an empty hand.
		- A toggled slot cannot hold any items and therefore cannot have items placed into it by other blocks such ashoppersand droppers.
		- A toggled slot can be toggled off by player, whether clicked directly or holding item(s), pressing slot keys associated with an empty or a not empty hotbar slot.
	- Unlike the crafting table, the slots display a preview of the crafted item which will be crafted and ejected on the next redstone pulse, but cannot be manually taken out by the player.
	- The user interface is shared between all players interacting with them, meaning that multiple players can interact with them at the same time, similar tochestsand hoppers.
	- The user interface does not have arecipe bookto provide help, so the player must know the recipes.
- The crafter ejects one crafted item at a time when powered by a new redstone pulse, a redstone signal that is not a continuous signal.
	- Upon receiving this new signal, crafters eject the recipe result from the front face.
	- All the result items will be ejected together when the output result has multiple type of items.
- They can interact with hoppers and droppers, to input/output automatically.
	- Hoppers can be used to both insert and pull items out of them.
	- Droppers can be used to insert items into them.
	- Moving items in from another block with a hopper or a dropper prioritizes filling items into slots, by following these rules:
		- If there is a toggled slot, skipped.
		- If there is not a toggled slot, crafters prioritize the first empty slot from left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
		- If there is not a toggled slot, and there are no empty slots, crafters prioritize the smallest stack of the same item. If there are multiple possible stacks, pick the first from left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
	- If failed to select a slot, hoppers and droppers will not take any action.
- When read by aredstone comparator, the redstone signal strength is 0 to 9, where each non-empty or toggled slot adds 1 strength.

** Trial Spawner **
- Trial spawner is a new variant ofmonster spawnersthat ejects rewards upon completion and can have variable levels of challenge in multiplayer.
- The challenge level will increase for each new player a trial spawner notices nearby.
	- Challenge level will not decrease until it is reset during a trial spawner's cooldown.
- Unlike normal spawners, a trial spawner will spawn a limited number of mobs proportional to its current challenge level.
	- It can only spawn a mob at positions that are within line of sight.
	- It can spawn a mob regardless of any light level requirement the mob has.
	- Spawned mobs are persistent and will not despawn.
- Once all mobs are defeated, the trial spawner will eject a set of rewards proportional to the current challenge level.
	- After the rewards have been ejected, the trial spawner goes into cooldown for 30 minutes during which it will no longer spawn mobs.
- Trial spawners cannot be crafted nor obtained by players in Survival - instead, they can be found naturally placed throughout trial chambers.
- Trial spawners are extremely slow to mine and resistant to explosions, and will not drop even withSilk Touch.
- When placed in Creative, trial spawners have no mob type set by default.
	- The mob type can be set by interacting with it while holding a spawn egg.
- Creative and Spectator players cannot be detected or noticed by trial spawners.
