#### Banner item textures
During the Java Edition 1.8 snapshots, starting with Java Edition 14w30a, there were two unused item textures, "banner_base" and "banner_overlay", probably intended to be used together as a recolorable inventory icon for banners. The texture for "banner_base" was removed in 16w41a and the texture "banner_overlay" was removed in 17w47a.

- The base texture.
- The overlay texture.
- Both textures put together.


#### Crystallized honey
A texture for a crystallized honey item was added to the game files in 19w34a. This texture was removed in 19w42a, as it was never actually intended to be used.[10]






### Unused
#### Unused potions
Bedrock Edition has unused potion textures for several effects, along with their splash variants. These effects are: Absorption, Blindness, Haste, Health Boost, Hunger, Mining Fatigue, Nausea, Resistance, Saturation, and Levitation, as well as the Luck potion textures also present in Java Edition. These unused textures were added along with the other potion textures in Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha, except for the potion of levitation, which was added in Pocket Edition 1.0.0. The textures were changed along with the other potion textures during the texture update in Bedrock Edition 1.10.0. Strangely, the potion of levitation texture is a duplicate of the splash potion of levitation texture.

char_2.png is a texture that could be found in the jar file for the first Indev build released on February 12, 2010. The texture is mostly identical to that of Steve, with the difference being the presence of two yellow pixels on the head, as well as hair being present in the hat layer as well as the base. It was removed two days later.

On 3 June 2010, Notch discussed on his blog plans to add different types of furniture to the game, which included doors. These postings include discussions of implementing said furniture in the form of entities as opposed to blocks, as was previously done for paintings in Indev, with Notch also stating his successful reimplementation of signs the previous day[23] as a block entity.[24] If implemented as a block entity, this would allow doors to have a smooth opening and closing animation,[24] similarly to what was added for chests a bit over a year later by converting them from normal blocks.

Doors were ultimately added on the 7th of June, 2010, as a relatively normal block, which would instantly open or close when interacted with, having no continuous animation in the process as had been mentioned. However, the /item directory in minecraft.jar, which stored the textures for other non-mob entities at that time such as minecarts and arrows, gained a texture called door.png in this same version, which is without a doubt linked to said opening/closing animation. An early iteration of the oak door can be seen in it, with empty space filled out in solid purple in a fashion resembling the placeholder texture from terrain.png and kz.png as well as the checkerboard missing texture.





An interesting thing to note about this door texture is the absence of any windows, a significant difference from the door actually implemented in the June 7th Infdev build, the top half of which does have a transparent window. The item form, however, still did not have a window in it until Alpha v1.0.1.

- The oak door item from the June 7th build of Infdev
- The oak door item in Alpha v1.0.1

This door entity texture was one of many unused textures removed in 13w24a with the reconfiguring of game assets and the introduction of resource packs as the successor to texture packs.
