## Obtaining
### Mining
Emerald ore drops one emerald when mined using an iron pickaxe or better. If the pickaxe is enchanted with Fortune, it may drop an extra emerald per level of Fortune, up to a maximum of 4 emeralds with Fortune III. If the ore is mined using a pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch, it drops itself in ore form instead of an emerald.

### Trading
Main article: Trading
Emeralds can be obtained by trading with villagers, since they are the currency that villagers use for trading. Villagers either buy or sell specific goods for emeralds.

### Mob loot
Vindicators and evokers drop 0–1 emeralds upon death. Looting increases the maximum emerald drop by one per level, for a maximum of 4 emeralds with Looting III.

Foxes that are holding emeralds also have a chance of 100% to drop the emerald they are holding upon death. Alternatively, the player can drop a food item to entice the fox to drop the emerald without killing it.

In Bedrock Edition, vindicators and pillagers spawned from raids can drop 0–1 emeralds. Depending on difficulty, vindicators and pillagers spawned from raids also have a chance of dropping additional emeralds. There is a 65% chance of dropping on Easy and Normal, and an 80% chance of dropping on Hard. If this additional drop condition is met, different emerald counts can drop with different chances. There is a 10⁄39 chance to drop an additional 0–1 emeralds, a 5⁄39 chance to drop an additional 2–3, and a 2⁄39 chance to drop an additional 4–5.

In Bedrock Edition, with Looting III, it is possible for a vindicator in a raid to drop up to 16 emeralds upon death (vindicator drops + raid drops + an additional drop).
