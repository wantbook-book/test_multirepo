### Rain particles
Rain particles make noise when they hit a block, and this noise can be heard at any point within 16 blocks. These particles (along with the associated sound) can be disabled by setting particles to "Minimal" in the video settings menu.â€Œ[Java Edition  only] Although rain particles are visible just in the immediate vicinity, their effects occur within all loaded areas. Note that raindrops fall only in the two middle lines of a block, thus do not visibly fall directly onto the player. At y=1 and below, rain does not generate particles and the associated sound event.
