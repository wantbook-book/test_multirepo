# Creative
Creative mode is one of the main game modes in Minecraft. Creative mode strips away the survival aspects of Minecraft and allows players to easily create and destroy structures and mechanisms with the inclusion of an infinite use of blocks and flying. It also changes some of the background music.

## Gameplay

### Destroying
Creative mode allows players to destroy all blocks instantly (including normally indestructible blocks such as bedrock, end portal frames, etc.), provided they are not holding a sword, trident or debug stick‌[JE  only]. However, these blocks are not dropped and must be obtained from the Creative inventory, or by using pick block on the block.

When continuously holding destroy to break blocks in Creative mode, there is a 6 game tick (0.3 second) cooldown between each block broken. This is distinct from instant mining in Survival mode, where one block can be broken every game tick (0.05 second). This cooldown can be bypassed by rapidly clicking the destroy button, allowing blocks to be broken as quickly as the player clicks.

Blocks directly broken by the player do not drop any resource; the only exceptions are shulker boxes and beehives if they have non-default NBT data. Containers also drop their contents when broken. Blocks broken indirectly (for example, a torch attached to the block that is being broken, or blocks destroyed by an explosion) drop item resources as in other game modes. Infested blocks do not spawn silverfish when destroyed directly by the player.

#### Reach
Players in Creative have a longer reach for placing, destroying, and attacking than in Survival.

| Edition                         | Reach in Creative mode | Reach in other game modes |
|---------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Java Edition                    | 5.2 blocks             | 4.5 blocks                |
| Bedrock(keyboard or controller) | 5 blocks               | 5 blocks                  |
| Bedrock(touch controls)         | 12 blocks              | 6 blocks                  |

### Flying
Main article: Flying
Creative mode gives players the ability to fly. To activate flying, double tap the jump key. Use the jump key to go up and the sneak key to go down, and the movement controls to move. The player can disable flying in mid-air by double-tapping jump again, causing them to drop to the ground. Touching the ground when flying disables flying in Java Edition, but not in Bedrock Edition. Getting into a minecart, or bed does not disable flying. However, getting into a boat or riding a mob such as pig, llama, horse, donkey, mule, skeleton horse, strider, trader llama or camel disables flying.

### Invincibility
In Creative mode, players have no visible health or hunger bar to hamper their building since they are invincible (though it is still possible to eat).

Players in Creative mode are unable to receive damage from the vast majority of sources. In Java Edition, going too far into the void still kills the player; however, in Bedrock Edition, the player is also immune to this (they are stopped by an invisible barrier that exists in all three dimensions). The player can fly around in the void provided they do not descend more than 64 blocks below the bottom of the dimension. In Java Edition, the void, the /kill and /damage commands, as well as external editors, are the only way to die in Creative mode. Creative players in Bedrock Edition are completely invulnerable.

### Mobs
Mobs still spawn as they do in other game modes, unless the difficulty is Peaceful or when the game rule doMobSpawning is set to false, but all are passive toward the players. Zombies summoned by others calling for backup attempt to attack the player, but they still cause no harm, and they stop attacking after several seconds. The player can still ignite creepers with a flint and steel or fire charge. Mobs killed by the player in Creative still drop items, but most other entities do not.

### Switching to Creative mode
Once a world is created, if cheats are enabled, the game mode can be manually changed to Creative (or other game modes) with either the /gamemode command, specifically by typing /gamemode creative. In Java Edition, the game mode switcher (F3 + F4) can also be used. In multiplayer, players can be individually changed between game modes with the /gamemode command available to operators. This means that individual players can play Creative mode (at the operator's discretion) on a Survival map, or vice-versa. The default game mode for new players can also be changed with the /defaultgamemode command.
