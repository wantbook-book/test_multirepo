# Explorer Map
Explorer maps are special maps used to aid in finding ocean monuments, woodland mansions, trial chambers‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0], and buried treasures.

If the experiment for the Villager Trade Rebalance is enabled, the following structures can also be located by explorer maps: jungle pyramids, swamp huts, and desert, plains, savanna, snowy and taiga villages.

## Obtaining
### Trading
Cartographer villagers sell various explorer maps depending on their level. Each explorer map costs 1 compass, and a number of emeralds. The emerald cost can vary, but the compass cost is fixed.

1. ↑The types of map sold by a villager depend on the biome it spawned it. More information in Trading.

If the cartographer is in the Nether or the End, either spawned or transported, the trades for the map do not unlock. If the world does not generate a particular structure, trades for the map for that structure also do not unlock.

In Java Edition, each cartographer sells its own unique explorer map that points to a different location than other cartographers. Purchasing another explorer map from the same cartographer results in the same explorer map. In Bedrock Edition, a cartographer sells an explorer map that points to the nearest location,[more information needed] regardless of whether it has been explored or previously mapped by another cartographer.

In Bedrock Edition, if cartographer map trades are unlocked in an old world, the game stops ticking.

### Chest loot
In contrast to explorer maps, buried treasure maps (Java Edition) or treasure maps (Bedrock Edition) generate in underwater ruins or in shipwrecks.

### Locating structures
There are three types of explorer maps: ocean, woodland, trial chambers,‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0] and buried treasure. The maps differ from a normal map, in that it shows the area's land-water outline, with an orange striated (striped) texture for water[1], and the blank map texture for land. The maps show a section of land that contains an ocean monument, woodland mansion, trial chambers, or buried treasure respectively.

In the experimental "Villager Trade Rebalance" data pack, there are seven additional explorer maps: jungle maps that show a jungle pyramid, swamp maps that show a swamp hut, as well as maps for desert, plains, savanna, snowy and taiga villages.

The structure shown may not be the nearest such structure to the player. The structures are displayed as a small icon. If the player icon is smaller than it would be on a normal map, that means the player is a great distance away. When the player is less than 1027 blocks away from the map border, the icon returns to the proper size. When the player reaches the map's area of land (512×512), the map fills in like a normal map.

The basic functions of a buried treasure explorer map are similar to that of the others. However, instead of showing the structure icon on the map, it shows a red X instead. The buried treasure chest is located on the same X and Z coordinates as the middle of the X (the player marker may need to be aligned with the bottom of the middle 2×2 pixel square of the X). To locate the chest spot, hold the treasure map with both hands, not in the offhand slot.
