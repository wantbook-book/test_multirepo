## Creative inventory
Main article: Creative inventory
Creative mode item selection screen (opened to the search tab)
In Creative mode, the inventory contains a block selection menu containing all blocks and items found in survival, plus a few additional items not obtainable in Survival. The blocks and items are organized into various tabs that differ slightly between Java and Bedrock.


## External inventories
Many blocks and some non-player entities have their own inventory-like windows that pop up to allow manipulation of items.

Note: Despite the fact that ender chest, crafting table, beacon, anvil, enchanting table, and villager inventories are actually internal behind the scenes, they are listed here as external because they require clicking on something external.
