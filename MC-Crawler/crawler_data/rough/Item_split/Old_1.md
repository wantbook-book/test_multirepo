### Nether and End
In Old worlds, the Nether and the End could not be accessed unless the world was converted to the Infinite type, as detailed below.

However, the Nether and End actually existed in this world type but the only way to access these dimensions was via command /setblock or /fill with the corresponding portal, just like the Overworld.

Both Nether and End were also bordered with the size 256×128×256.
The Nether still generated normally, but the 8:1 travel ratio was maintained, meaning that returning to the Overworld caused the player to become stuck (due to the Overworld being 256×128×256 in size).

If a nether fortress was generated, it was most likely going to be cut down by the world border.
Despite nether portals not being able to be activated, returning from the Nether to the Overworld caused a newly activated Nether portal to generate in the overworld (this is due to nether portals not counting when placed with commands).

The End in Old worlds generated only the central island without the outer islands. Sometimes the end fountain did not generate and the Ender Dragon sometimes got stuck at the border. End gateway portals also didn't work.

## Converting to infinite
To convert an Old world to an Infinite type, all the player had to do was to select the pencil icon next to the old world in the world selection screen, and then selected "Make Infinite!". This created a new world with all of the saved data (inventory, terrain, structures, etc.) of the old world, set the world type to Infinite, and kept the world name; the old world is then renamed <WorldName>-Old.

After converting to Infinite, the terrain copied from the old world had a terrain wall separating it from the added area, as infinite worlds generate larger biomes.

This process is not available in Minecraft China.
