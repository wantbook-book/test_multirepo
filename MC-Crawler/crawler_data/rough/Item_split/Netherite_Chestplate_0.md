A chestplate can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the chestplate' maximum durability, rounded down. Two chestplates of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the chestplate's enchantments.

### Natural generation
Two armor stands are found in each taiga village outdoor armory, one of them equipped with an iron chestplate.
