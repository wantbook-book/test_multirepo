#### Unit repair
Main article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair
Repair & NameDamaged Iron Helmet
An iron helmet can be repaired in an anvil by adding iron ingots, with each ingot restoring 25% the helmet's maximum durability, rounded down. Two iron helmets can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the helmet's enchantments.

### Natural generation
Two armor stands are found in each taiga village outdoor armory, one of them equipped with an iron helmet.

1. ↑ a bEnchantment probabilities are the same as a level-20 to level-39 enchantment would be on an enchantment table that had no cap at level 30, and that was able to apply treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and where the chance of multiple enchantments is not reduced.

### Mob loot
Zombies, husks, skeletons, strays, bogged, piglins, and zombified piglins have a small chance to spawn wearing armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the helmet they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an ominous trial spawner. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.

In Bedrock Edition, vindicators and pillagers spawned in raids have a 4.16% chance (5.128% on hard difficulty) to drop an iron helmet. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and has a 50% chance of being enchanted with a random enchantment.

### Trading
In Java Edition, novice-level armorer villagers have a 40% chance to sell an iron helmet for 4 emeralds.

In Bedrock Edition, novice-level armorer villagers have a 25% chance to sell iron helmet for 5 emeralds

## Usage
Helmets can be placed in the top armor slot of a player's inventory for activation.
