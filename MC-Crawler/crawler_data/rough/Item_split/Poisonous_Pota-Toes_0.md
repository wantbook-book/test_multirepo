### Void
After falling into the void in Potato dimension, player spawns high above their normal spawnpoint, wearing poisonous pota-toes. 

## Usage
Poisonous pota-toes can be equipped in the 4th armor slot like any other boots. They don't provide any armor points, but instead protect the player from falling. Poisonous pota-toes break when the player would receive any fall damage, and place poisonous mashed potato around the player, negating all the damage. One layer of poisonous mashed potato is always placed directly below the player.

Poisonous pota-toes can be stacked, and are used up one by one if the player has multiple equipped.
