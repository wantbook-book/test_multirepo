# Pickaxe
A pickaxe is a tool required to mine ores, rock-based blocks and metal-based blocks quickly and obtain them as items. A pickaxe mines faster and can obtain more block types as items depending on the material it is made from.

### Upgrading
Like other diamond tools, a diamond pickaxe can be upgraded to a netherite pickaxe, increasing its durability and slightly increasing its mining speed, as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item.

Main article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair
Pickaxes can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tier's repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% of the pickaxe's maximum durability, rounded down.

1. ↑ a b c dEnchantment probabilities are the same as a level-20 to level-39 enchantment would be on an enchantment table that had no cap at level 30, and that was able to apply treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and where the chance of multiple enchantments is not reduced.
2. ↑ a b c d e fAll enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.

### Mob loot
In Bedrock Edition, pillagers and vindicators have a chance of dropping a damaged iron pickaxe when killed during a raid. The pickaxe has a 50% chance of being enchanted with random enchantment(s).

### Trading
In Bedrock Edition, novice-level toolsmith villagers have a 25% chance to sell stone pickaxes for one emerald, Journeyman-level toolsmith villagers have a 25% chance to sell enchanted iron pickaxes for 3 emeralds, and master-level toolsmith villagers always sell enchanted diamond pickaxes for 13 emeralds.

In Java Edition, novice-level toolsmith villagers have a 40% chance to sell a stone pickaxe for one emerald, journeyman-level toolsmith villagers have a 40% chance to sell an enchanted iron pickaxe for 7–22 emeralds, and a master-level toolsmith always sells an enchanted diamond pickaxe for 18–35 emeralds.

The enchantments are the same as the ones obtained from an enchantment table at levels 5–19.
