### Weaknesses and immunities
Some mobs are weak or immune to certain kinds of damage. Sea creatures, such as turtles, take more damage from tridents that are enchanted with Impaling.‌[Java Edition  only]‌[until JE Combat Tests] Skeletons and their variants are immune to drowning. All undead mobs are healed by potions of Harming, but take extra damage from weapons enchanted with Smite, along with taking damage from Potions of Healing. Many of these weaknesses and immunities are a result of what category (see below) of mobs that the mob falls into.

### Undead mobs
A dying zombie.
Main article: Undead
This group of mobs includes bogged‌[upcoming: JE 1.21], drowned, old zombie villagers, husks, phantoms, skeletons, skeleton horses, strays, withers, wither skeletons, zoglins, zombies, zombie horses, zombie villagers, and zombified piglins. These mobs are damaged by potions of Healing, healed by potions of Harming, and are immune to drowning (except for husks and zombies, which turn into zombies and drowned if drowning, respectively) and poison damage. Zombies, zombie villagers, drowned, skeletons, strays, and phantoms burn when under direct sunlight, unless they are touching water or wearing a helmet. Under the Fire Resistance effect, undead mobs still catch fire in direct sunlight but do not get hurt by the fire. All undead mobs except for drowned, phantoms, and withers sink in water. All undead mobs take extra damage from weapons enchanted with Smite, and are ignored by withers.

Most undead mobs have the ability to pick up items. Some can spawn wearing armor, or holding tools or weapons.

### Aquatic mobs
A dolphin chasing a raw cod.
Main article: Aquatic
This group of mobs includes axolotls, dolphins, squids, glow squids, guardians, elder guardians, tadpoles, turtles, cod, salmon, pufferfish, and tropical fish, but not drowned.[5] They take extra damage from tridents enchanted with Impaling,‌[Java Edition  only]‌[until JE Combat Tests] and, except axolotl, do not cause pufferfish to inflate nor take damage from them. All aquatic mobs except dolphins are immune to drowning, and all except guardians, elder guardians, and turtles take suffocation damage if out of water for too long. Aquatic mobs have the ability to swim, whereas other mobs simply float on water or sink.
In Bedrock Edition there is no in-game classification for these mobs.

### Arthropods
A spider.
Main article: Arthropods
This group consists of mobs based on arthropods, namely bees, cave spiders, endermites, silverfish, and spiders. They take extra damage and receive the Slowness IV effect when attacked with weapons enchanted with Bane of Arthropods.

### Illagers
Illagers attacking villagers on a raid
Main article: Illager
This group includes pillagers, illusioners‌[JE  only], evokers, and vindicators. They are immune to evoker fangs damage and ignored by vindicators named "Johnny". They are hostile toward adult villagers, wandering traders, iron golems and players in Survival or Adventure mode. Ravagers, witches, and vexes accompany them in raids but are not illagers themselves. Illusioners (and witches‌[Bedrock Edition  only]) can see players or targets through blocks.

### Knockback resistance
Some non-boss mobs resist a percentage of knockback from attacks.
