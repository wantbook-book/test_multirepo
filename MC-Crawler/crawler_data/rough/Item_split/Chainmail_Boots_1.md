### Mob loot
Zombies, husks, skeletons, strays, bogged, piglins, and zombified piglins have a small chance to spawn wearing armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the boots they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an ominous trial spawner. The dropped boots are usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.

Zombie is shown wearing full iron armor set, including boots.
In Bedrock Edition, vindicators and pillagers spawning in raids have a 4.16% chance (5.128% on hard difficulty) to drop iron boots. The dropped boots are usually badly damaged, and have a 50% chance of being enchanted with a random enchantment.

### Trading
In Java Edition, novice-level armorer villagers have 40% chance to sell iron boots for 4 emeralds. Apprentice-level armorers have a 50% chance to sell chainmail boots for an emerald. Expert-level armorers always sell enchanted[note 1] diamond boots for 11–27 emeralds. Apprentice-level leatherworker villagers have 2⁄3 chance to sell leather boots for 4 emeralds.

Armorer villagers may give the players with the Hero of the Village effect chainmail boots.‌[Java Edition  only]

1. ↑ a bWhen creating an enchantment offer, the game uses a random enchantment level from 5 – 19. The enchantments are never treasure enchantments.

### Bartering
Piglins may barter iron boots with Soul Speed when given a gold ingot.

### Fishing
Leather boots can be caught as a "junk" item when fishing.

## Usage
Boots can be placed in the fourth armor slot of a player's inventory for activation.

### Defense points
Defense points are each signified by half of a chestplate in the armor bar above the health bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.

The following table shows the amount of defense points added by boots.

| Material  | Defense points |
|-----------|----------------|
| Leather   | 1 ()           |
| Golden    |                |
| Chainmail |                |
| Iron      | 2 ()           |
| Diamond   | 3 ()           |
| Netherite |                |

### Knockback resistance
Netherite boots provide 10% knockback resistance.

### Durability
The following table shows the amount of damage each piece of armor can absorb before being destroyed.

Any "hit" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken that armor doesn't protect (such as falling or drowning) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits boots can endure.

Netherite armor is not damaged by lava or fire when worn.

| Material       | Durability |
|----------------|------------|
| Leather        | 65         |
| Golden         | 91         |
| Chainmail/Iron | 195        |
| Diamond        | 429        |
| Netherite      | 481        |
