# History of textures/Unused textures
This page documents textures which are or once were present within Minecraft, but are not actually used.

In specific, only textures which themselves were fully unused are documented here. Disused textures which were used for a given feature in previous versions are not listed here, nor are textures which became used in a version after the texture itself was added, even if the texture in question was changed first (examples being cobwebs, crying obsidian, the original end stone texture, the original two sandstone texture variants, and the pigman, which was later retconned to the piglin). Unused duplicates of textures are generally also not listed here unless tied to another unused texture or being changed later down the line.

A much more quantitative, but less analytical, list of unused textures of varying levels of notability can be found here.

## Blocks
### Removed
#### Classic white texture
In the versions of terrain.png used between 0.0.14a and 0.0.14a_08 there is a white texture which was not used in any in-game block. It may have been an early experimental snow texture, as Notch had stated interest in adding snow and ice before this point,[1] or it could relate to clouds, as they were added in the same version. This texture was removed from terrain.png in 0.0.15a.






#### Brick texture variations
In the versions of terrain.png used between 0.26 SURVIVAL TEST and 0.30 inclusive, there existed four textures very similar to the existing bricks texture, although with subtle differences. These textures were removed from terrain.png at the start of Indev.

#### Chair textures
From Indev 20100206 to Infdev 20100627 two textures were present in terrain.png which were based off of the oak planks texture. The first texture is commonly recognised to be the side view of a chair, and the other texture is often interpreted as being either the front view of a chair or a side a table, although the latter was never mentioned by Notch and as such this interpretation remains speculative.

Indev 20100206 also added a duplicate oak planks texture. This may have been intended to be used for such blocks as well (as the back or seat portion), or it may have simply been the texture copied for the other two textures to be cut from,mars said textures are clearly oak planks derivatives. This was removed earlier than the other two textures in Infdev 20100607.

In Infdev 20100618, the chair texture specifically changed to be slightly darker. The door and ladder textures, which were relatively close to it on terrain.png, were also darkened in that version, and the second texture remained completely untouched.

- The original chair side texture.
- The darkened chair side texture.
- The chair front texture.
- The duplicated wooden planks texture.
- Recreated possible model of a chair using all 3 textures.
- Recreated possible model of a table using front texture.

During the period of time where these textures existed in terrain.png, Notch made multiple statements of plans to implement chairs,[2][3] alongside mentions of other furniture (like doors, signs, ladders and chairs).[4][5]

Intriguingly, these textures were added in the exact same version as wheat crops and farming mechanics were. Crops of invalid data values (8 and beyond, as wheat normally only grows to 7) would overflow to the next line of terrain.png, due to how wheat models and texture selection were defined at the time. Data values 11 and 12 specifically happened to use the exact spots where these two textures were positioned, resulting in wheat with these data values appearing as rather broken chairs.

- Wheat with age 11 used chair side texture.
- Wheat with age 11 used Darkened chair side texture.
- Wheat with age 12 used chair front texture.

Mojang have since rejected the idea of adding "furniture" blocks to the game, as their existence would "inhibit natural creativity".[6]


#### Possible coral texture
In Infdev 20100629, a texture was added to terrain.png of completely unknown use. This texture was composed of several transparent, black, white and various shades of gray pixels. This texture was removed in Alpha v1.0.4 with its position being taken by the snowy grass block side texture.

The addition of this texture to terrain.png roughly coincides with Notch mentioning an attempt to add coral blocks to the game, according to a post on The Word of Notch documenting a failed attempt to draw a realistic-looking coral block texture.[7] The texture's hyperbolic appearance does in fact resemble the early iterations of coral blocks showcased at Minecon in 2017.
