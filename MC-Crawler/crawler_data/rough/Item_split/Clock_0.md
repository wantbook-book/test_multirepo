## Usage
Clock animation
The clock dial consists of two halves, a day side and a night side. The dial spins clockwise slowly to indicate the time of day, corresponding to the sun or moon's actual position in the sky. When the time of day changes suddenly, such as after sleeping or when /time is used, the clock dial spins rapidly to catch up. The player is able to sleep a few seconds after the clock shows exactly dusk.

The dial always shows the current in-game time when in the Overworld, regardless of where it appears. This includes a player's hand, an inventory slot, a crafting grid, an item frame, or even as a dropped item. For a clock to be mounted on a wall, an item frame is required.

Because there is no day/night cycle in the Nether or the End, clocks do not work properly in these dimensions. Instead, the dial rotates rapidly and randomly. Although clocks do not function in these dimensions, the actual daylight cycle does continue.

In Java Edition, a clock can be viewed under the item statistics page as long as one obtained a clock at some point.

### Piglins
Piglins are attracted to clocks and run toward any clock on the ground, and inspect it for 6 to 8 seconds before putting it in their inventory.
