## Obtaining
A bucket of tropical fish can be obtained by using a water bucket on a tropical fish. Once a water bucket is used, the tropical fish is picked up along with the water source block.

### Trading
Wandering traders have 1⁄6 chance to sell a bucket of tropical fish for 5 emeralds. When placed, a bucket of tropical fish bought from a wandering trader has a random variant.

## Usage
Pressing use with a bucket of tropical fish places a water source block, and spawns the tropical fish back into the world, leaving an empty bucket in the player's inventory. Placing a bucket of tropical fish in the Nether causes the same particles to appear that generate when a normal water bucket is placed in the Nether, and the tropical fish is spawned alone.

Tropical fish caught in buckets then released do not despawn, unlike mobs that spawn naturally in their aquatic environments.

If a bucket of tropical fish is inside a dispenser, the dispenser spawns the tropical fish and water block in front of it upon activation, leaving an empty bucket inside. Dispensers cannot pick up tropical fish with water buckets (the bucket is emptied).

If a bucket of tropical fish is named a certain name through an anvil, the tropical fish inside displays that name as if it were named with a name tag.‌[Java Edition  only] Alternatively, if a named tropical fish is captured with a bucket of water, the resulting bucket of tropical fish shares a name with the captured tropical fish.‌[Java Edition  only] If a named tropical fish is captured in Bedrock Edition, the item is called "Bucket of <Name>".

### Breeding
Additionaly, buckets of tropical fish may be used to breed and lead axolotls. It can also speed up the growth of a baby axolotl.

### Tropical fish variants
Tropical fish also have assigned names that can be seen after capture. In Java Edition, the smaller text under the item name is displayed showing the fish name, similar to the text that displays enchantments under enchanted items. In Bedrock Edition, the item name is displayed showing "Bucket of <fish name>". Their colors are mostly named according to the colored block names, though with a few exceptions:

- White
- Silver
- Gray
- Black
- Brown
- Red
- Orange
- Yellow
- Lime
- Green
- Teal
- Sky
- Blue
- Plum
- Magenta
- Rose

The base color comes first, and if the pattern color is different, it comes after that. Lastly, the fish bucket is given a name according to the shape and pattern of the fish:

| Flopper |  |  |  | Glitter |  |  |  | Betty     |  |  |  |          |
|---------|--|--|--|---------|--|--|--|-----------|--|--|--|----------|
|         |  |  |  | Stripey |  |  |  | Blockfish |  |  |  | Clayfish |

| Kob |  |  |  | Snooper   |  |  |  | Brinely |  |  |  |        |

|     |  |  |  | SunStreak |  |  |  | Dasher  |  |  |  | Spotty |

Some tropical fish don't follow the normal naming system, and instead, reference real-life fish species. Apart from these names, these types of fish aren't different from regular tropical fish in terms of design or behavior.

These varieties are:
