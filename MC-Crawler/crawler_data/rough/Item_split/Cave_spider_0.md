## Spawning
Size of a cave spider (left) compared to a regular spider (right).
Cave spiders spawn from monster spawners in mineshafts at a light level of 0. These monster spawners are surrounded by cobwebs in corridors.

‌In Java Edition 1.21 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.0‌[upcoming], cave spiders have a chance to be selected as the "small melee" mob for trial spawners in trial chambers.

## Behavior
Cave spiders inherit their behavior from spiders:

- Neutral if under daylight or inlightlevels of 12 or above, otherwise hostile toward players andiron golems. Once they become hostile, light does not affect them.
- Climb walls when needed.
- Attack by leaping.
- Are unaffected bycobwebsandPoison.
- Are scared ofarmadillos.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5]

They have some distinctions from regular spiders:

- Can fit through a space that is oneblockwide and1⁄2block tall.
- Can go through the spaces between two different types of (unconnected)fences.
- Cannot spawn withstatus effects.

Being arthropods, they are weak against weapons with the Bane of Arthropods enchantment.

### Poison
On Normal or Hard difficulty, cave spiders inflict Poison upon attacking.[1] On Normal difficulty, the Poison lasts for 7 seconds and causes 6 damage. On Hard difficulty, it lasts for 15 seconds and causes 12 × 6. Poison damage is not taken when the player's health is at 1.
