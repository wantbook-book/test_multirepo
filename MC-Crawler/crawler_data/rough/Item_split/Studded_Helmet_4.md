#### Pigman
An unused pigman texture was added in Java Edition Alpha v1.2.0 and later removed in Java Edition 13w24a.

#### villager.png
Villagers were added to Java Edition in the first Beta 1.9 prerelease, with their textures located together in a dedicated subfolder of the mob textures folder: /mob/villager. However, another texture was added in this version, called villager.png, which is directly in the mob folder itself rather than the villager subfolder. (It is not to be confused with the "generic" file also called villager.png which is located in the villager subfolder, which was later used for nitwits.) This texture is completely unused, and closely resembles Steve, but with significant modifications to fit a different entity model.





If this texture is applied to a villager through use of a custom texture pack, the overall appearance is glitchy, implying that the model it was intended to be used for had changed since, and was eventually developed into the villager model that was actually released.

- villager.png used as the texture for a villager using a texture pack
- How this texture was likely intended to look, applied to a speculative entity model

Along with many other unused textures, villager.png was removed in 13w24a when texture packs were succeeded by resource packs.


#### Early ender dragon textures
In Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4, two unused ender dragon textures, titled "body" and "dragon", were added, probably left over from an earlier phase in development, as they resemble other pre-release ender dragon textures that Notch shared on twitter. They were removed in Java Edition 1.6.1.

- The "body" texture.
- The "dragon" texture.


#### Skis
In 12w50a, a snapshot for Java Edition 1.4.6, a texture named skis.png was added to the game. 1.4.6 was released close to Christmas of 2012. The texture was never actually intended to be used, and instead added by Dinnerbone as a red herring.[25]





Like many other unused textures, it was removed in 13w24a with the switch to resource packs. The texture was once again reimplemented as a joke feature in 23w13a_or_b.

## Particles
### Removed
#### Light blue particles
In Beta 1.4, two blue particles were added to particles.png of completely unknown use. They visually resemble water droplets, possibly implying early plans to add the water dripping event later added in 1.0.0, or a change to existing water splash effects. These particle textures were eventually removed in 19w06a due to the splitting of particles.png into its constituent textures, with unused particle textures being removed outright.

The textures were also added to Pocket Edition in v0.1.0 alpha due to its particles.png being the same as the version from Beta 1.4. It existed in Bedrock Edition up to release 1.16.

It may be worth noting that these two particles also closely resemble the existing used "flame" and "lava" particles in shape, possibly hinting at a planned connection:

|      | flame | lava |
|------|-------|------|
| fire |       |      |
| blue |       |      |


#### Angry villager head
In 12w34a, a texture resembling an angry-looking villager head was added to particles.png. However, it remained unused. This texture was also removed in 19w06a due to being unused.

This unused texture was added to Pocket Edition in v0.12.1 alpha build 1 due to it changing to use a particles.png based on the one from 12w34a. It still exists in Bedrock Edition's particles.png as of 1.16.






### Unused
#### Elephant toothpaste

  

This section is missing information about Was this experiment also shown off at one of the minecon livestreams? Likely worth mentioning. 
Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page.


An unused particle called elephant_toothpaste.png was added to the chemistry pack of Education Edition in an unknown version.[more information needed] It appears to be a particle atlas similar to that of campfire smoke, recolored to appear lighter.

Elephant's toothpaste is a popular demonstration in introductory chemistry, but was later scrapped.






#### Soul lava
In an unknown build of Bedrock Edition 1.16.0,[more information needed] a "soul lava" particle was added to particles.png. It can be seen that this particle is to the "lava" particle texture what the soul flame particle is to the ordinary "flame" particle. It appears completely unused.





Unlike normal campfires, soul campfires do not emit any type of ember. This is due to there being no defined particle for a soul ember,[26] something which this texture would fill in. However, despite this, the texture is yet to make any appearance in Java Edition[26] and remains unused in Bedrock Edition.[27]

What was Notch saying in his blog around this time in relation to flowing liquids?. 
Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page.


In the 15 June 2010 Infdev release, a texture file named waterterrain.png was added to the jar file. Resembling terrain.png in name, dimensions and the use of similar lilac textures in empty spots, it featured a multitude of different directional symbols.

This was added in the same version that implemented new flowing mechanics for water and lava.





Ultimately, flowing liquids simply used a 32×32 texture each (which remained within terrain.png), rotated accordingly depending on the flow direction (which could be orthogonal, diagonal or knightwise, the last of which this sheet did not account for), and this file fell into disuse. It was eventually removed in Alpha v1.2.2 with the addition of texture pack support.
