## Obtaining
### Mob loot
Drowned have a 3%‌[JE  only] or 8%‌[BE  only] chance to spawn with a nautilus shell in their off-hand, and this nautilus shell always drops upon death.

### Fishing
Main article: Fishing § Junk and treasure
Nautilus shells can be rarely obtained as a treasure item from fishing. The drop chances of nautilus shells slightly increase with each level of Luck of the Sea on the player's fishing rod.

### Trading
Wandering traders may sell a nautilus shell for 5 emeralds each. This trade becomes locked after 5 are bought.

## Usage
In Bedrock Edition, a nautilus shell is one of the few items that can be held in the off-hand.
