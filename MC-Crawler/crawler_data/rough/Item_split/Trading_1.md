### Sale prices
Permanent discounts (observed prices may be higher or lower due to other temporary factors) Above image is no longer accurate from 1.20.2(Java) and 1.20.30(Bedrock)


For the default sale price of a specific trade, find the trade in the tables below.
The price of an item rises and falls depending on three factors. Items with a high price multiplier (0.2) are affected by these changes more than items with a low multiplier (0.05). All price fluctuations affect only the first item involved in trade; for example, for an initial trade of 32 sticks for 1 emerald, the price might be driven down to 1 stick or up to 64 sticks for 1 emerald, but never for 2 emeralds. Additionally, no quantity can go lower than 1 or higher than the stack size.

The first factor is demand. An item that was sold out gets a price increase for all players when resupplied. If a player does not trade for a higher-priced item, the price is reduced the next time the villager resupplies. Demand is tracked per item, not per villager, so a villager can offer a higher-priced trade for a single item while other items are cheaper. Trades that have a price multiplier of 0 are not affected by demand.

The second way to affect prices is the Hero of the Village effect, which temporarily reduces prices for the affected player depending on the level of the effect.

Finally, players get personal discounts or fines based on their reputation with that particular villager. A positive reputation is gained by curing zombie villagers (the villager that was cured gives a permanent discount much larger than the temporary discount in nearby villagers). To cure a zombie villager, a player must splash it with a splash potion or an arrow of Weakness and then feed it a golden apple. The permanent discount is capped at one cure, while the temporary discount is capped at 8 cures. In Java Edition, players can also gain negative reputation by hitting or killing villagers, and positive reputation by trading.

## Non-trading villagers
If the player attempts to trade with a non-trading villager in Java Edition, they grunt and shake their head.

### Nitwit
A nitwit shaking its head.
Nitwits are green-coated villagers. They cannot gain a profession.

While they can be used for breeding, it is not possible to get a baby nitwit by breeding, even if using two nitwits as adults.


### Unemployed villager
An unemployed villager shaking its head.
Villagers without a job overlay cannot trade. They only wear their biome outfits. An unemployed villager gains a profession by claiming an unclaimed job site block. For example, an unclaimed cartography table converts an unemployed villager into a cartographer when the villager claims it, and both the villager and the table emit green particles. An inaccessible (or destroyed) job site block causes the connected villager to lose its profession, but that does not affect the player's popularity in the village.
