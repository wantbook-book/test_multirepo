A shovel can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the shovel's maximum durability, rounded down. Two shovels of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the shovel's enchantments.

### Chest loot
On ancient_city/city_center/city_center_2, they generate a furnace with a wooden shovel inside of it.

#### Equipment
Main article: Drops § Equipped items
Zombies and husks have a 0.67% (3.33% in Hard difficulty) chance of spawning with an iron shovel. They have an 8.5% (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) chance of dropping that shovel if they are killed by the player. The dropped shovel is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted: 0%–25% on Normal difficulty and 3.125%–25% on Hard difficulty, varying with regional difficulty, and enchanted as if on an enchanting table at level 5–22.
