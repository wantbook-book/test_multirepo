#### Items
** Spawn Egg **
- Added breeze spawn egg.

** Trial Key **
- An item that can only be obtained from trial spawners.

#### Mobs
** Breeze **
- The breeze is a cunning, hostile mob that can spawn via trial spawner in some rooms within the trial chambers.
- Has 30Ã— 15health points.
- Cannot be hit byarrowsortridents.
- The breeze moves primarily by leaping around the target, sometimes jumping quite long distances.
- An aggressive adversary, the breeze shoots volatile wind energy in the form of wind charge projectiles at its target.
- Wind charges deal a small amount of damage when colliding directly with an entity.
- After colliding with an entity or a block, wind charge projectiles produce a wind burst, which knocks back entities in the area by several blocks.
- Wind bursts also have the effect of 'activating' certain blocks:
	- Non-iron doors and trapdoors are flipped.
	- Fence gates are flipped.
	- Buttons are pressed.
	- Levers are flipped.
	- Bells are rung and swung.
	- Lit candles (both standalone and on cake) are extinguished.
- Wind bursts do not have any effect on iron doors, iron trapdoors, or any block being held in its position by a redstone signal.
- Currently does not drop any loot.

#### Non-mob entities
** Wind Charge **
- Fired by thebreeze.
- Explodes upon impact, emitting a large burst of plumeparticlesandknockingentities back similar to a TNT explosion.
- Its explosion interacts with certain blocks, includingbuttonsandtrapdoors.
- Deals damage when colliding directly with a player or mob.
- Wind charges breakdecorated potandchorus flowersupon collision.
- Can be deflected, just like shulker bullets.

#### World generation
** Trial Chambers **
- Trial chambers are a new structure in the Overworld where players can explore and take on combat challenges during the mid-game.
	- Trial chambers are made out of a variety of copper and tuff blocks and can be found in different sizes from large to small.
	- Trial chambers are a relatively common find throughout the deepslate layer of the underground, with the starting piece generating at a height between-40and-20.
- The layout of each trial chamber is procedurally generated, and can include traps, supply and reward chests, decorated pots, and a variety of combat spaces.
	- Traps include dispensers containing different potential items, such asarrowsorfire charges.
	- Supply chests can be found between the different rooms, and give the player blocks and items which help them navigate their trials.
	- Reward chests are guarded by challenges in each room, and can be a source of many high level enchanted books and equipment.
	- Decorated pots found in hallways can contain supplies such as iron or arrows. Some pots are decorated and others are blank.
	- The loot found in reward chests and decorated pots are still being iterated, and are absolutely not final as well as the loot from defeating mobs from a trial spawner.
- Each trial chamber will include trial spawners with a melee, small melee, or ranged category:
	- Melee
		- Zombie
		- Husk
		- Slime
	- Small Melee
		- Spider
		- Cave Spider
		- Baby Zombie
		- Silverfish
	- Ranged
		- Skeleton
		- Stray
		- Skeleton with Poison Tipped Arrows
- Each trial spawner category will only use one mob for the entire structure when generated, and these mobs are randomized for each trial chamber.
	- For example, one trial chamber might only spawn zombies, cave spiders and strays, while another might only spawn slimes, silverfish and skeletons.
	- The exceptions to this are some trial spawners in unique rooms which always spawn breezes.
- Regular mob spawning does not happen inside the bounding boxes of the trial chamber pieces.
