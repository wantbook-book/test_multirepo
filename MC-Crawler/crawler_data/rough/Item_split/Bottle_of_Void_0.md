# Bottle of Entity
Bottles of entity are joke drinks, introduced in 23w13a_or_b, that transform players into the respective mobs when drunk.

Splash bottles of entity are variations of bottles of entity that can be thrown.

A bottle of void is a special bottle that transforms a player back into their original form. Using one on a transformed player (or drinking it) removes the transformation and convert the bottle into a bottle of entity of that transformation, or a bottle of the players active effects if they were not transformed.

A transformation into an entity sometimes leads to special effects. For example, transforming into a chicken allows the player to glide slowly to the ground. The chicken, however, takes fall damage upon landing, killing it and transforming the player back to themselves.

Transforming into an enderman causes the player to be teleported randomly when a projectile is aimed at it or when they're being looked at by other players. Transforming into any mob capable of flight (for example, a bat) allows the player to fly in survival mode as if they were in creative mode. The Bottle of Entity is heavily based off of the famous Morph Mod.

## Obtaining
Bottle of void is obtained by drinking a glass bottle. Rule "drink_air" must be approved to enable that. Then, by using the bottle of void on a mob, a bottle of that mob is obtained. This can be turned into a splash bottle of that mob in a brewing stand with gunpowder, just like any other potion.
