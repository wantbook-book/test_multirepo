# MinecraftEdu
MinecraftEdu is a fork of Java Edition developed by TeacherGaming, published by E-Line Media and licensed by Mojang Studios.[2] It was meant as an educational version of Minecraft.

In the beginning, MinecraftEdu was developed by TeacherGaming, consisting of three developers and three teachers, located in the United States and Finland. Later, TeacherGaming expanded into a team of eight.

MinecraftEdu focuses on allowing the player to explore, interact with, and modify a dynamically-generated map made of one-cubic-meter-sized blocks. In doing so the student with the help of the teacher is supposed to learn a variety of subjects. The teacher can change settings to define where students can place and destroy blocks and the world used on the server.

On January 19, 2016, Mojang announced that they would be acquiring MinecraftEdu from TeacherGaming. At the same time, a new educational version of the game was announced: Minecraft: Education Edition (later renamed to Minecraft Education) has since launched to schools around the world.[3]
