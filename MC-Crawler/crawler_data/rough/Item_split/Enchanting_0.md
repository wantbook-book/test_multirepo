# Enchanting
Enchanting is a mechanic that augments armor, tools, weapons, and books with a variety of enchantments that improve an item's existing abilities or imbue them with additional abilities and uses. A 'purple glint' animation appears on items to show that they are enchanted.

## Enchanting methods
An enchanting table surrounded by bookshelves.
There are four ways to enchant an item in Survival mode:

- Through an enchanting table in exchange forexperiencepoints and lapis lazuli. Only unenchanted items may be enchanted this way.
- Through ananvil, combining anenchanted bookwith an item.
- Through an anvil, combining two of the same item with different existing enchantments into a single item that has the enchantments of both.
- Through alibrarian villager, which may enchant books respectively for emeralds instead of lapis lazuli and experience, which instead gives the player experience just like everytrade.

A player may also obtain items already enchanted:

- Through a villager, who may trade some enchanted items foremeralds.
- Byfishing, which gives a chance of obtaining enchanted items.
- Through azombie,drowned,husk,piglin,skeleton,bogged,stray,wither skeleton, andzombified piglinif they have enchanted items and are killed by aplayer. They have an 8.5% chance to drop each individual item.
- By finding them in treasure chests in locations such asend cities,ancient cities,shipwrecks,mineshafts,dungeons,desert temples,jungle temples,woodland mansions,ocean ruins,strongholds,ruined portals,pillager outposts, andbastion remnants.
- Due tobarteringwith piglins. When given gold, piglins have a small chance to drop an enchantedbookoriron bootswith theSoul Speedenchantment (random level 1-3).
- Through killingpillagersandvindicatorsinraidsonBedrock Edition.

Server operators and players in singleplayer worlds with cheats enabled can also enchant items using commands such as /enchant. When enchanted with the /give command, the maximum enchantment level is 255 on Java Edition. In Creative mode, items can be enchanted via an anvil and enchanted books, with no experience points required. Enchanted books are available in the Creative mode inventory, with individual book displays for the highest level of each enchantment and other levels available via the "Search" tab.

### Enchanting table
Main article: Enchanting mechanics
Enchanting table interface.
An item can be enchanted by using an enchanting table and placing the item in the input slots and 1–3 lapis lazuli in its dedicated slot. Upon placing the item, three (pseudo)randomized options appear on the right of the GUI. The glyphs here do not affect the enchantment, but hovering over a presented enchantment shows one enchantment to be applied (on mobile devices, the player can tap an enchantment before putting in the lapis lazuli or hold the enchantment before release). The only choices available have a level requirement equal to or below the player's current level and a lapis lazuli requirement equal to or below the number of lapis lazuli placed in the table. Each option imbues the item with a randomized set of enchantments that are dependent on the number of experience levels required (e.g. a level 10 enchantment can give a pickaxe the "Efficiency II" enchantment); the actual level cost and the number of lapis lazuli required have no effect.

Although the player must have at least the level requirement to get an enchantment, the number of levels that the player is charged is the same as the lapis lazuli requirement. For example, if the third enchantment listed is a level 30 enchantment, the player must have at least 30 levels, but pay only 3 levels and 3 lapis lazuli.

The level requirement influences the quantity, type, and level of enchantments instilled in the item, with a higher experience level generally resulting in more and/or higher-level enchantments. Nevertheless, there is a significant random factor, and even a level 30 enchantment (the maximum) doesn't guarantee more than one enchantment, or even that enchantments are "maximum strength" — a level 30 enchantment can still yield Fortune II or Efficiency III alone, for example. On the other hand, it is possible for multiple different enchantments to be given from one use of the enchanting table. For example, a level 30 enchantment applied to a pickaxe may yield both Efficiency IV and Unbreaking III. However, certain selected enchants never give any additional enchantment, regardless of which tool is enchanted, such as Efficiency IV and Knockback II. ‌[BE  only] (Needs verifying).

To increase the enchantment level, bookshelves can be placed next to the enchanting table while keeping one block of air between them. To gain access to the previously mentioned level 30 enchantments, a total of 15 bookshelves need to be placed around the enchanting table. See the Enchantment Mechanics page for more detailed information on this.

Enchanting a book produces an enchanted book, which does nothing on its own, but effectively "saves" the enchantment for later application to another item with an anvil.

Unlike with an anvil, using the enchanting table while on Creative still costs experience. However, if the player doesn't have enough experience, then experience reduces to zero and the enchantment still works, even when using the enchanting table while already at level zero.
