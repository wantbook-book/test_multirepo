A vindicator spawns with an iron axe and has an 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II, and 11.5% with Looting III) of dropping it upon death by the player. It is usually heavily damaged and is sometimes enchanted.

A piglin brute spawns with a golden axe and has an 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II, and 11.5% with Looting III) of dropping it upon death by the player. Also, in Java Edition, zombified piglins can drop their golden axe (with the same chance as piglin brute drop) if they have been zombified from a piglin brute.

#### Raids
In Bedrock Edition, Vindicator and pillagers that spawn in raids have a 4.1% chance (5.12% on hard) to drop a badly-damaged iron axe, which is sometimes enchanted with a random enchantment. A vindicator can drop 2 iron axes, one from natural equipment and one from raid drops.

## Usage
### Chopping
An axe is used to break logs, blocks derived from wood and some other blocks faster than by using other tools. An axe uses 1 durability to break 1 block. For blocks that break instantly, it uses 0 durability.

#### Durability
Each tier of axe has a different durability:

| Material  | Durability |
|-----------|------------|
| Wood      | 59         |
| Stone     | 131        |
| Iron      | 250        |
| Diamond   | 1561       |
| Golden    | 32         |
| Netherite | 2031       |

#### Speed
The following table summarizes the speed at which axes of different qualities perform.
