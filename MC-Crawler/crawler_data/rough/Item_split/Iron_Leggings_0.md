Leggings can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the leggings' maximum durability, rounded down. Two leggings of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the leggings' enchantments.

1. ↑ a b c d e fAll enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.
2. ↑ a b c dEnchantment probabilities are the same as a level-20 to level-39 enchantment would be on an enchantment table that had no cap at level 30, and that was able to apply treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and where the chance of multiple enchantments is not reduced.
3. ↑ a bThe item has between 80% and 100% of its total durability.

### Mob loot
Zombies, husks, skeletons, strays, bogged, piglins, and zombified piglins have a small chance to spawn wearing armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the leggings they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an ominous trial spawner. The dropped leggings are usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted with enchantment levels 5-19.

In Bedrock Edition, vindicators and pillagers spawning in raids have a 4.16% chance (5.128% on hard difficulty) to drop iron leggings. The dropped leggings are usually badly damaged, and have a 50% chance of being enchanted with a random enchantment.

### Trading
In Java Edition, novice-level armorer villagers have a 40% chance to sell iron leggings for 7 emeralds. Apprentice-level armorer villagers have a 50% chance to sell chainmail leggings for 3 emeralds. Expert-level armorer villagers always sell enchanted diamond leggings for 18-35 emeralds. Novice-level leatherworker villagers have a 2⁄3 chance to sell randomly dyed[note 1] leather pants for 3 emeralds.

Armorer villagers may give the players with the Hero of the Village effect chainmail leggings. ‌[Java Edition  only]

In Bedrock Edition, novice-level armorer villagers have a 25% chance of selling iron leggings for 7 emeralds. Apprentice-level armorers have a 1⁄3 chance to sell chainmail leggings for 3 emeralds. Expert-level armorers have a 50% chance to sell enchanted diamond leggings for 14 emeralds. Novice-level leatherworker villagers have 50% chance to sell leather pants for 3 emeralds.


↑ The leather armor has a random color created by two dyes (possibly the same dye twice).
