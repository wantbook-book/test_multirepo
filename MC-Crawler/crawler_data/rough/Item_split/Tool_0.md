# Tool
A tool is an item used by the player while held to perform actions faster and more efficiently, to gather materials not obtainable by hand, or to perform completely new actions. In Java Edition, one of the tabs in Creative inventory is called "Tools & Utilities": items from this tab with durability are considered tools, and other items are considered utilities. Tools don't stack in the inventory and can be repaired; see Item repair.
