# Ambience
Ambience (also called ambience sounds or ambient sounds) are sounds that can be heard in specific conditions. They were created by C418 and Samuel Åberg. Currently, there are 167 different ambience sounds.

Ambience is divided into groups of ambience sounds that play under same condition/s. Currently, there are "cave", "underwater" and "Nether" ambiences.

The volume of ambient sounds can be changed through the sound settings by changing the "Ambient/Environment" slider. However, this also affects some other sounds, such as those made by firework rockets.

All ambience can be played using the /playsound minecraft:<code name> command. All ambiences' code names start with ambient.<unique code name>.

Note that the player needs to put into the command more variables than just the name of the sounds. See playsound for more info.

## Cave ambience
Cave ambience (also known as cave sounds, or eerie noises according to the subtitles) are sounds that occasionally play when the player is underground or in a dark area, based on the mood algorithm.

Cave ambience sounds can play in all biomes except the Nether biomes, as long as there is a cave or a dark enough area present.

The code name for cave ambience is ambient.cave. There are 19 different cave ambience sounds in total.

## Underwater ambience

  

This feature is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


Not to be confused with the sound produced by flowing water.
Underwater ambience plays while the player's head is underwater. There are 22 different underwater ambience sounds in total.

They can be heard within a body of water of any size and in any dimension.

Underwater ambience is divided into two groups: "Loop"  and "Loop Additions". Both of these play independently of each other while player is underwater. Additionally, "Loop Additions" are divided into 3 more groups. 

Its code name is ambient.underwater.<group code name>

Note that Rare Loop Addition's and Ultra Rare Loop Addition's rarity is exaggerated in their name. Their names are derived from their in-game code names.
