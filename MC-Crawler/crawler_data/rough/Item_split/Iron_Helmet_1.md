### Defense points
Defense points are each signified by half of a shirt of mail in the armor bar above the health bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.

Iron helmets add 2 () defense points.

### Durability
Iron Helmets can absorb 165 damage before being destroyed.

Any "hit" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken that armor doesn't protect (such as falling or drowning) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits helmets can endure.

#### Repair
Iron helmets may be repaired by using them along with some iron ingots in an anvil. Chainmail helmets may be repaired in this way with iron ingots. They may also be repaired by crafting them together with another iron helmet.

### Enchantments
A helmet can receive the following enchantments. Note that while iron and chainmail have the same durability, chainmail has a higher enchantability than iron or diamond.

### Armor trimming
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, an iron helmet, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, or diamond).


These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.
