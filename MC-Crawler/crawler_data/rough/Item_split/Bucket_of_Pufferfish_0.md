## Obtaining
A bucket of pufferfish can be obtained by using a water bucket on a pufferfish. Once a water bucket is used, the pufferfish is picked up along with the water source block.

### Trading
Wandering traders have 1⁄6 chance to sell a bucket of pufferfish for 5 emeralds.

## Usage
Pressing use with a bucket of pufferfish places a water source block, and spawns the pufferfish back into the world, leaving an empty bucket in the player's inventory. Placing a bucket of pufferfish in the Nether causes the same particles to appear that generate when a normal water bucket is placed in the Nether, and the pufferfish is spawned alone.

Pufferfish caught in buckets then released do not despawn, unlike mobs that spawn naturally in their aquatic environments.

If a bucket of pufferfish is inside a dispenser, the dispenser spawns the pufferfish and water block in front of it upon activation, leaving an empty bucket inside. Dispensers cannot pick up pufferfish with water buckets (the bucket is emptied).

If a bucket of pufferfish is named a certain name through an anvil, the pufferfish inside displays that name as if it were named with a name tag.‌[Java Edition  only] Alternatively, if a named pufferfish is captured with a bucket of water, the resulting bucket of pufferfish shares a name with the captured pufferfish.‌[Java Edition  only] If a named pufferfish is captured in Bedrock Edition, the item is called "Bucket of <Name>".
