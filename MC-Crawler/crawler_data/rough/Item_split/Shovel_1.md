Novice-level toolsmith villagers have a 25% chance to sell stone shovels for one emerald, journeyman-level toolsmith villagers have a 25% chance to sell enchanted iron shovels for 2 emeralds, and expert-level toolsmith villagers have a 50% chance to sell enchanted diamond shovels for 5 emeralds as part of their trades.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

### Villager gifts
in Java Edition, toolsmith villagers occasionally throw stone shovels at players with the Hero of the Village effect.

## Usage
### Digging
A shovel can be used to break soil-type materials faster. Breaking a block with a shovel consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that break instantly, like torches and flowers. Shovels have different amounts of uses based on the type:

- Wooden: 59 inJava Edition, 60 in inBedrock Edition;
- Stone: 131 inJava Edition, 132 in inBedrock Edition;
- Iron: 250 inJava Edition, 251 in inBedrock Edition;
- Golden: 32 inJava Edition, 33 in inBedrock Edition;
- Diamond: 1,561 inJava Edition, 1,562 in inBedrock Edition;
- Netherite: 2,031 inJava Edition, 2,032 in inBedrock Edition.

#### Speed
The following table summarizes the speed at which different quality shovels perform on different block types. Values with a red background indicate that no resource is dropped when the block is destroyed without a shovel.

### Dirt paths
A shovel can be used to create a dirt path by using (not digging) the shovel on any one of the following blocks, losing one durability point:

- Grass Block
- Dirt
- Coarse Dirt
- Rooted Dirt
- Podzol
- Mycelium

### Campfire
A shovel can be used to extinguish a campfire.

### Weapon
A shovel loses 2 points of durability when used as a weapon. Shovels may be used as a weapon, although due to having identical attack speeds to axes in Java Edition, but with less damage, they are strictly inferior to axes.
