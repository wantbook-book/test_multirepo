# Armor
Armor is a category of items that provide players and certain mobs with varying levels of protection from common damage types, and appear graphically on the wearer (excluding non-humanoid wearers). These items include several different tiers of helmets, chestplates, leggings, and boots, which can each be placed in designated armor slots of a player's inventory for use.

## Obtaining
### Crafting
A full set of leather, iron, golden, or diamond armor consists of 24 units of a given material. A turtle shell is a helmet with no corresponding armor pieces. Despite there being chain items, chainmail armor cannot be crafted.

### Upgrading
Obtaining netherite armor requires combining a diamond armor piece with a netherite ingot and a netherite upgrade smithing template using a smithing table. A full suit of netherite armor needs 4 netherite upgrade smithing templates and 4 netherite ingots (16 netherite scraps and 16 gold ingots).

While upgrading, the newly crafted netherite armor retains the enchantments, prior work penalty and number of durability points lost (instead of the remaining durability) from the diamond armor.

### Natural generation
Two armor stands are found in each taiga village outdoor armory, one equipped with an iron helmet, the other with an iron chestplate.

### Chest loot
In Bedrock Edition, a sealed room in woodland mansions can appear that has a chest always containing an armor piece enchanted with Efficiency I.[1] The piece is either leather boots if the "Update 1.21" experimental toggle is disabled,‌[until BE 1.21.0] a chainmail chestplate if the toggle is enabled,‌[until BE 1.21.0] or chainmail leggings ‌in Bedrock Edition 1.21.0‌[upcoming].
