## Spawning

  

This article is missing information about Mangrove swamps. 
Please expand the article to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page.


In Java Edition, random varieties of tropical fish spawn in groups of 8 in lukewarm or warm oceans (as well as their deep variants) at Y-level 50 to 63, and in lush caves at any Y-level. They can also spawn in mangrove swamps in groups of 8. They are subject to fish spawning requirements.

In Bedrock Edition, tropical fish spawn underwater at 12-32 blocks away from the player. Tropical fish spawn only in warm, lukewarm, deep lukewarm ocean biomes and lush caves, in groups of 3-5 for the same preset pattern, and in groups of 1-3 for a random pattern. In addition, tropical fish in warm, lukewarm ocean and deep variants can spawn only at Y levels between 50 and 64 and must be on the surface (i.e., there must not be a spawnable block above the spawn location with a non-solid block on top). Tropical fish in lush caves can spawn on any Y levels but require underground.

## Behavior
Tropical fish tend to swim in schools of fish (a maximum of nine tropical fish per school). Tropical fish are also able to go against the water flow.

The player may collect a fish by using a water bucket on it, which gives the player a bucket of tropical fish. Fish placed with buckets do not despawn naturally. When that fish bucket is used against a block, it empties the bucket, placing water with that fish swimming in it.

### Weaknesses
Tropical fish cannot survive out of water. Outside of water, they flop around for a while until eventually they suffocate and die. In Bedrock Edition, they rotate when flipping. Fish cannot swim or breathe in cauldron water.[2]

Fish have a weakness to weapons that have the Impaling enchantment, which also affects squid, turtles, guardians, elder guardians and dolphins.‌[Java Edition  only]

## Varieties
The 22 uniquely-named varieties of tropical fish in Java Edition. From top to bottom and left to right: Anemone, Black Tang, Blue Tang, Butterflyfish, Cichlid, Clownfish Cotton Candy Betta, Dottyback, Emperor Red Snapper, Goatfish, Moorish Idol, Ornate Butterflyfish Parrotfish, Queen Angelfish, Red Cichlid, Red Lipped Blenny, Red Snapper, Threadfin Tomato Clownfish, Triggerfish, Yellowtail Parrotfish, Yellow Tang
All possible tropical fish variants.
### Java Edition
When tropical fish spawn in the wild, 90% of the time they appear as schools of one of the 22 varieties seen on the right, and the other 10% of the time their patterns, size, and colors are completely random, drawn from any of 2 shapes, 6 patterns, 16 base colors, and 16 pattern colors. The color black is not supposed to appear on any naturally-spawned tropical fish, since the eyes are usually hard to see[3], but due to a bug[1] black can be chosen randomly. This results in 3,072 naturally-occurring combinations, instead of the intended 2,700.

Tropical fish can be summoned with black as one or both of their colors, and/or without any visible pattern,[more information needed] though even without the pattern they can still have a pattern color, causing a further 884 possible combinations, 480 of which look the same due to the missing pattern.
