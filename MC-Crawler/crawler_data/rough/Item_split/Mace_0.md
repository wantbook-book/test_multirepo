# Mace
A mace is a melee weapon that deals more damage the farther a player falls before hitting an entity with it, with successful hits completely negating the user's fall damage. It requires a heavy core to craft, only obtainable from ominous vaults, and a breeze rod dropped from breezes.

A mace can be repaired in an anvil by adding breeze rods or another mace. One breeze rod restores 25% of the mace's durability.[verify]

## Usage
### Attacking
Pressing attack while holding a mace inflicts damage on both mobs and other players. Upon damaging a mob or player, the mace's durability decreases by 1.

If the player hits an entity while falling, a smash attack is performed. Note that "entity" is not restricted to mobs only. Armour stands also count as entities that a smash attack can be performed on. The smash attack is activated when the player falls more than 1.5 blocks. Upon a smash attack being performed, extra damage is dealt to the mob hit based on the distance fallen, and entities within 2.5 blocks of the player are knocked back.

When a smash attack is performed, the damage is increased by 3 plus the level of Density per block of falling distance before critical damage calculation. Smash attacks are almost always critical hits, as long as the mace has full attack cooldown, doing 50% extra damage. The amount of damage a mace can accumulate from falling is unlimited,[1] allowing a single hit from a mace to kill a player wearing full Protection IV netherite armor after falling 17 blocks, and a warden after falling 109 blocks. The damage increase from falling distance is not applied while in elytra flight.[2]

After successfully attacking a target with the mace, the player's fall damage is reset. From the height the player hit the mob, the player begins accumulating fall damage again.

Attacking a boat or a minecart with a mace instantly destroys it without decreasing the mace's durability.‌[Java Edition  only]
