### Stripping
Using an axe on a log, wood block, block of bamboo, or block of copper causes it to become a stripped log, stripped wood block, block of stripped bamboo, or removes one layer of oxidization or wax, respectively. This consumes one point of durability from the axe.

### Weapon
An axe loses 2 points of durability when used as a weapon. Attacking a shielding player with an axe disables the use of all of their shields for 5 seconds. Vindicators, piglin brutes, and other axe-wielding mob can also disable a shielding player's shield.

#### Java Edition
Damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a sword of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to recover, resulting in lower DPS (with the exception of golden axes). The damage dealt and cooldown time depends on the type:

| Material  | Attack Damage | Attack Speed | Recovery time                 | DPS  | Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1] |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------------------------|------|-----------------------------------|
| Wooden    | 7             | 0.8          | 1.25 seconds (25game ticks)   | 5.6  | 210× 105                          |
| Gold      | 7             | 1.0          | 1 second (20game ticks)       | 7.0  | 112× 56                           |
| Stone     | 9             | 0.8          | 1.25 seconds (25game ticks)   | 7.2  | 594× 297                          |
| Iron      | 9             | 0.9          | 1.11 seconds (22.2game ticks) | 8.1  | 1125× 562.5                       |
| Diamond   | 9             | 1.0          | 1 second (20game ticks)       | 9.0  | 7029× 3514.5                      |
| Netherite | 10            | 1.0          | 1 second (20game ticks)       | 10.0 | 10160× 5080                       |

1. ↑The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because axes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.

#### Bedrock Edition
In Bedrock Edition, axes always attack instantly and deal 1 less damage than a sword of the same quality.

| Material  | Damage |
|-----------|--------|
| Wooden    | 4      |
| Golden    |        |
| Stone     | 5      |
| Iron      | 6      |
| Diamond   | 7      |
| Netherite | 8      |

### Enchantments
An axe can receive the following enchantments:

| Name                                              | Description                                                                                    | Max Level | Method                                           | Weight |
