### Trading
In Bedrock Edition, novice-level Butcher villagers always offer to sell rabbit stew for one emerald as their second trade.

In Java Edition, novice-level Butcher villagers have a 50% chance of offering rabbit stew for one emerald.

## Usage
### Food
To eat rabbit stew, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 10 () hunger and 12 hunger saturation. This restores more hunger than any other food type in the game except cake, but has less saturation than a golden carrot, a cooked porkchop, or a steak.

Eating rabbit stew leaves the player with an empty bowl, similar to mushroom stew, suspicious stew, and beetroot soup.

### Wolves
In Bedrock Edition, rabbit stew can be used to feed wolves, healing them by 10. However, unlike other wolf food, rabbit stew does not speed up the growth of baby wolves, and it cannot be used to breed them. It is usable only on a wolf that has less than full health.
