### Boats

  

This feature is exclusive to  Java Edition. 





This section demonstrates the use of a bug to make a contraption. 
Bugs of this nature may be fixed at any time without warning, causing the contraption to stop working. Bug exploits may be disallowed on some multiplayer servers and lead to a ban if used.Use at your own risk.


Due to the bug MC-113871, boats can be captured by minecarts. When a boat is placed in a minecart, the minecart travels faster on rails, approximately as fast as on powered rails. The movement in the boat minecart is glitchy and moving forward with the W key moves the cart backward relative to the player, and vice versa for moving backward with the S key. The minecart also moves on the rail-less ground at a crawling speed, but it does not float in the water despite being in a boat. 

Using this glitch can be far more resource-efficient since the boat minecart can move at the speed of a powered rail track on flat ground and on slopes. Another physics glitch with the boat minecart is the extreme reduction in friction when the minecart is on rails, which is similar to the lack of friction when a boat is riding on ice. This glitch can be done in Survival without cheats simply by pushing a minecart into a boat on the track. This bug is now patched.

Similar to the boat and due to a long-standing bug, a saddled pig can be captured by a minecart. Riding one allows the player to move as fast as on powered rails (including uphill), without the use of any powered rails. The movement is reversed as with the boat, such that pressing W moves the cart backward while S moves the cart forward (think like a real plane/train's thrust lever).
