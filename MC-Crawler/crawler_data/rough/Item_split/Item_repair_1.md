## Anvil repair
Main article: Anvil mechanics
An anvil can also repair items in two different ways. This costs experience levels, but unlike the grindstone, the anvil preserves or can even enhance the target's enchantments. The anvil can combine the enchantments on two similar items, or rename any item (not just the ones it can repair). The costs are complex, so a summary is given here.

The repair cost is stored in a repairCost value.

### Combination
Two items of the same type are put into the input slots; the first one is the item to be repaired and the second one is to be merged into the first. The second item's durability is added to the first, and if applicable, some or all enchantments from the second item are added.

### Unit repair
Some items can be repaired by "covering" the damage with a specific material. The item to be repaired is put into the first input slot, and the corresponding material is put into the second slot. Each material item (unit) heals the item's durability by 25% its maximum durability, rounded down.


Anything not listed below does not have a unit repair item, and can be repaired only by consuming another instance of itself.
