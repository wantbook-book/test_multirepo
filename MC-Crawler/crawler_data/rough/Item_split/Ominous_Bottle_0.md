# Ominous Bottle
An ominous bottle is an item that gives a player the Bad Omen effect for 100 minutes (1:40:00 or 120,000 game ticks) when drunk. Ominous bottles have 5 levels, which correspond with the 5 levels of Bad Omen.

## Usage
Consuming an ominous bottle gives a player the Bad Omen effect[more information needed] and destroys the bottle, rather than leaving an empty glass bottle in the player's inventory. The ominous bottle is a potion, not a food, and has no effect other than giving the player Bad Omen.

### Bad Omen
Main article: Bad Omen § Effect
The Bad Omen effect can be "used" immediately after an ominous bottle is consumed. Immediately means 1 game tick in Java Edition, and a few game ticks in Bedrock Edition (the exact number of game ticks is unknown).

Main article: Raid Omen § Effect
When a player enters a village, Bad Omen transforms into Raid Omen, which starts a raid if it is not removed in time.

Main article: Trial Omen § Effect
When a trial spawner sees a player with Bad Omen, the Bad Omen transforms into Trial Omen, which causes all nearby trial spawners to become ominous.

### Brewing
Like the honey bottle, the ominous bottle cannot be used for brewing in a brewing stand. There is no splash or lingering variant of the item.
