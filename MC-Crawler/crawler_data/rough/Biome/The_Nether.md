## Accessing
Main article: Nether portal
"Economy" portal without corners (left), full portal (right)
To access the Nether, the player must construct a nether portal in the Overworld (portals created in the End do not activate). To create the portal, the player must first build a rectangular obsidian frame, ranging in size from a minimum of 4 blocks × 5 blocks to a maximum of 23 blocks × 23 blocks. Once the frame is completed, it can then be activated by placing fire within the frame, using flint and steel, fire charge, dispensers or any material that is capable of igniting fire.

The portal allows most entities (with the exception of the wither, the ender dragon, and entities riding or being ridden by another entity) to be transported to a corresponding portal in the Nether. In Survival, the player must stand in a nether portal for 4 seconds to get to the Nether. The player can step out of a portal before it completes its animation to abort the teleport. The portal plays a sound effect while the player is inside it. If there is no corresponding portal, a new 4×5 portal is created. The portal can be destroyed by breaking the obsidian frame, by a nearby explosion, or by placing water in the Overworld or lava into it with a bucket or dispenser. Any of the blocks in the corners can be destroyed without destroying the portal.

In the former Old‌[Bedrock Edition  only] world type, it is impossible to construct a nether portal. The portal block must be placed using cheats. When done, the Nether has the same 256×256 borders as the Overworld, and if a nether portal is then made in the Nether, it can spawn the player outside the world barrier.

If cheats are enabled, players can also teleport to the Nether without using a nether portal: the syntax is /execute in the_nether in Java Edition, and /execute in nether in Bedrock Edition.

## Traits
Bedrock comprises the top (including and below layer 127) and bottom 4 layers in a rough pattern, essentially making the Nether 128 blocks high unlike the Overworld's 384. In the infinite worlds of the Java and Bedrock Editions, the Nether is also horizontally infinite. In Bedrock Edition, the build limit in the Nether is 128 blocks, despite it being 256 in the End, and 320 in the Overworld. 

The Nether has no daylight cycle and no weather. Natural sources of light include fire, lava, portals, shroomlights and glowstone. Even with a light level of 0, the Nether has a dim ambient light (roughly equivalent to light level 8 in the Overworld). Light otherwise functions exactly the same as it does in the Overworld and the End.

The majority of flora in the Nether is fungus-based as opposed to plants. The Nether "grass" consists of specialized Nether mycelium (known as "nylium"). The Nether features its own unique fungi (including nether wart), as well as equivalent huge fungi that serve as trees. The stems of the huge fungi function as logs. Also present are a number of native vines and roots.

Most creatures found in the Nether are hostile and potentially dangerous.

Locations in the Nether correlate to Overworld coordinates, but horizontal Overworld distances are scaled down by a ratio of 8:1 for travel in the Nether. Therefore, traveling one block in the Nether means traveling eight blocks in the Overworld. For example, in a perfect scenario, a player who enters a portal in the Overworld at x=0, z=0 and travels in the Nether to x=1000, z=1000 returns to the Overworld at x=8000, z=8000. This makes portals a useful tool for traveling long distances in the Overworld.

Most items and blocks in the Nether function the same as they do in the Overworld, with a few notable exceptions: 

- Bedsexplodeand cause fires when a player attempts to sleep in one. It has an explosion power of 5. The explosion is larger than that ofTNT, which has an explosion power of 4. They cannot be used as a respawn point.
- One has to use a poweredrespawn anchorto respawn in the Nether, but when it runs out of charges, the player once again respawns in the Overworld.
- There is no way to place liquidwaterin the Nether without the use ofcommands, except inside acauldron. These can be used to put out a player on fire, but are difficult to center oneself in.
	- Usingwater bucketsproduces steam particles and a hissing sound, leaving the player with an emptybucket.
	- Icethat is melted or smashed in the Nether does not produce water.
	- Awet spongeinstantly becomes a regularspongewhen placed.
	- If somehow placed using cheats or when placed inside a cauldron, water takes on a reddish-brown color.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
- Lava flows twice as far (eight blocks) and six times as fast in the Nether compared to Overworld, basically water's equivalent flow characteristics from the Overworld.
- Grass blocksandleavestake a dead-looking brownish color because the Nether isdry and hot.
- Mapsgenerate a brown-gray static pattern. The player's direction indicator spins randomly; its location is still relative to the player's location in the Nether, except in theNew Nintendo 3DS Edition, where it is always in the center of the map. Usable significantly for lava ocean travel viastrider. Putting the map in the off-hand minimizes the map to help see one's strider footing.
- Clocksspin wildly, making it impossible to tell the time while in the Nether.Compassesalso spin wildly unless connected to alodestone, which they then point toward.
- Snow golemsrapidly take fire damage and die, due to the Nether being dry and hot. However, they can survive if they have theFire Resistancestatus effect.‌[Java Edition  only]
- Stalactitesproduce lava particles instead of water particles, and do not convertmudabove them intoclay.[1]

## Environment
The Nether features unique cave-like terrain with no sky. Lava and fire are common hazards everywhere in the Nether. Areas distant from the player are shrouded in fog of red or blue. The shape of the terrain in the Nether is independent of the biome distribution; instead, the biome alters the surface material and adds terrain features to the netherrack terrain. 

### Biomes
Main article: Biome § The Nether
The Nether is divided into several biomes just like the Overworld, each featuring unique terrain, mobs, structures, ambience, etc. There are currently five biomes in the Nether.

| Biome name       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Image |

| Nether Wastes    | Initially the sole biome in the dimension before theNether Update, the nether wastes is the most common biome in the Nether. The surface is composed of uncoverednetherrack, exposing moreblobsthan any other biome.Zombified piglinsdominate this biome, and can be found in hordes of up to 4. Ghasts and Magma cubes also spawn, along with the occasional group ofPiglins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |       |
| Crimson Forest   | The biome is named for its red color, and is covered by the canopies ofhuge, tree-like fungi. Huge, pig-like animals calledhoglinsroam around thenylium-covered terrain, while tribes ofpiglinshunt them for food. This makes it one of the only biomes to have an ecosystem. While not as numerous as in thenether wastes, the occasionalzombified piglinalso roams, and if near normal piglins, it scares them away.It is also one of the more habitable biomes in the Nether, due to hoglins being a source of food in the dimension, and despite being a hostile mob, it can be bred, making it perfect for farms in the dimension.                                                                                                        |       |
| Warped Forest    | This forest-type biome has the most amount offlorain the Nether dimension (due to the additionalnether sproutsthat are found only within the biome) but also has only twomobs, those being theendermenand the occasionalstrider. The amount of endermen here makes the biome an ideal place to collectender pearlsbefore the player has access tothe Enddimension.The low diversity of mobs here makes it another habitable place in the Nether, since no mobs spawned here are naturally hostile to the player.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |       |
| Soul Sand Valley | Thisdesert-like biome is dangerous, not just because of the huge caverns and darkness that can allow numbers ofghastsandskeletonsto spawn, but also due to the deposits ofsoul sand, which slows down theplayer.Bootsenchanted withSoul Speedallow the player to avoid the slowing effect of soul sand. Bluish-coloredsoul fireis common here and are more dangerous than regular fires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |       |
| Basalt Deltas    | With high amounts oflavaandmagma cubes, this is one of the most dangerous biomes in the game. The terrain consists of steep and spikybasaltformations along with the flatterdeltas. When the biome collides with alava sea, archipelagos of basalt andgravelform. The biome is almost impossible to build in, which might explain whybastion remnantsdon’t generate here (unless abastion remnantgenerates in a bordering biome).Even though the magma cubes here are dangerous, their spawning rate makes the biome ideal for collecting magma cream, which can be used for brewing Fire Resistance potions. Blackstone also generates more commonly here than in other Nether biomes, making the basalt deltas ideal for making stone tools. |       |

### Generated structures
Main article: Structure § The Nether
The Nether contains a variety of unique generated structures. Though equally vast, it contains far fewer types of generated structures than the Overworld.

| Name            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Image |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Nether fortress | Nether fortresses are large, castle-like structures that are composed ofnether bricks. This structure is often found bridging overlava seas, or tunnelling throughnetherrack.This structure is the only place blazes and wither skeletons spawn, making fortresses the gateway to both bosses in the game: the ender dragon and the wither. Fortresses also contain blaze monster spawners, as well as small nether wart farms where nether wart can be obtained. Nether fortresses can be found in all Nether biomes. |       |
| Nether fossil   | Nether fossils are structures comprised ofbone blocks. These structures have 14 different designs. Unlikefossilsin theOverworld,coal oredoes not generate within these fossils. This structure generates exclusively withinsoul sand valleybiomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       |
| Bastion remnant | Bastion remnants are large fortifications made up ofblackstone,blackstone bricksandbasalt. A large amount ofgold blocksandloot chestscan be found within these structures. They generate in four distinct variants, each with its own unique structure and loot. These structures are inhabited by thepiglinsandpiglin brutes, and in certain variantshoglinsas well. These structures generate within any Nether biome except for thebasalt deltas.                                                                   |       |
| Ruined portal   | A structure containing what appears to be a destroyednether portaland various types ofstoneorblackstonematerials, when generating in the Overworld or the Nether, respectively. Netherrack generates on the ground around the portal, and achestcontaining loot generates with the structure.These structures can be found in any Overworld and Nether biome.                                                                                                                                                          |       |

### Terrain features
The Nether has a lot of different terrain features that generate within the biomes of the Nether. 

| Name           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                | Image |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Lava sea       | Lava seas generate at and belowlevel 31in all Nether biomes.Striders can be found striding across these seas.                                                                                              |       |
| Glowstone blob | Glowstone blobs generate on the ceiling of the Nether in all biomes.                                                                                                                                       |       |
| Basalt pillar  | Basalt pillars generate insoul sand valleybiomes and on thelava seaspresent there.                                                                                                                         |       |
| Delta          | Deltas are sheets of constrainedlavaandmagma blocksfound among the terrain ofbasalt deltasbiomes.                                                                                                          |       |
| Hidden lava    | Single blocks oflavaare buried withinnetherrackin all Nether biomes. These are particularly dangerous when mining in the Nether, as the lava can quickly flow out and overwhelm the player when uncovered. |       |

### Mobs
The Nether is home to its own share of mobs, most of which are fire- and lava-proof. Skeletons, chickens, and endermen are the only Overworld mobs that can naturally spawn in the Nether; in Java Edition, baby zombified piglins may spawn as chicken jockeys and regular zombies spawn when a zombified piglin calls reinforcements.[2]

Other Overworld mobs do not naturally spawn in the Nether but can be teleported through portals (with the exception of withers and ender dragons).

### Folder
In Java Edition, the Nether is stored in .minecraft/saves/worldname/DIM-1. Deleting this folder resets the Nether, so that all player-made changes and buildings in that dimension are undone.

In Bedrock Edition, the com.mojang/minecraftWorlds/world ID/db folder contains several collections of chunks. Some of these files are used for the Nether, but it is impossible to tell which ones simply by reading the file name.
