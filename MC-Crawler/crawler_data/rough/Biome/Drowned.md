# Drowned
Drowned are neutral mobs and common underwater zombie variants that spawn in oceans, rivers and dripstone caves, or when zombies drown. They usually attack through melee attacks, but may also come armed with tridents that they throw. They are the only renewable source of copper.

## Spawning
### Natural generation
Drowned spawn naturally at light level of 0 in all ocean biomes, aquifers in the dripstone caves biome, and river biomes. They spawn at higher rates in rivers and dripstone caves than in ocean biomes.

In Java Edition, drowned spawn individually inside flowing water or source water that is 2 blocks or taller (this can include waterlogged blocks). In ocean biomes, drowned spawn at Y < 58, or at least 6 blocks below sea level; this restriction does not apply to rivers. 

In Bedrock Edition, drowned spawn in groups of 2–4 inside flowing water or source water of any depth, but they spawn at higher rates in water that is 2 blocks or taller.[more information needed] They spawn only on the surface that is on the highest spawnable block at any given X, Z coordinate. They count toward the monster population control cap and also have their own density caps of 5 in oceans and 2 in rivers. 

Drowned have a chance to spawn with either a trident or a fishing rod, and occasionally with a nautilus shell. in Java Edition, they also have a small chance of spawning while riding a chicken, creating a drowned chicken jockey. They are the only zombie variant within the game that cannot spawn naturally with any armor. The only way drowned can spawn with armor is if they used to be a zombie with armor. Their eyes give off a glow effect, but not any light levels.

### Ocean ruins
Drowned spawn during the generation of certain ocean ruin structures. These drowned do not naturally despawn unless the world is set to Peaceful difficulty.

### Conversion
A zombie converting into a drowned.
If a zombie's head (not the legs) is submerged in water continuously for 30 seconds, it begins the process of converting to a drowned. It starts shaking, similar to the effect seen while a zombie villager is being cured. At this point, the process cannot be stopped, and 15 seconds later the zombie becomes drowned. The drowned appears with full health even if the previous zombie did not.

In Bedrock Edition only, an item being held or worn by a zombie when it becomes drowned, whether it was picked up or naturally spawned, has a 100% drop rate, which includes any naturally spawned equipment dropping with full durability.

Only normal zombies can transform, while zombie villagers and zombified piglin can not. For husks, they first transform into a regular zombie, and subsequently convert to a drowned in the usual fashion. The zombie that converted from a husk also always has full health even if converted from a damaged husk.

## Drops
### On death

1. ↑Dropped only when kill credit is given to the player

Adult drowned drop 5 and an additional 1–3 per naturally-spawned equipment if killed by a player, axolotl or tamed wolf. Baby drowned drop 12 and an additional 1–3 per naturally-spawned equipment if killed by a player, axolotl or tamed wolf.

- 1Helmet,Chestplate,Leggings, and/orBoots.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping, and drops without changing the damage that has accumulated on it.

If a drowned is able to pick up equipment and is wielding a trident, it can trade its trident for a nautilus shell if it is not currently attacking anything.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

### Equipment
** Java Edition **
For naturally-spawned drowned:

- In the main hand:
	- Each drowned has a 6.25% chance to spawn with atrident. May be enchanted.[more information needed]
	- Each drowned has a 3.75% chance to spawn with afishing rod. May be enchanted.[more information needed]
- In the offhand:
	- Each drowned has a 3% chance to spawn with anautilus shell.

A drowned holding a trident has an 8.5% chance to drop it when killed by a player or tamed wolf. The chance is increased by 1% per level of Looting, up to a max of 11.5% with Looting III. This means the overall chance of obtaining a trident (per drowned spawn) is 0.53125% without Looting (about 1 in 188), or 0.71875% with Looting III (about 1 in 139).

A drowned holding a nautilus shell always drops it.

Zombies converted to drowned are never equipped with any items.[more information needed]

On Halloween, a drowned may spawn wearing a carved pumpkin or jack o'lantern. However, they do not drop this, even when killed with Looting.

** Bedrock Edition **
For naturally-spawned drowned:

- Main hand (mutually exclusive):
	- Each drowned has a 15% chance to spawn with atrident. May be enchanted.[more information needed]
	- Each drowned has a 0.85% chance to spawn with afishing rod. May be enchanted.[more information needed]
- In the offhand:
	- Each drowned has a 8% chance to spawn with anautilus shell.

A drowned holding a trident has a 25% chance to drop it when killed by a player or tamed wolf. This chance is increased by 4% per level of Looting, up to a max of 37% with Looting III. This means the overall chance of obtaining a trident (per drowned) is 3.75% without Looting (1 in 27), or 5.55% with Looting III (1 in 18).

For converted drowned:

- 1% spawn with afishing rodin the main hand.
- 8% spawn with anautilus shellin the offhand (same as naturally spawned drowned).

Zombies converted to drowned are never equipped with tridents.[more information needed]

## Farming
Main article: Tutorials/Drowned farming
Farms that convert zombies into drowned produce all of naturally-spawned equipment dropped by zombies, as well as fishing rods, copper ingots, and (in Bedrock Edition) nautilus shells. A drowned farm must be designed to harvest naturally-spawned drowned to produce tridents in all game editions and nautilus shells in Java Edition.

## Behavior
A drowned swimming in Java Edition.
During the day, drowned stay on the floor of the body of water they are in, unless provoked.

If on land, drowned seek out nearby water. They sometimes step onto land but quickly return to the water.

They are always hostile toward axolotls. Like other zombie variants, they chase and attack villagers, wandering traders, snow golems,‌[BE  only] baby turtles and iron golems, but only at night or in dark areas.

Drowned are passive‌[JE  only] or neutral‌[BE  only] during the day if no player in range is touching the water. Drowned ignore players on land, players in boats, and players that have attacked them or other drowned. In Java Edition, a drowned is also neutral if it is equipped with a trident during the daytime, only attacking the player if provoked. During the night or in thunderstorms, they become hostile and attack any player or baby turtle they see, without provocation.

A drowned equipped with a trident continues throwing it at the player even after the player leaves the water, or gets a long distance away.[1] It also attacks any player that attacks it or another drowned. However, it is not provoked by a player killing another drowned in one hit.‌[JE  only][2] Sometimes,[more information needed] drowned do not immediately become aggressive toward a player when the player first enters the water.

** Damage from conduits **
Drowned can be damaged by a fully-powered conduit within a distance of 8 blocks.

** Abilities **
If a drowned kills a villager, either with a melee attack or with a trident, the villager has a chance of turning into a zombie villager (a 0% chance on Easy, a 50% chance on Normal, and a 100% chance on Hard).

They are immune to guardians or elder guardians attacks. They also have a small chance to be immune to knockback when damaged.[3]

Some drowned spawn with the ability to pick up loot that is on the ground. That includes armor and weapons or tools just like regular zombies. Unlike zombies however, they can also pick up tridents, which they always prefer over anything else. They also can pick it up and throw it the wrong way.

** Using tridents **
Every drowned has a melee attack, and if it spawns with a trident, the trident is used as a ranged weapon. A drowned with a trident can throw it every 1.5 seconds, sending it up to 20 blocks away. Thrown tridents cannot be picked up by the player, just like arrows shot by skeletons. In Bedrock Edition, a drowned with a trident uses a melee attack if the target is within a 3 blocks distance.

If one drowned gets attacked by another drowned's trident, the attacked drowned ignores it.

** Agression **
Drowned seek out turtle eggs within 10 blocks in Bedrock Edition and 24 blocks in Java Edition. They stomp on turtle eggs until the eggs break. Drowned can even jump over a 1-block gap to reach a turtle egg successfully, even if the egg is raised 1 block higher than the gap. 

Drowned break down wooden doors in Hard difficulty.‌[BE  only]

** Undead **
Being an undead mob, they are: 

- Damaged by the status effectInstant Healthand healed by the status effectInstant Damage.
- Unaffected by the status effectsRegenerationandPoison.
- Ignored by thewither.
- Affected by theSmiteenchantment.
- Threatening toarmadillos, causing them to hide in their shell.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80]

### Swimming
A drowned swimming in Bedrock Edition.

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition. 


Drowned use a swimming animation similar to the player. They use this animation whenever they try to pathfind to a player that is either below or above them; if the player is on the same ground level, the drowned simply walk toward them. Drowned also use this animation if they are tracking a player while they are not standing on a solid block. Their hitbox does not change when using this animation. Also, if they hold a nautilus shell or anything else in their offhand, their arms are in the same posture as a player's. When attacking, they use the player's attacking animation. Still, they use the same swimming animation when tracking a player underwater.
