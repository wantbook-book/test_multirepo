## Generation
Desert wells generate in desert biomes. They have a 1⁄1000‌[JE  only] or 1⁄500‌[BE  only] chance to be generated in the given chunk. It is possible for a well to generate around a cactus. The well is considered a feature rather than a structure, and therefore it generates with the "Generate Structures" option disabled.[1]

## Construction
Main article: Desert Well/Structure
Desert wells are built of sandstone blocks and slabs with a water source inside. Underneath the water source are two suspicious sand blocks that can be brushed to get various items. The first suspicious sand generates directly below the water source blocks, and the second generates below that layer.

## Loot
In Java Edition and Bedrock Edition, each desert well's suspicious sand contains 1 item stack,  with the following distribution:
