# Oak
An oak is the most common tree in the game, found in a variety of biomes and available in several variants. It has the smallest initial space requirement for growth, and along with dark oaks, its leaves have a chance to drop an apple. As with birches and cherries, an oak grown near flowers can generate with a bee nest attached.

## Appearance
Oaks come in several variants with different properties:

- Small regular oaks are the most common. The leaves are arranged the same as thebirch leaf arrangement.
- Fancy oaks are less common and have a distinct look and different growth requirements. They often have branches, outgrowths of logs on the sides of the trunk, or even freestanding logs surrounded by leaves. The sapling requires 4–14 blocks of open space directly above to grow (air or leaves only) but can otherwise be completely enclosed on all sides.
	- A fancy oak form exists with a single leaf block layer above the minimal 4-block trunk, rarely allowing a tree to grow in a vertical space with a height of only 5, but otherwise, the maximum trunk height is 2 less than the vertical space, making the practical minimum height 6. Branches and outgrowths, however, require 8 blocks of open space directly above the sapling.
	- An oak can be forced into a fancy configuration if a "brace" of non-solid blocks (e.g. glass or slabs) is placed around where the trunk would be, one block off the ground.
	- A rare variant is colloquially known as a "balloon" oak. This is a fancy oak generated with the smallest size possible. It consists of a tall trunk and leaves that form a spherical shape, similar to a balloon. These oaks can grow around an obstructing block. They usually contain 4 blocks of logs, but some may contain more.
- In swamp biomes, naturally occurring swamp oaks tend to grow in the water. Unlike trees in other biomes, which typically have a slightly conical or pointed canopy, all swamp oaks have round, flat-topped canopies. Also unlike oaks, these have a broad range of foliage. They tend to be covered invinesthat trail down to the ground.Meeting point 3 in plains village.
- An oak with a unique arrangement of leaves is generated atmeeting point 3in plainsvillages. This leaf arrangement is not found elsewhere naturally, and it cannot be grown from a sapling.


## Generation
The oak variants spawn naturally in the indicated biomes:

| Biome            | Oak | Fancy Oak | Swamp Oak |
|------------------|-----|-----------|-----------|
| Bamboo Jungle    |     |           |           |
| Dark Forest      |     |           |           |

## Blocks and items
These items can be obtained from all variants of oak:

- Oak Log(harvested with any tool including hands)
- Oak Leaves(harvested withshears)
- Stick(chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
- Oak Planks(created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
- Stripped Oak Log(created byusinganaxeon a log)
- Oak Sapling(chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
- Apple(chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
- Mushrooms‌[Bedrock Edition  only](if present on a fallen oak log)
- Bee Nest(if spawned on an oak near flowers)
- Vines(harvested with shears from a swamp oak, or from a dying tree‌[Bedrock Edition  only])

## Planting
Oak saplings can be planted and grown on all of these blocks:

- Dirt
- Grass Block
- Coarse Dirt
- Podzol
- Mycelium
- Rooted Dirt
- Moss Block
- Farmland
- Mud
- Muddy Mangrove Roots

An oak requires a 1×1 column of unobstructed space at least 4 blocks above its sapling to grow (5 blocks including the sapling itself). Oaks can still grow when the base and trunk are enclosed on all sides. Their growth is not hindered by logs, leaves, dirt, or saplings.

An oak grown from a sapling within 2 blocks of a flower has a 5% chance of having a bee nest containing 2 bees.

## Other variant oaks

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition and  Minecraft Education. 


In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, trees can generate as one of the two following variants of the normal tree. Both of these generate naturally, and can be grown out of normal saplings.[1][2]

### Dying oak
Dying oaks retain their standard growth pattern. However, all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with vines. They can generate as regular or small oaks.

### Fallen oak log
These trees consist of a single upright log or stump. Logs lying on their side are often found 1–2 blocks from the stump. They occasionally have mushrooms on top.

A fallen oak has a log length of 4–7 blocks and the stump is 75% covered with vines.
