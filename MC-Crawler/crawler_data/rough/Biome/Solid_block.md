# Solid block
Solid blocks consist of any type of block that has a collision box that players, mobs, or other entities cannot simply move through, and  have to move on top of it or around.

## Properties
Players, mobs and other entities are able to walk on top of solid blocks. Particles that are affected by gravity (e.g. slime particles or water drip particles) also collide with solid blocks.

Mobs require a solid top surface to spawn. Some mobs are able to spawn inside of the space occupied by another block, but only if their hitbox does not intersect the collision of any solid block. See spawn conditions for more info.

1. ↑Hanging signs' mounting bracket is always solid.
2. ↑The top part is solid when standing on it, otherwise, players can phase through it by the sides.

## Height

  

This section needs to be updated. 
Please update this section to reflect recent updates or newly available information.Reason: List the ones in Bedrock Edition (due to a bug, they are different)


Most solid blocks are 1 block in height, but certain blocks have non-standard block heights.

A player can automatically step up from a lower to a higher height, if the difference is at most 0.6 (3⁄5) of a block. From ground level, this is anything the height of a chain or less.

A player can fit through spaces as small as 1.8125 (29⁄16) blocks high, since players are 1.8 blocks tall. This allows players to fit through a 2-block gap with a floor as high as a trapdoor.

When sneaking, a player can fit through spaces as small as 1.75 (7⁄4) blocks high‌[Bedrock Edition  only], or 1.5 blocks‌[Java Edition  only], since sneaking players are 1.65 blocks or 1.5 blocks tall, respectively. In Bedrock, this allows players to fit through a 2-block gap with a floor as high as 3 layers of snow. In Java, players can fit through a 2-block space with a floor as high as a slab.

When gliding with elytra, a player can fit through spaces as small as 0.625 (5⁄8) blocks high, since gliding players are 0.6 blocks tall. This allows players to fit through a 1-block gap with a floor as high as 4 layers of snow, a flower pot, or a daylight sensor.

Note that doors, although appearing to be one 2-meter-high block, are actually composed of two (top and bottom) 1-meter-high blocks.

Here is a list of blocks with non-standard heights, from tallest to shortest in height:

| Height  |                 |                | Block types                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Width

  

This article needs cleanup to comply with the style guide. [discuss]
Please help improve this page. The talk page may contain suggestions.


Many blocks are less than 1 meter wide on one or more sides.

The table below shows the widths of various blocks. If a block has several hit boxes of different sizes (for example: brewing stands), then each hitbox is listed separately. Blocks with sides of different widths are listed with cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) for each side, assuming that the block was placed from above, with the player facing north.

1. ↑ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r sThese blocks are also thinner, i.e. their length and width are less than that of a full block.
2. ↑Soul sand has inner collision boxes every eighth of a block, so there is a collision box at 1/8, 1/4, 3/8, 1/2, 5/8, and 3/4.
