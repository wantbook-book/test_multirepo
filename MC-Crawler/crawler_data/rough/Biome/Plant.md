# Plant
A plant can either be a plant structure or a plant block. A plant structure is composed entirely of plant blocks. Plant blocks include flowers, leaves, logs, propagules, roots, and crops. Aquatic plants can be found in water, and terrestial plants can be found on land. Most blocks on this page are renewable, generally by growing them. All plants can be put in the composter. Some plants and other vegetative bodies can generate underground.

Many food items are also made from plants, but are not listed here, because they are the crafting products of plants.
