## Description
Arboretum is a densely forested biome. All types of trees can generate here, in many variants:

- all variants ofpotato trees,
- small and largejungle trees,
- short and tallbirches,
- normal and "fancy"oaks,
- as well asacacias,cherrys,mangroves,sprucesanddark oaks.

Trees can generate very closely to each other, even with no gap between two trunks, which is not possible in Overworld biomes. Foliage color in arboretum is not uniform, and it can vary from block to block, sometimes resulting in one tree having multiple colors of leaves.

Additionally, both red and brown huge mushrooms generate.

Surface of arboretum is covered with peelgrass blocks. Short grass, potato plants, and many types of flowers (including potato flowers) grow on top of it. "Park lane" features generate commonly among trees, connecting different parts of the biome.

The following mobs are naturally spawned here:

Besides mentioned mobs, bees are common as well, due to trees generating many bee nests.
