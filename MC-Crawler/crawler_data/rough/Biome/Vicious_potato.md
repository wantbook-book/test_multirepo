### Natural generation
Vicious potatoes generate rarely in the hash biome, in Potato dimension. They usually generate in clusters of 2-6, and each vicious potato is sitting on top of a small pillar, made of gravtater blocks.

## Usage
Vicious potatoes shoot projectiles (known as vine_projectile in the code) that damage other entities. They shoot when they receive a random tick or a redstone signal, and there is an entity in a 31×31×31 cuboid, centered on the vicious potato block. Projectiles deal 5 damage and fly in a straight line, unaffected by gravity, but they can't pass through solid blocks. However, vicious potato doesn't "see" any obstacles and shoots projectiles regardless of any walls between it and the targeted entity.

Vicious potato attacks all mobs and players, and mobs don't try to run away from them, nor they consider the vicious potato as an enemy, because it isn't an entity. Even mobs with block-breaking abilities, like withers, don't try to destroy vicious potatoes that attack them.
