## Description
If created as a Buffet world, the between biome consists of a somewhat hilly terrain made out of stone. Some hills can reach Y=90. Biome is filled with an infinite fleet of end ships in a grid pattern, generating both in the sky and the underground. The fleet has three layers of end ships. Lowest blocks of lowest end ships generate at Y=50, and highest blocks of highest end ships generate at Y=173. There are no caves or any other terrain features. No mobs spawn naturally in this biome.

End ships are almost identical to those that spawn in end cities, with two key differences:

- noshulkersspawn on them,
- there is noitem framewithelytraor end city loot in thechest. Instead, each chest contain a single written book called"orders".

Brewing stands with Instant Health potions and dragon heads still generate.

In the fleet dimension, end ship fleet is identical, but the dimension generates no terrain: all the ships hover over the void.
