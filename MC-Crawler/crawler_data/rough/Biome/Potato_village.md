## Generation
Potato villages can generate in arboretum, corruption, or fields biomes. It often generates partially or even completely over the void, creating a small island for itself.

## Structure
Potato villages are very similar to plains villages, but instead using potato blocks. A potato variant of villagers spawn in this structure, as well as normal iron golems and cats like in other villages.

Farms use poison farmland and potato stem instead of farmland and logs, and housed are connected with roads made of poison paths. Potato fruit is generating both in piles (instead of hay bales) and as a light source, held by potato pedicules. Houses are made of potato stems, stairs, doors, and planks, as well as expired baked potato bricks, taterstone and its variants, strong roots and blocks of lime potato peels.

Small stations with frying tables are features unique to potato villages. Besides the frying table, these contain potato stairs, a bamboo pressure plate, and an item frame with a potato in it. A small tree-like object, made out of potato leaves and pedicules, generates above the frying table. One composter generates behind it.

Another feature unique to potato villages are hedge mazes, made out of potato leaves. These do not seem to serve any purpose besides decoration.
