## Obtaining
Unlike with other one-block-tall flowers in Bedrock Edition, players cannot spread wither roses on top of nearby grass blocks by applying bone meal on a wither rose.

### Mob loot
Any mob killed by the wither drops one wither rose upon death. If possible, the wither rose is placed on the block where the mob died. If the flower cannot be placed there, or if the game rule mobGriefing is set to false, the flower is dropped as an item instead. Wither roses are dropped even when the game rule doMobLoot is set to false.[1][2]

Endermen can pick up wither roses, like any other one-block-tall flower, and drop one if killed while holding it.

## Usage
Like most flowers, wither roses can be used as decoration and planted on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss blocks, mud, or muddy mangrove roots. They can also be planted on netherrack or soul sand. In Java Edition, wither roses can also be planted on soul soil.

### Damaging
When not in Peaceful difficulty, wither roses inflict the Wither effect to any players or non-immune mobs touching it, dealing 1 damage every half second. The effect lingers for 1 second after the player/mob leaves its block space. Wither skeletons, the wither, and the ender dragon are not affected due to their immunity to the Wither effect.

When placed in a flower pot, wither roses do not cause damage to any entity. In Bedrock Edition, when a wither rose is snowlogged, it does not emit particles and does not hurt entities.[3]

### Suspicious stew
Main article: Suspicious Stew
Using wither roses to make suspicious stew, whether by direct crafting or by feeding a brown mooshroom and then milking it with a bowl, imbues it with a Wither effect that lasts 8 seconds in Java Edition and 6 seconds in Bedrock Edition. It can inflict up to 4 damage.

### Mob spawning
The wither skeleton is the only mob capable of spawning inside a wither rose, when its spawning conditions are met.

### Bees
Bees attempt to pollinate wither roses, although they get damaged in the process.[4]

### Breeding
Wither roses can be used to breed, grow, and lead bees. This does not damage the bees.[5]

### Bee nests
Oak, birch, and cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of a wither rose have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest and 1-3 bees in it.

### Composting
Placing a wither rose into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of wither roses yields an average of 5.94 bone meal.
