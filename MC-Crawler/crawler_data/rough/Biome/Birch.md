# Birch
A birch is a tree that appears similar to a common oak in terms of height and leaves, but with light bark and pale wood. It is most commonly found in birch forest biomes. Tall birches are found only in old growth birch forest biomes and cannot be grown with saplings. As with oaks and cherries, a birch grown near flowers can generate with a bee nest attached.

## Appearance
Birches come in two different variants:

- Shorter birches can be grown by the player using birch saplings and are found inforest,birch forest,dark forestandmeadowbiomes.
- A taller, rare tree that can only be found inold growth birch forestsand rarely inmeadows[verify].

Birches that are grown from saplings grow to be 5 to 7 blocks tall, while birches in the old growth birch forest biome can generate with trunks up to 13 blocks in height.

## Leaf arrangement
Layer 1 (top)



















Layer 2





















Layers 3 and 4




































All birches lack branches. Birches always grow around 50 to 60 leaves. The leaf distributions are shown visually above, each table cell representing one 'slice' of the tree viewed from above. The transparent leaves represent areas where leaves may grow, but do not always. The growth pattern, in detail, is as follows:

- The topmost row is one above the height of the tree and always has exactly 5 leaves: one above the log and four orthogonally adjacent to it, forming a + shape.
	- 5 leaves
- The second row is the top of the trunk and also has 4 leaves adjacent to it. Diagonal leaf blocks grow from a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 3 corners of the log.
	- 5 - 7 leaves
- The third row has the log in the middle, surrounded orthogonally and diagonally by leaf blocks. Those 8 leaf blocks are also surrounded orthogonally, for an additional 12 leaf blocks. One can think of this as a 5×5 space where every block is leaves except the four corners. These corners are randomly filled with between 0 and 4 leaves, although having all four filled is rare.
	- 20 - 24 leaves
- The fourth row generates with the same rules like the third and thus has a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 24 leaf blocks.
	- 20 - 24 leaves
- The fifth and sixth (bottom) rows contain no leaves, only the log in the center. If the tree is 6 or 7 blocks tall, the additional 1 or 2 rows at the bottom are also just a log.
	- No leaves


Small oak and 1×1 jungle trees also have this arrangement of leaves.

## Generation
The birch variants spawn naturally in the indicated biomes:

| Biome                   | Birch | Tall Birch |
|-------------------------|-------|------------|
| Dark Forest             |       |            |
| Forest                  |       |            |
| Birch Forest            |       |            |
| Old Growth Birch Forest |       |            |
| Meadow                  |       |            |

## Blocks and items
These items can be obtained from birches, except that saplings cannot be obtained from tall birches:

- Bee Nest(if present on a tree near flowers)
- Birch Leaves(harvested withshears)
- Birch Log(harvested with any tool including hands)
- Birch Planks(created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
- Birch Sapling(normal birch only; chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
- Mushrooms‌[Bedrock Edition  only](if present on a fallen log)
- Stripped Birch Log(created byusinganaxeon a log)
- Stick(chance of dropping when breaking leaves)

## Planting
Birch saplings can be planted on:

- Dirt
- Grass Block
- Coarse Dirt
- Podzol
- Mycelium
- Rooted Dirt
- Moss Block
- Farmland
- Mud
- Muddy Mangrove Roots

Only normal birches can be grown from saplings. Tall birches only generate naturally in the world.

Birches require a 3×3 column of unobstructed space at least 6 blocks above the sapling to grow (7 blocks including the sapling itself). Additionally, birches require 5×5 layers without obstruction for the top 3 layers of its final height. No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree (a sapling planted in a hole 1 block deep can still grow).

A birch grown from a sapling and within 2 blocks of a flower has a 5% chance of having a bee nest containing 1–3 bees.

## Fallen birches

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition and  Minecraft Education. 


 

In Bedrock Edition, a fallen birch may consist of a single upright log, or a stump. Logs lying on their side are often found 1–2 blocks from the stump. They occasionally have mushrooms on top.

A fallen birch has a log length of 5–8 blocks. A fallen tall birch has a log length of 5–15 blocks. The stump is never covered in vines.

## Foliage colors
Main article: Tint
Birch leaves do not follow the foliage color rules that cause the trees to appear in different colors in different biomes. Birch leaves are always the same color regardless of the biome. In Bedrock Edition, however, they turn white as other leaves do during snowfall in snowy biomes.
