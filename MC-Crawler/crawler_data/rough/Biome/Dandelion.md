## Obtaining
### Breaking
A dandelion can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

A dandelion also breaks if water or lava runs over its location, if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

| Block    | Dandelion           |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 0                   |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.05                |

### Natural generation
Dandelions generate naturally on dirt and grass blocks in multiple biomes as part of vegetation features:

- Plains
- Sunflower Plains
- Savanna
- Savanna Plateau
- Windswept Savanna
- Snowy Plains
- Meadow
- Forest
- Flower Forest‌[Java Edition  only]
- Birch Forest
- Old Growth Birch Forest
- Taiga
- Old Growth Pine Taiga
- Old Growth Spruce Taiga
- Snowy Taiga
- Jungle
- Bamboo Jungle
- Sparse Jungle
- Dark Forest
- Windswept Hills
- Windswept Gravelly Hills
- Windswept Forest
- River
- Frozen River

The following additional biomes are also technically allowed to generate dandelions, although they very rarely or never generate grass blocks on the surface in normal worlds. As a result, dandelions can generate only in edge cases or custom worlds.

- Beach
- Snowy Beach
- Stony Shore
- Ocean
- Deep Ocean
- Cold Ocean
- Deep Cold Ocean
- Frozen Ocean
- Deep Frozen Ocean
- Lukewarm Ocean
- Deep Lukewarm Ocean
- Warm Ocean
- Desert
- Ice Spikes
- Dripstone Caves
- Deep Dark
- Lush Caves‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
- Grove‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
- Snowy Slopes‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
- Stony Peaks‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
- Jagged Peaks‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
- Frozen Peaks‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

In jungles, bamboo jungles, sparse jungles, savannas and savanna plateaus, dandelions are twice as common as in other biomes. In flower forests and meadows, dandelions only generate as part of gradients.

Natural dandelions are found in plains and savanna villages. Potted dandelions can also generate in woodland mansions.


### Post-generation
Main article: Flower § Post-generation
#### Java Edition
When bone meal is applied to a grass block in one of the biomes listed above (except those marked as ‌[Bedrock Edition  only]), dandelions have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area. In meadows and flower forests, dandelions can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains, sunflower plains, dripstone caves, and the deep dark, dandelions cannot generate in tulip-only areas.

#### Bedrock Edition
When bone meal is applied to a grass block in any biome except swamp and flower forest, dandelions have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 7×5×7 area. Unlike Java Edition, bone meal can generate dandelions anywhere within a meadow biome. In plains and sunflower plains dandelions cannot generate in tulip-only areas.

When bone meal is applied to a dandelion that has been placed on top of a grass block in any biome, more dandelions appear on top of nearby grass blocks. Poppies can also occasionally appear, and dandelions can occasionally appear when bone meal is applied to poppies. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.

### Mob loot
Endermen can pick up dandelions, like any other one-block-tall flower, and drop one if killed while holding it.

### Chest loot

### Trading
Wandering traders may sell a dandelion for a single emerald.

## Usage
Main article: Flower § Usage
Like other flowers, dandelions can be used as decoration and planted on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss blocks, mud, or muddy mangrove roots.

Dandelions can also be placed in flower pots.

### Suspicious stew
Main article: Suspicious Stew
Using a dandelion to make suspicious stew, whether by direct crafting or by feeding a brown mooshroom and then milking it with a bowl, imbues it with a Saturation effect that lasts 0.35 seconds in Java Edition and 0.3 seconds in Bedrock Edition. The Saturation effect restores an additional 7 () hunger and 14 saturation in Java Edition, or 6 () hunger and 12 saturation in Bedrock Edition.

### Bees
Bees engage in a pollinating behavior with dandelions, increasing the honey level in beehives and bee nests by 1.

### Breeding
Dandelions can be used to breed, grow, and lead bees and rabbits.

### Bee nests
Oak, birch, and cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of a dandelion have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest and 1-3 bees in it.

### Composting
Placing a dandelion into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of dandelions yields an average of 5.94 bone meal.
