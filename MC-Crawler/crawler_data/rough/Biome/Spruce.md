# Spruce
Spruces and pines are trees with dark bark and brown wood. They have growth patterns and requirements similar to birches, although they appear different. They are mainly found in the taiga biome, but they may also generate in windswept forests, snowy plains, snowy taigas, old growth taigas, and groves.

## Appearance
Spruces come in several different variants with different properties:

- Spruces are the most common variant with a height between 5 and 12 blocks. The leaves tend to grow in discrete rows rather than the more spherical arrangement of oaks and birch trees. InBedrock Edition, only this variant can be grown using saplings.
- Pines are a fairly tall variant of spruces which generate in a matchstick style, with only a few leaves at the top.
- Mega spruces are larger variants of spruces which generate in theold growth spruce taiga. They have considerably more leaves than the mega pine. InBedrock Edition, only this variant can be grown using saplings.
- Mega pines are a larger variant of pines which generate in theold growth pine taiga. These pines have few leaves, concentrated at the top, and can be grown from spruce saplings arranged in a 2×2 square, with or without bone meal.

## Generation
The spruce variants spawn naturally in the indicated biomes:

| Biome                   | Spruce | Mega Spruce | Pine | Mega Pine   |
|-------------------------|--------|-------------|------|-------------|
| Old Growth Spruce Taiga |        |             |      | ‌[BE  only] |
| Old Growth Pine Taiga   |        | ‌[BE  only] |      |             |
| Snowy Taiga             |        |             |      |             |
| Snowy Plains            |        |             |      |             |
| Taiga                   |        |             |      |             |

The maximum reach of podzol that can spawn from a mega spruce tree.
In an amplified taiga or old growth taiga, some of the spruces generate with snow on them, just like in the other cold biomes.

When mega spruces grow, they convert any grass blocks, dirt, mycelium, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, mud, muddy mangrove roots, and moss blocks‌[Java Edition  only][1] up to a radius of 6 blocks to podzol, centered on the south-eastern sapling.

Like birches, they do not grow branches. When height-constrained, the trunk height maximum is two less than the roof. The headroom of 9 blocks limits the tree to a trunk height of 7, which enables harvesting from ground level.

## Blocks and items
These items can be obtained from all variants of spruce.

- Spruce Log(harvested with any tool including hands)
- Spruce Leaves(harvested withshears)
- Stick(chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
- Spruce Planks(created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
- Stripped Spruce Log(created byusinganaxeon a log)
- Spruce Sapling(chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
- Vines‌[Bedrock Edition  only](harvested with shears from dying trees)
- Mushrooms‌[Bedrock Edition  only](if present on a fallen log)

## Planting
Spruce saplings may be planted and grown on:

- Dirt
- Grass Block
- Coarse Dirt
- Podzol
- Mycelium
- Rooted Dirt
- Moss Block
- Farmland
- Mud
- Muddy Mangrove Roots

In order to grow a 2×2 tree (be it mega spruce or mega pine), four saplings must be placed adjacent to each other in a square. For growth to succeed, there must be no blocks adjacent (even diagonally) to the north-western side up to the final height of the tree. Bone meal can be used on any of the saplings. The largest mega spruces and mega pines reach 30 blocks tall.

1×1 spruces require a 5×5 column of unobstructed space at least 7 blocks above the sapling to grow (8 blocks including the sapling itself). No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree and 1 level above (a sapling planted in a hole 2 blocks deep can still grow).

2×2 mega spruces require a 5×5 column of unobstructed space at least 14 blocks above the saplings to grow (15 blocks including the saplings themselves). This column is centered on the northwestern sapling. A 3×3 area is required at the base of the tree (the level of the saplings).

## Other variant spruces

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition and  Minecraft Education. 


In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, trees can generate as one of the two following variants of the normal tree. Both of these generate naturally, and can be grown out of normal saplings.[2][3]

The different dying tree types.
Fallen spruce log.
### Dying trees
Dying spruces and dying pines retain their standard growth pattern. However, all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with vines.

### Fallen spruces and pines
A fallen spruce may consist of a single upright log, or a stump. Logs lying on their side are often found 1–2 blocks from the stump. They occasionally have mushrooms on top.

A fallen spruce log has a length of 6–10 blocks, and the stump is never covered with vines.


## Foliage colors
Main article: Tint
Spruce leaves do not follow the foliage color rules that cause the trees to appear in different colors in different biomes. Spruce leaves are always the same color regardless of the biome. In Bedrock Edition, however, they turn white as other leaves do during snowfall in snowy biomes.
