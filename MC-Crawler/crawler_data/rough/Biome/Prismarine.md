### Natural generation
Prismarine naturally generate as the main blocks making up ocean monuments. Normal prismarine are found in large amounts due to the size of the structure. 

Normal prismarine can also be found in ocean ruins.

## Usage
The color change of prismarine
Prismarine can be used for decoration or as a high blast resistance building block.

The normal prismarine is uniquely useful for decoration as it has an animated texture. The cracks in prismarine slowly cycle in color through light blue, green, purple, and dark blue. The full animation for the prismarine texture changes color 22 times in an irregular sequence before the whole pattern repeats; this takes 5 minutes and 30 seconds.

### Conduit power
Main article: Conduit
Prismarine can be used to activate a conduit by building a structure around it. By doing this, the conduit emits the "Conduit Power" effect in a certain radius, depending on how many blocks are used to power it. Sea lanterns can also be used for this purpose.
