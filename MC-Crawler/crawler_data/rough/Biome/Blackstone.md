1. ↑Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

### Natural generation
Blackstone generates naturally in the Nether, particularly in the basalt deltas biome, below the surface of a lava sea, and anywhere underground.

Blackstone can be found as a part of bastion remnants.

Ore blobs of blackstone attempt to replace netherrack 2 times per chunk in blobs of size 0 to 160, from levels 5 to 31‌[JE  only]/36‌[BE  only], in all Nether biomes except basalt deltas.

In Java Edition, blackstones also generate in big blobs, which attempt to replace netherrack 25 times per chunk in blobs of radius 3—7, from levels 0 to 127, in basalt deltas biome.


### Bartering
Piglins may barter 8-16 blocks of blackstone when given a gold ingot.

## Usage
Blackstone can be used as a substitute for cobblestone in the Nether as it can be used to craft stone tools, brewing stands and furnaces. In Java Edition it can also be used to repair stone tools using an anvil. It can also be used to craft polished blackstone.

Blackstone cannot be used to craft dispensers, droppers, pistons or other blocks that use cobblestone in their recipes.[1]
