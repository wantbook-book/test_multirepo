# Old Customized
Customized (retroactively labelled Old Customized in 20w21a) was a world type that replaced the normal terrain of the Overworld with custom generation. It was removed in 18w06a with the rewrite of world generation. It was replaced with the Buffet world type in 18w16a, with all configuration removed other than biome and terrain shaping type. Custom worlds returned in a new format in 20w21a.

If the level is set below the default, land masses are bigger, and rivers may be shallow or dry. All land below level 63 is gravel. For low settings, the ocean may be reduced to small lakes, may be restricted to underground caves and caverns, or sometimes even doesn't exist. If the level is set above the default, low-lying biomes such as swamps are fragmented or nonexistent, creating a world with smaller land masses. Rivers are not "rivers" in the literal sense, but are more like subsurface valleys. The world may, at high levels, consist of sparse islands separated by deep water or may be all ocean, as in the Water World preset. Setting it to a negative value causes chunks never to load, always displaying "Waiting for chunk..." in the F3 menu.

This is not the actual number of dungeons per chunk - as not all attempts are successful. This is because they generate only next to an opening. This means that at a setting of 100%, few or no dungeons generate when the ground does not provide an opening for connecting to the right places. For example, in a world with only ravines, two dungeons generated at a setting of 100%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Water lakes can generate where there is no opening, unlike dungeons. Therefore, the underground water lakes are usually discovered by chance while digging.

Increasing the number by one doubles the size of biomes. The generation of oceans and lakes are independent of biome size. Biomes are magnified from the origin (0,0). Even in a single-biome world, this makes a difference; in a desert world, higher "biome size" seems to predispose toward flatter terrain and more villages and temples, while a lower setting results in steeper, more rugged terrain with fewer villages and temples. See alsoLarge Biomes. Note that hill biomes and mutated biomes still generate in single biome worlds, respective of the base biome used to generate, and their locations change depending on biome size. While the slider is hard coded between sizes 1 through 8. Editing the JSON allows biome sizes from 0 and up to generate. Biome size 0 is 1/16th the default world's size 4. At sizes 20-23, much of the world is just a single biome for a million blocks or so, at size 31, it would extend over 2 billion blocks if the hard coded wall at 30 million is removed, so setting the biome size above 31 usually makes no difference, even at extremely large distances. |

Decreasing the number by one doubles the proximity of rivers to each other. So while slightly larger rivers result from changing this 2 points, approximately 3 times as many rivers generate. At a setting of 1, rivers generate through most of the landscape; at 5, there are large tracts of land with no water. Rivers are magnified from the origin (0,0) so increasing the value by 1 doubles the distance to a river. If the sea level is reduced far below 63, many "rivers" generate dry although their beds aredirtregardless of the surrounding biome. While the slider is hard coded between sizes 1 through 5. Editing the JSON allows biome sizes from 0 and up to generate. River size 0 is 1/16th the default world's size 4, meaning nearly the entire world is covered in rivers. At sizes 20-23, over 1 million blocks separate rivers, at size 31, rivers could be effectively removed or impossible to find, even if the hard coded wall at 30 million is removed, so setting the river size any higher than 31 is usually ineffective, even at extremely large distances.                |

### Ore settings
Each of the eleven sections of this page modifies the generation settings for each type of ore. These settings can be used to change the distribution of almost all any ore and mineral type. The only exception is emerald ore, as it generates only in extreme hills biomes, and the blob size is always one block; as its distribution is hard coded, it cannot be changed. The distribution of natural resources in the Nether (Nether quartz ore and magma block) also cannot be changed.

Apart from the above exceptions, the blob size, number and distribution are set. Here are the default settings:

** Notes **
1. ↑ a bThe Lapis Lazuli distribution follows its own rules : instead of a minimum and a maximum height, it is based on a center height and a spread value. By default, these values are set to 16, meaning that Lapis Lazuli can generate within levels 0 to 32, mostly around level 16.
2. ↑ a bAlthough 256 is the maximum height, adjusting the slider moves the values from 0-255. Resetting to Default or manually editing the preset code text is the only way to observe 256 on the slider if it has been moved.

### Advanced settings
There are 16 customization options that can be used to affect various aspects of Minecraft's terrain generator. These settings appear on two pages: one with sliders, and one that allows for text input. On the manual text input page, typing in any value lower or higher than the allowed parameter changes the value to the lowest or highest value possible for that customization option. The settings change only the mountains and valleys of the landscape; structures and other environmental factors (which are set on page 1) remain unaffected.

Minecraft uses noise generators, specifically those making use of Perlin noise to create the randomness of its terrain. Perlin noise is a method for generating noise that transitions smoothly and looks more natural than 'regular' noise.

The Minecraft world generator uses many Perlin noise functions to generate the surface terrain. Three Perlin noise functions are combined to form the standard hills: a main function (Main Noise), a lower limit (Lower Limit) and a ceiling (Upper Limit). The world generator is calculated for each coordinate (X, Z) by comparing the average value between the lower limit and upper limit to the value of the main function. The base height (Depth Base) determines the separation between the standard hills and valleys and is independent from sea level.[1]

The default scenery is not seen in the finished world, because each biome has specific properties. Plains are flat, hills have small to medium elevations, extreme mountains are high mountain ranges, oceans have deep valleys, savannas and mesas have low mountains with flat plateaus, etc. Each biome type has an individual biome depth (Biome Depth) and an individual biome factor (Biome Scale) in order to perform the biome specific deformations.

| Depth Base Size      | 1–25       | 8.5     | Decides at which height the surface is generated, before anything else is manipulated. But unlike a stretch effect, this gives more ground to be manipulated. Any change in the value of 1 corresponds to a variation of the base height by 8 levels. The value 0 cannot be set because of the base amount at least still the bedrock level must be generated. The default value of 8.5 corresponds to the base height of 68, which is slightly above sea level (level 63).Below default: The base amount is below sea level. If this is not adjusted, the area is flooded. If the value is set to "1", this corresponds to the base height 8, which is below the lava level (height 11). This lava flows from the cave openings, because all caves are automatically filled to the lava level with lava. The lava lakes, which are normally in the underground, emerge openly, because there are only a few layers underground. Rivers have dried up, when the sea level is lower. Structures are generated, they stand on pillars (villages) or float in the air (mineshafts).<br/>Above default: The higher the value, the longer it takes to generate the landscape. At the maximum value, the base height is 200. River valleys are deeply incised and yet dried up, because they do not reach the sea. Mountains are higher and more above the base height than normal. It is appropriate to adjust the distribution of the ore to the base height.<br/> |

| Upper Limit Scale    | 1–5000     | 512     | Make terrain more solid/riddled with holes depending on how close the values are to the lower limit scale values. Note however, that it is used in cave/cavern generation, and so setting them far apart with caves/caverns turned off doesn't give you holed terrain.Below default: The lower the value, the longer it takes to generate the landscape. This raises the heights of some mountains and parts of the entire landscape sharply without changing their positions, while other parts of the landscape remain unchanged. The increase in height is nonlinear. Values close to the minimum already have an enormous impact, but the larger values have a lower the impact. At the minimum value, the surface is calculated well above the maximum height and capped at level 256. This leads to completely flat planes. There are huge cavities where the walls are not rounded, but have rather smooth, blocky edges.<br/>Above default: The same mountains that extend when lowering the value in the height is always flatter while raising the value, while the mountains of the other parts of the landscape remain unchanged.

This setting has the same effect as the Upper Limit Scale, except that it affects parts of the landscape that the Upper Limit Scale does not affect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Biome Depth Weight   | 1–20       | 1       | Changes the height of the biomes. With increasing value the heights of the biomes are increased, without affecting the rest of the landscape. A maximum setting of 20 results in cone mountains that would exceed the maximum height of 256 meters and cap there. Large valleys of normal landscape generate between the mountains. The middle screenshot shows the value of 3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Biome Depth Offset   | 0–20       | 0       | Determines the surface level of the biome. The surface level of the biome is raised, but not the height of the features of the biome (e.g. hills). For example, in a tundra biome the surface at a setting of 0 is near the ocean level as normal. When set to 2, the surface is already at 100 meters, at 5 it is 150 meters and 10 at 250 meters. A further increase of the value leads to surfaces that would exceed the maximum height of 256 meters. The landscape is then capped. Therefore, at the maximum value 20, only a smooth, green sectional area at the level of 256 is visible. If set to -3.75 through a custom preset, the would-be sea level coincides approximately with layer 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Biome Scale Weight   | 1–20       | 1       | Determines the weight of biome specific characteristics. With increasing values, these characteristics are weighted more heavily.
