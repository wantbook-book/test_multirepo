## Accessing
To enter the Potato, player must find a ruined potato portal structure, and use a poisonous potato on the pedestal block. This creates a potato portal, which, when entered, takes the player to Potato dimension.

## Traits
The Potato is composed of floating islands, similarly to an unused Sky dimension, Floating Islands worlds or the Aether, a dimension from a popular Minecraft mod. 

Just like in the End, there is no floor or ceiling, and players can easily fall into the void if not careful enough. When that happens, a modified version of the end poem is displayed.


Poem transcript
The nightshades stir. We are not alone in here.PLAYERNAME?Ah, yes, I see it now. The player tugging at the starchy strands of reality.Do you think it knows? Do you think it wants to know?It cannot. A mere lateral stem, branching off from the main into an endless sea of potatobilities, forever longing for the warmth of the mother tuber.Solanum tuberosum.We should not dwell on such things. It is the nature of all perennial dreams. To know without remembering. Seeing how, but never knowing why.Maybe PLAYERNAME is different?The [scrambled] forbids it. We count time in potateons, far-reaching stolons stretching out across the [scrambled]. This player is just passing by.Will it remember us afterwards?It is possible, but not in the sense that you hope for. The dauphinoise is layered in ways that even we cannot fathom.We will still be here, long after this potato patch has been folded into the velvety mash of time.As the starch commands. The player will not.I wish we could spend more time with PLAYERNAME. Make it remember that [scrambled] will [scrambled] after it leaves us.The skin must not be peeled. The player would not understand.Great solanaceae, it must not be peeled..You remember our old adage. We shall guide it on its journey though.I like this player, can I say the words?Yes, but do not linger. The time of harvest is almost upon us. The door is closing.PLAYERNAME, listen to my voice..Good.Boiled, baked, roasted or fried, always trust in the potato. You are one with the tubers now.You are the potato.Time to sprout.


When the poem finishes (or is skipped), player respawns high above their normal spawn point, wearing poisonous pota-toes.

Daylight cycle in the Potato occurs as normal, but the sun has a different texture, slightly resembling a poisonous potato. Clouds and weather exist as well: it never snows, but rain and thunder can occur.  Rain has green tint and it is visible only below Y=110, in all biomes except the hash biome. Rain is poisonous in the wasteland biome.

Both water and lava behave just like in the Overworld, with the exception of wasteland biome, where water is poisonous. Beds work normally, while respawn anchors explode, also mimicking the Overworld. However piglins, piglin brutes and hoglins don't get zombified in the Potato, unlike the Overworld.

## Environment
Five biomes generate in the Potato:

- Arboretum



- Corruption



- Fields



- Hash



- Wasteland



Caves cut through the terrain, which is composed of blocks similar to those found in Overworld:

- Peelgrass blockandcorrupted peelgrass blockare the equivalent ofgrass blocks,
- Terre de pommeis the equivalent ofdirt,
- Poison pathandpoison farmlandare equivalents ofdirt pathandfarmland, respectively,
- Potoneandtaterstoneare equivalents ofstoneandcobblestone,
- Gravtateris the equivalent ofsand.

Many more blocks spawn in blobs or other types of terrain features: these include blocks of potato peels, slime blocks, ancient debris or potato buds. All types of Overworld ores have their potone equivalent and generate in this dimension; additionally there is one dimension-specific ore, the resin ore.

### Generated structures
The following types of structures generate in the Potato:

- Buried treasure
- Colosseum
- Potato mineshaft
- Potato village
- Ruined portatol
- Shipwreck
- Witch hut

All types of Overworld trees, as well as huge mushrooms, can spawn in this dimension. There also exist a tree native only to this dimension, the potato tree. Normal potato plants can be found commonly in any biome (especially in fields biome), growing on peelgrass, corrupted peelgrass, poison farmland or gravtater.

Amethyst geodes and potato geodes can generate too, as well as hash wells, which are variants of desert wells.

Besides the normal clouds, a cloud-like blobs of floatato blocks generate between the islands. Rarely a tall spire of terre de pomme appears on the surface of this dimension.

### Mobs
Many Overworld mobs can spawn in the Potato, with most of them having a different potato-like texture variant, specific to this dimension. These include skeletons, strays, creepers, endermen, spiders, villagers, cows, chickens, sheep, pigs, bees and armadillos.

Other Overworld mobs spawn, but don't have a potato-like texture: these include cats, iron golems, bats, witches, zombies, phantoms, slimes and glow squids.

There are also mobs native to the Potato that are separate entities: poisonous potato zombies, batatos, toxifin slabs, plaguewhale slabs and the mega spud, which is the main boss of this dimension.

Piglin brutes, ghasts and giants can spawn during the battle with mega spud. Giants spawned in this dimension have the skin of Mojang Studios developer Jay Wells.
