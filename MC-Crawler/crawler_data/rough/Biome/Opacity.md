# Opacity
Opacity (and its inverse, transparency) are properties of blocks which affect how the game renders it and other nearby blocks, as well as how occlusion culling is handled.

## Properties
The primary purpose of opacity is to tell the game engine if it needs to render other blocks behind that block; an opaque block completely obscures the view behind it, while a transparent block does not. Therefore, transparency applies not only to solid blocks like ice and glass, but also to blocks like cacti, stairs, chests, and single slabs, which are not considered full blocks.
By this definition, transparency does not imply that a block is actually see-through, which is a quality of the item texture specified by the game or resource pack.

Water that is completely surrounded by water or opaque blocks does not have a current. However, if one of the surrounding blocks is transparent, the water shows a downward current on its side, like a waterfall, although swim speed through that water remains unchanged.

Opacity is independent of redstone conductivity and spawnability for full blocks, although they often coincide. A slime block is an example of this independence: a slime block is partially light-transparent and has a see-through texture, but still conducts redstone power and allows mob spawning on top.

## Lighting
Opacity also affects how light propagates through the world. Opaque blocks completely prevent light from traveling through them, while transparent blocks generally diminish the light by one light level per block (these value can be overridden however, and there are several exceptions).

The growth of grass blocks is linked to the amount of light in the blocks directly above them. A grass block can be killed by placing an opaque or partially transparent block above it.

Some transparent blocks can reduce or block light, according to type:

- Glassandcarpetsdo not reduce the light passing through them, i.e. there is no additional modifier. In other words, light passes through them as if it wereair.
- Lavais set to completely block light propagation. This is often unnoticeable sincelavahas the maximum light level of 15, but can be observed in cases where lava blocks skylight propagation.
- Water,ice,leaves,slime blocks,honey blocks, andcobwebsdo not have any extra effect on block light, but they do diffuse sky light.
	- InBedrock Edition, water and ice have a -1 modifier to light propagation, on top of the normal decrease of 1 per block.
	- The light level fromsunlightormoonlightis the same in each block of air in the column of air above the highest obstruction in the column. When placed, water, ice, leaves, slime blocks, honey blocks, and cobwebs obstruct that light column so that the lowest air block above the leaves acts as other light sources do.
- Sunlight is attenuated byleavesand each vertical layer of leaf blocks attenuates the light further.
