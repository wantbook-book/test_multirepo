## Description
Mangrove swamp biomes are a variant of the swamp biome featuring very dense mangrove trees which vary in height. The floor is mainly composed of mud blocks with occasional grass block or dirt disks. Seagrass litters the bottom of flooded areas and lily pads dot the surfaces of the water.

In Java Edition, unlike most of overworld biomes, mushrooms do not generate here. The grass has the same color as the normal swamp but leaves and vines have a unique light green tint and the water is teal rather than gray. Warm frogs and tropical fish are the only passive animals that spawn in this biome. 

Mangrove swamp biomes, alongside deserts and regular swamps, can generate fossils underground. However, swamp huts do not generate here.[1]

Mangrove swamp biomes are usually found in flat terrain near sea level in regions with very high erosion values, and they also replace rivers in these areas. Mangrove swamps never directly border the ocean, with some other biomes generating between them instead. However, their water bodies are often connected to the ocean. They generate next to savannas, most windswept savannas, some forests, some plains, jungles, sparse jungles, bamboo jungles, and deserts. 

Underwater fog is thick here so visibility is also lower than other biomes when the player is underwater.

Slimes may spawn in swamps during the night, exclusively between Y=50 and Y=70, making swamps and mangrove swamps the only places where slimes can be found above ground. Their spawn rate is affected by the moon phase, spawning most often during full moon and not spawning at all during new moon. Bogged add an additional threat to the night, as their poison arrows can increase the danger of hostile mobs. ‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0]

Villagers that spawn in mangrove swamps get a unique swamp-themed look. While villagers have swamp-specific types, no village featuring exclusively these villagers can be generated. The only way for these villagers to spawn is either by a villager being bred in the swamp or mangrove swamp biomes, or for a zombie villager that spawned in a swamp to be cured.

The following mobs naturally spawn here：
