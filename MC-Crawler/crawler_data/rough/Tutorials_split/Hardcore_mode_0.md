# Tutorials/Hardcore mode
Hardcore worlds are one of the most unforgiving types of Minecraft world. It can take many attempts before actually reaching the credits, which can be frustrating. This article focuses on Singleplayer Hardcore strategies, many, but not all, of which can apply to other game modes.

Before beginning a Hardcore world, it is advisable to beat the game on Hard a few times. Learn to act quickly and effectively. After starting a Hardcore world, it may be helpful to practice on other non-Hardcore worlds, especially to prepare for fighting the ender dragon.

With Hardcore mode, it may be worth copying the world before you take the risk.

## How to replicate Hardcore in Bedrock 1.18
### Simple Method
This method is really simple, but it does provide an opportunity to cheat.

1. Create a Survival world in Hard mode
2. Delete the world when you die
3. If you want, use a texture pack to change the texture of the heart
4. If you die you can keep the world but you can only play in Spectator mode

As you can probably imagine, you might end up cheating the system and respawning, and it does not permanently turn off cheats.  However, if you want to get achievements in the world, this is the only way to do it unmodded.

### 
Here is how to (kind of) make a hardcore world in Bedrock. (Note: This design replicates hardcore in Java versions 1.0.0 - 1.3.1, without the textures (unless you have a texture/resource pack that does the job))

1. Make a world (set the world settings to whatever you like, as long as it's in hard difficulty (Turn off "Natural Regeneration" for an Ultra hardcore world).
2. Go into creative and get Bedrock, get a Command Block using the /give command, a Pressure Plate (be sure that it's not weighted![needsÂ testing]), a light source (optional)
3. Build a bedrock room (big enough to fit all of the blocks necessary)
4. Build either design (Legend: P = Pressure Plate, C1 = command block (CB) (command: /tag @p DEAD(Settings: Default)) C2 = CB (command: /kick @a(tag=DEAD)YourReasonHere(Settings: Repeat, Always Active)), C3 = CB (command: /spawnpoint @a <x,y,z of your P>(Settings: Repeat, Always Active), B = Bedrock, LS = Light Source (optional)
5. Stand on C3, then type the following command /tickingarea add circle ~ ~-1 ~ 4 SPAWN
6. Enclose the box (Be sure the player won't suffocate in there!)
7. Reset the world spawn (so players can actually play without getting kicked out of the game right off the bat)

## Tips
- Always watch your back. Some of the most common deaths are from acreeper, which is almost completely silent and produces a devastating explosion, or aghast, which shoots fireballs from extremely far away. The fastest way a creeper can get to you is dropping from above.
- Fall damage is a common way of dying, so wearing boots withFeather FallingIV can be helpful as you are unlikely to die of fall damage unless your health is low.
- Never attack two creepers in a row or at once. The same goes for skeletons because their long-range shooting means it's hard to get in close.
- Shields are inexpensive to make, but can save your life if you get trapped with a creeper or skeleton.
- Never take unnecessary risks. Sometimes there are necessary risks, but most things probably are not worth the chance of death or losing a lot of health that may lead to death. For example, in most situations, it's better to bridge a gap over a lava ocean to a Nether Fortress than to throw an ender pearl to get over there.
- Mobile inventory space can be increased through the use ofender chests,shulker boxes,horses,donkeys,mules, andllamaswith a chest.
- Don't be afraid to place plenty oftorchesall over the ground. Surviving is easier in a well-lit area.
- Bedsare critical, especially early game. They bypass monsters spawning at night (and preventphantoms). This is helpful for exploring the surface and gathering basic resources in safety. To save materials, break and reuse the same bed. Normally breaking a bed is a bad idea (as you spawn in the world spawn if you die), but in Hardcore mode, you do not respawn.
- Avoid going out at night until you're well prepared, with iron or diamond equipment, and preferably a safe zone to retreat to. If night suddenly falls upon you, retreat to a shelter (if one is close enough), or build one. Even a simple pillar is helpful for surviving the night (Keep in mind that skeletons can still damage you with their ranged attacks, so you may consider building a two blocks tall walls around you to avoid arrows). Spiders can also reach you if your pillar is not high enough. 16 blocks is enough to keep them away.
- Avoid dangerous areas early in the game such as caves and ravines. It's best to stay away until you are better equipped with iron armor and tools.
- Wear your best set of armor at all times, replacing it as it gets worn. You can also enchant your armor with Mending so it can always be repairable. Remember that unenchanted armor doesn't protect you against falling damage, Poison, Hunger, etc.
- Avoid lags and don't use glitches. You won't want to have your computer lag for an hour and then find out that you died when the lag was occurring.
- Sometimes it's better to flee than fight. Always have a solid block on your hotbar and practice key binding so you can build a barricade and shelter on short notice.
- Try to keep yourhungermeter full at all times; regenerating health might save your life and eating in the middle of combat can be hard to do. Remember: hunger can kill you.
	- Walk and avoid jumping when you are not being pursued by a mob. Sprinting can deplete a lot of your hunger bar if you are not careful.
		- While walking around, try to punch passive mobs with meat drops to death, such aspigs, which dropporkchops.
	- Do not jump too much. It takes down your hunger bar if you are not careful. Use stairs and ladders instead of jumping if you are low on food, but it may be hard to find the resources to have many of them.
	- Try not to take unnecessary damage. The fastest way to lose a full hunger bar is regenerating health.
- Try to have a stable good food supply like a potato farm or a pig/cow farm so you can worry less about conserving hunger.
- Do everything you can to make sure that you are not overrun by monsters. Plan ahead and leave escape routes ready. Digging into the side of a mountain to make an emergency dugout shelter should only be done in extreme emergencies.
- It's a good idea to keep a milk bucket and a water bucket on you at all times, with the milk on your hotbar while on the surface to counter witches' potions, and the water while mining just in case you run into lava and need to put yourself out. If mining inthe Nether, put a Fire Resistancepotioninstead of your water bucket in case you mine into lava.
- Be careful when updating sand or gravel, as it can fall and suffocate you or drop you into hazards.
- When you find enough gold, make agolden apple, put it in your hotbar, and never remove it. This could save you and is by far the best use of gold. A potion of healing also works, preferably a splash potion as you can use it faster and it hurts undead mobs, likezombies. On a similar note, always keep a weapon on your hotbar.  If you are lucky enough to find anEnchanted Golden Apple, also put it in your hotbar.
- Don't worry about storing items away. If you die, you lose everything regardless if you stored or not. It is important, however, to clear out inventory clutter. Keep anything useful in organized chests and in yourEnder Chestso it can be retrieved quickly.
- TheCurse of Vanishingenchantment doesn't affect anything.
- It is recommended to avoid armor with theCurse of Bindingenchantment, because once you put it on, you can't get it off unless it breaks or you die. This is also good advice for regular worlds, but the consequences are far less in regular survival than in hardcore.  If you put on a pumpkin head or a mob head with the enchantment, you can never remove them as they cannot break.
- Avoidwoodland mansionsuntil you have at least full enchanted diamond armor and a diamond sword. Theevokersare dangerous, but more so are thevexesthey spawn, as they dodge constantly and can go through blocks, usually spawned in groups of 3 or more.Vindicatorscan deal heavy damage to the player, killing the player in a few hits even with Protection 4 netherite armor.
- Kill any iron golem that villages spawn with lava or pillar up three blocks high and do not use them for protection. It's a tempting idea, but if you misclick and provoke them they can kill you in a single hit, even with full iron armor.  Even with Protection 4 netherite armor, they can kill you quickly if you get stuck.
	- Instead, make the iron golems for protection. They do not attack when provoked when they are made by players.
- It is possible to lose up to 19 and 16 HP, while using aProtection4 diamond and netheritearmorset when acreeperexplodes. Consider usingBlast Protectiongear (if possible) when exploring caves as it brings down the maxdamageto 10 and 9 HP. Note that these values are worst-case scenarios, but worth considering if planning to continue after beating the game.
- If you believe that it is difficult to win a fight, just flee. Taking the risk can lead to death or losing a revival item such as thetotem of undyingor agolden apple.
- Never AFK on Hardcore mode. The last thing you want is to come back and realize that you got killed.  If you must AFK, pause the game, and if you are trying to AFK overnight to get lots of items from automatic farms, block yourself in to prevent a single mob from coming in and killing you.
- Accept that at some point, you die and you lose your world. You are never safe, so be prepared for that moment to say goodbye to your world.  If you want to build something huge and you do not want to play with backups, you have to accept the eventual loss of all your hard work.
- If exploring in the End, be careful because falling into the Void results in instant death, and this is the one situation a Totem of Undying cannot save you.  Equipping anelytraandfirework rocketscan save your world if you have fast enough reactions.  On that note, it is generally much safer to build bridges instead of throwing Ender Pearls.  Even if it takes a long time to build, it serves as a permanent pathway between the islands, and pearling has a relatively high chance of hitting the side of an island and causing you to die in the Void.  If you're really paranoid, build railings on your bridge.
- Always have atotem of undyingin your off-hand, for the inevitable need to save your life.  If you have multiple, bring a couple spares in your inventory to quickly put back in your off-hand.
- Do not respond to pressure from other people. You are the only one who truly knows your skill level. Don't make stupid mistakes like trying to impress your friends with things like 4-block jumps over lava. If you truly feel that something is too dangerous for you, don't do it, and take the easy way out. You may get too full of yourself and think that you are invincible to death or are too good for safety, but you are not, no matter what.  If you choose to do these risky behaviors, bring precautions (like a Totem of Undying or Fire Resistance Potion) in case you do fail.
- Be careful with Elytra as it is really easy to smash into the ground or a block, probably killing the player. To be 100% safe, always land in water or hold a Totem of Undying when landing.
- Do not forget that you can pause the game in order to think.
- If it has not yet been patched, when you fall off a cliff, pause and exit your world and then log in to reset the fall counter, thus reducing or negating fall damage.
- Have a water bucket in your hotbar at all times. It may save your life.
- Endermen can be dangerous, so before going into combat with one, build a 2-block-tall roof above you because the enderman is too tall to fit. The same trick works for wither skeletons.
- Never fight mobs in a herd unless you: 1. Have a shield, and 2. There is a creeper in the horde. For some reason you can BLOCK an EXPLOSION, thus killing or damaging all mobs in range. This is risky, but it can be effective.
- In a pinch, when fighting multiple mobs, try to get a skeleton to shoot a different mob. That mob and the skeleton then fight each other, which might allow you to slip away in the confusion.
