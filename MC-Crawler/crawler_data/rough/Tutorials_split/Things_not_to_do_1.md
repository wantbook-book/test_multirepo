## Possible death
The following things not to do in Minecraft could possibly result in the death of the player.

### By the player
#### Hunger and food
Especially during the first days of a new world, the player should avoid wasting their hunger bars. If the hunger bar drops too low, the player cannot naturally regenerate health or sprint (making it difficult to run from dangerous situations). When the hunger bar is completely empty, the player quickly loses health to starvation: Down to 10 health in easy, 1 health in normal, and 0 health in hard.

Some movement, such as sprinting and jumping, drain hunger and saturation much quicker than walking, and are much less efficient per block traveled. Boats and horses can be used to move around quickly without using up any of the player's hunger bar or saturation. The biggest drain on hunger and saturation is natural regeneration of health, so the player can also conserve hunger and food by avoiding taking damage.

Some food sources can give players the Poison or Hunger status effects. If the player needs to eat rotten flesh or raw chicken (which can cause the hunger status effect), they should eat multiple pieces at the same time, so they get more hunger/saturation from the food than they lose through the status effect. The player should avoid eating pufferfish and spider eyes because they cause the poison effect, which would take more hunger/saturation to heal from than these food sources can return. They should also be careful with suspicious stews they found or traded with villagers for. Some types of suspicious stews can give a poison effect. For any of these food options, the player can drink milk to override the status effect, which may make them a more viable food source.

#### Horse armor
If the player owns a horse, finding horse armor for it is advised, because ranged mobs could easily end up killing it while the player either advances or retreats on horseback.

#### Getting lost
After the first few days of work, the player should have some basic facilities for survival (e.g. farms, a shelter, and a mine). Many players are tempted at this point to venture farther from their base to look for resources and explore.

However, the player should always keep in mind the location of their base. Even a brief moment of activity in an unfamiliar place, especially areas with no landmarks, can confuse a player's sense of direction and result in losing the way home. Without knowing where the base is, the player is in danger of losing valuable time and may have to start over most of the game. It is also much easier to die trying to get back, either from starvation or attacks by hostile mobs.

Here are some orientation tips:

- Coordinate notation: Coordinates can be displayed in the game settings without enabling cheats.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]The player can also record their base's coordinates from the Debug screen‌[Java Edition  only](this is done throughF3orFn+F3, depending on BIOS settings). The coordinates are also reported when the player teleports using/teleport @s ~ ~ ~, and also copied to the clipboard in the form of/teleportwhenF3+Cis pressed, if cheats are enabled. A screenshot can be used or writing down, but the coordinates should be kept in a secure place. If the player does not want to write it down in real life or take a screenshot, they can craft a book and quill and write the coordinates of their home down there.
- Lit landmark: Perhaps for smaller distances, one can build tall towers with some torches on the top while traveling, as well as placing one on top of their house. Keep in mind that the towers can be seen only if one's render distance is high enough. A beacon can also be used for this purpose, although a beacon is unobtainable for new players in survival mode. Alternatively, place a torch on the side of a block indicating the direction to the nearest safe haven.
- On grassy earth, mark arrows by digging path squares with a shovel, or use the shovel on grass to make grass path blocks every few paces to mark your way.
- Keeping a running list of important coordinates is recommended.
- Make acompass: Fouriron ingotsand a piece ofredstoneare the ingredients needed to craft a compass. It points toward the world's spawn point, or alodestoneif used on one. The spawn point cannot be changed by sleeping in beds (which changes the individual spawn point), making a compass useful only if the player built their house close to their original spawn or is late enough in the game to have obtained a lodestone. The world spawn can be changed if cheats are enabled by using the/setworldspawncommand.
- If the player has acompassand 8paper, they can craft a map to prevent getting lost. Additionally, a single paper and a compass can be combined in acartography tableto make a map. A zoomed-out map can also be crafted by surrounding a map with 8 paper on a crafting table, or by combining a map with one paper in a cartography table.(Note: InBedrock Edition, the player can choose to start with a map.)
- While traveling, leave a trail of cheap but visible blocks, such aswood planksorcobblestone, every few blocks (torchesalso work). These blocks should not be native to the biome to make them stand out.
- Keep track of navigation directions. Clouds always move slowly from east to west, as do the sun and the moon. Sunflowers also always face east.
- Crafting abook and quillallows the player to take notes. Craft abookwith oneleatherand threepaper, then combine the book with afeatherand anink sacto make a book and quill.

#### Forgetting essentials
When planning to venture far away from their main base, a player should carry wood, a crafting table, building blocks, a pickaxe, plenty of food, a weapon like a sword or axe, some quality armor, a water bucket, a long-ranged weapon such as a bow or trident, and (if using a bow) plenty of arrows unless the bow is enchanted with the Infinity enchantment. Make sure to bring wool for beds to set a new respawn point and sleep when it gets dark. When the player gets a large distance away from the last bed slept in, then it is likely time to use another one. Don't break the bed after sleeping in it, or else the you respawn at the world spawn upon death instead of at the bed's location. If you are going to mine, make sure to bring at least a stack of torches. Even if you aren't mining, torches can also be helpful to mark your way and prevent getting lost.
