## Triggers
The traps here are most notable for their trigger and can be connected to many different mechanisms of harm.

### Trapped ore 1





















Trapped ore. Replace the cobblestone with ore.
When someone mines the ore the TNT will explode! Be sure to place the torches before the TNT and to not place any TNT next to a lit torch.

### Trapped ore 2
Use a piston to push a TNT next to a redstone torch when a block is mined. The advantage of this method is that the trapped block does not need have wires right next to it and that it can cover a wider area.

### Trapped ore 3
For a more expensive but instant explosion, place an observer behind the trapped ore and a dispenser behind the observer with an arrow inside facing away from the observer and place and end crystal where the dispenser is facing. Place the observer before the dispenser and the ore before the observer.

### Redstone mine












The redstone mine. Replace the glowstone with redstone ore.
Instead of a daylight sensor, you can also use an observer. This trap is good because it is hard to detect. If you build this above ground, it may seem somewhat out of place, so you should cover the redstone ore with carpet or build it underground. When the target walks on the redstone, it lights up, triggering the TNT. A similar trap is achieved by putting a valuable block that the player may want to mine in place of the redstone ore. When the player breaks the block, the daylight sensor activates, provided there's a light source or clear air above it.


### Furnace trap


















The furnace trap
Normally people would expect only chests to explode, so this trigger will surprise them as soon as they loot your furnace. You can replace the furnace with any other container for the same effect.

1. Fill afurnacewith coal, iron or food.
2. Put acomparatorleading away from the furnace. It should turn on.
3. Place a block in front of the comparator.
4. Place aredstone torchon the block, it should turn off.
5. Create a redstone line from the torch to TNT.

If a griefer loots the furnace the comparator deactivates and the torch turns on, blowing the victim to bits.

### Minecart mine






























A basic minecart trap
A target riding the minecart triggers the TNT and gets blown up. It might help to disguise the detector as doing something else, like switching tracks, opening a door, etc.

### Wrong lever
Place several levers on a wall and put TNT behind it. Place a sign saying something along the lines of, "Which one...," "Don't pull these!," or "Passcode entry." Eventually a player with too much curiosity may come along and pull a lever.

### Exploding bed
Connect a bed next to a Observer, the Observer to some TNT, and cover the whole thing in cobblestone. Then just wait for the player to sleep in it and get blasted sky-high.

### 




































































You will probably want to put the hooks the other way as they can be seen.
This trap relies on the fact that like end portal, string is invisible from the bottom. Make a room or hallway at least 3 blocks high, and put tripwire in a layer on the third layer up. If the victim jumps, they trigger the trap. However, if the victim sees the tripwire hooks they will probably mine the block so they don't have to jump.

### Chest bomb

















A chest bomb.
1. Place achest.
2. Place ahopperunderneath the chest.
3. Place acomparatorpointing away from the hopper.
4. Place TNT in front of the comparator.

If someone puts something inside the chest, it will go into the hopper, turn on the comparator, and activate the TNT. You could attach the comparator directly to the chest, but it would be more obvious as you can see over chests.
Trapped chests are also an option but they can be seen by experienced players.  Also, they can be seen more easily with resource packs.

### Fishing trap
It is possible to detonate TNT with a pressure plate and a fishing rod. This method is mostly undetectable; however, it is unstable and prone to premature detonation if you don't have patience.

## Lures
These traps' primary feature is the way they lure the target into the trap. Note that none of these lures work on mobs.

### Dropped loot
You could drop items such as gold or diamonds near your trap to increase chances that someone will walk into it. This works best if you know someone is coming by. Some tips:

- It might look too obvious with diamonds, so it could be better to use items like iron bars. You could also try to make it look like someone just died.
- If you want to get elaborate, you could setup adropperto periodically dispense an item. It would probably be possible to detect if the item was picked up, perhaps using aweighted pressure plate.

### Signs
Signs are useful for luring new, and sometimes even experienced, players into a trap. Here are some messages which can be good to lure players into traps.

- "Free Diamonds!" This could be good on a trapped chest, but would only work on newbies.
- "DO NOT ENTER!" Most players would be tempted to do exactly the opposite, even into a possible trap.
- "DO NOT PRESS!" If you see a button, you really want to press it. Especially if there is a sign saying not to.
- "FREE ADMIN!" Like the "free diamonds" example above, this probably works on newbies only.

p/s by troller10000: "DO NOT" means "yes", while "FREE" means "no".
