#### Under the rug
Basically "Under Dirt", but instead with carpet or wool placed on the floor with the chest underneath it. Be careful however, as this method is not as safe as using dirt (or other blocks) as carpet and wool are both fragile.

#### Beneath a lava pool
Hiding a chest beneath a lava pool is a great way to easily access a chest without having to break any blocks, and few players would be smart enough to figure out this trick because of how dangerous lava is. The best way is to find a lava pool or create your own, making sure that it is irregular in shape, so that it doesn't look man-made. If you found one in nature, it's easiest to empty all the lava off it and put everything back in after you put the chests in. Find a part of the hole that is 2 or 3 blocks deep, or just dig down on the parts that are 1 block deep. Place all of your chests in here. Then, pour the lava on top of that. You are done! The only disadvantage of this method is that a player who happens to right-click on the lava pool finds your loot.



#### Five grass blocks and a hoe
Note that this works only with one-block chests.

First, surround your chest with grass blocks (like this):

|  |  |  |
|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Now, put a grass block on top of the chest. This makes the chest inaccessible and invisible. However, if you hoe one of the grass blocks on the side, The grass block becomes farmland. This  makes the block 1 pixel lower, which allows you to carefully locate your crosshair on a tiny hole, making the chest open.

### More complex ways
This section has more complex ways to hide chests, using some redstone.

#### Minecart trick
First of all, you might want to consider trying out the minecart trick. It is simple to build and well hidden. In fact, others can't see it if you cover it up! It involves putting a chest in a minecart and pushing another block into it with a piston. This trick was invented by the youtuber Simply Sarc. First, you dig a hole, and fill it with 3 snow layers. Then, force a minecart with chest to fall in the hole. Now, with pistons, make a tree over the minecart chest. Now, test it- right-click the bottom of your tree. Voila, a chest interface appears.

#### Dungeon protection
Find a dungeon and hide it (Tutorials/Secret door). Attach a redstone lamp to the monster spawner and set up the redstone so that the lamp is on when the door is closed and off when the door is open. This ensures that no mob noises can be heard while a thief is searching, and that the mobs act as guards if the thief finds the dungeon. Hide important items in here.

#### Shell game
Build a room or a house full of trapped chests, all hooked up to deadly traps. You could then memorize the location of the "real" chest, which contains all your goodies and doesn't murder you â€” or you could do like a real shell game, make all of the choices the "wrong" one, and hide your valuables somewhere else entirely. Make sure to surround the chests with wooden pressure plates, so nobody thinks they'll get away with just breaking the chests instead of opening them (as breaking the chest causes all items inside it to drop as items and trigger the pressure plates). Another way to ensure that players don't just break the chests is to put observers observing all the chest blocks, and connect them to a deadly trap. That way, if the chest block is broken, the trap triggers, causing the player trying to steal your stuff to fall into the deadly trap. 

#### Hipster door closet
A "hipster door" (youtube/X3LbkSTjR7I?t=10m3s) is a door that can be disguised as part of the wall and be opened via slime blocks and two sticky pistons. Chests are perfect in this situation because they are non-movable blocks, so they are not pulled down by the slime blocks. (Java edition only)

#### 
For this method of hiding chests, make a room containing the chest with your valuables. Make the chest a trapped chest, and have signs all around it saying things like, "Danger: Opening this chest makes something terrible happen, and running away cannot help! You must find some other way of stealing my valuables! Mwah ha ha ha!" This hopefully convinces players that something terrible would happen if they open the chest. They may run away, but if they're smart they might try to break the chest.

To prevent this from happening, this is where the redstone comes in. Put an observer observing the trapped chest, and connect it to a deadly trap, so if a smarter player tries to break the chest, they experience unpleasant results. The only disadvantage of this method is that if a player decides that they want to open the trapped chest despite the warning signs, they can get all the loot in it without any consequences (this can be remedied by hiding the valuables somewhere else and turning the aforementioned chest into a mere decoy).
