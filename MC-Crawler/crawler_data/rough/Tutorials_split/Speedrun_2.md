## Resetting
Resetting for good seeds in 2020 used to be a massive chore, as you had to manually quit a world, click "Singleplayer", click "Create new world", change the difficulty to easy, and click "Create world". Today, we have developed tools to allow us to instantly reset seeds that we don't like. This is achieved by using a hotkey and a script, so that we can change the difficulty to easy and create a new world extremely quickly.

To do this, you need some mods for this. You need Atum and FastReset (both are Fabric mods and it and all other allowed mods for speedrunning can be found in the official Minecraft Java Speedrunning Discord, or Javacord). You also need the AutoHotKey program, so that the script works for instant resets.

The downloads for all the methods of resetting can be found on Google or Javacord.

### Single Instance
This is the easiest way to start speedrunning. It basically involves running only one instance, and it is easy because it requires the least amount of setup (besides mod downloads). It's therefore much easier to use than multi instance. If you are using Atum (which you should be to get the fast reset to work), you can reset quickly. If you see a world you don't like, you can click on the Save and Quit to Title button in the options menu (which doesn't save and quit to title but instead starts generating a new world), you can use the Atum hotkey to reset the world (default: F6), or you can use an external script to reset the world. Once you feel like ending your session, press ESC, then go to Options, then click  on the button in the bottom left that says Stop Resets and Quit. This sends you to the title screen.

#### Pros
- Easy to set up with no third-party tools and help
- Low system requirements: you are running one instance and it is not as demanding on your computer
- Submitting runs to the speedrun.com/mc leaderboard is extremely straightforward
- You do not need to perform extra setup in OBS to record speedruns

#### Cons
- You have to wait for the world to load before you can join it and play, or reset
- It's easy to get sucked into a bad seed because it takes so much time to find something good (you complete more runs but cannot do them fast)
- Much less efficient

### Multi Instance
Multi instancing somewhat reduces the need to sit through loading screens and allows you to switch between multiple instances at once. It improves your reset efficiency a lot. When you are finished with a world, you can press a hotkey to reset your current instance and switch to the next one.

#### Pros
- Bypasses world loading, which gives you faster reset efficiency
- Customizable CPU load, you can run any number of instances (2-4 is recommended for this method) depending on your hardware
- Less overhead than wall or instance moving

#### Cons
- More CPU intensive than single instance
- More overhead than single instance
- You still have to join a world to see if it's good or not
- More setup required per session (open all instances and run macro)

### The Wall
The Wall is a version a multi instancing which is much more efficient. It takes 6+ instances and displays all of the instances to you at the same time, and it allows you to reset a world without ever having to enter the instance. It also allows you to reset as many instances (even all) as you like and allows you to lock some instances so you can save them while playing others. The number of instances you can use for the wall depends on your hardware.

#### Pros
- Extremely fast reset efficiency
- You can reset multiple or all instances
- You can see the worlds before they finish loading and without entering the instances, which allows you to skip it entirely

#### Cons
- Requires a powerful computer
- Most amount of overhead for the first time
- Takes a good amount of time to set up every session
- With many instances, it is difficult to make sure that all of the instances and the mods are up to date and keep all the settings synced

### Instance Moving
Instance moving is a version of the Wall and the highest level of resetting where you run 9+ instances, resetting them in small groups in a focus grid (most do 4-6 in a group). Instance moving identifies which worlds are done loading (or which one have the most progress) and puts them on your focus grid. It's only marginally faster than generic wall and it's only helpful for top runners or runners using 12 or 15+ instances as it focuses on instances you can play and ignores the ones you can't/

#### Pros
- Slightly faster than base wall if running 9+ instances (to see the best results, use 12-15+ instances)
- Allows you to only focus on instances you can join (quickly)
- Can slightly reduce CPU overhead since you don't reset all instances at once

#### Cons
- Requires more setup
- Not beneficial for less than 9 instances
- Visually and mentally confusing for new runners
- Requires extremely powerful hardware

### Pre 1.9
#### Tower strategy
This strategy is used to gather ender pearls quickly. It is based on the fact that mobs despawn if no player is within 128 blocks and that the player, upon death, is teleported to their spawn point.

First, find a flat area in a desert, then gather some sand, at least 2 and a half stack of leaves, ladders, a chest, a lava bucket, a bed and 12 wooden slab. Then build this structure, sleep in the bed to set your spawn point but leave it immediately.

Layer 142
























Now drop off the tower, stop your fall with the ladders you placed and place all your items in the chest. At last, kill yourself with the lava you placed.
Once you respawn, drop off the tower again and look for endermen, if no one is in sight kill yourself, if you can see one look at it and enter your structure to avoid being hit by the mobs, then take your sword from the chest and kill any enderman you looked at, then place the sword in the chest and kill yourself again. Repeat the process and get all the pearls the endermen dropped.
