### The Nether
Duration: 30 minutesâ€“2 hours

The Nether can be dangerous, so be prepared and try to bring:

- Enchanted Golden Applescan make the first travel to the Nether alotsafer because you probably don't have any Potion of Fire Resistance, and the Apple can provide 5 minutes of fire resistance. Try store at least one in your Overworld exploration to use in your first travel to the Nether, and when inside of a Nether Fortress, use it to help you against the dangerous groups of Blazes, or use it in any emergency, like Ghast attacks. Remember, you can only respawn in Spectator mode.
- At least one piece ofGold Armormust be worn to prevent piglin attacks.
- Gold ingotscan be used to barter with piglins to obtain fire resistance potions and ender pearls, as well as other items.
- Diamond sword,iron armor, andpickaxe. (Iron pickaxes, or better are fine, but they shred netherrackveryfast.),
- Bow(and at least 32 arrows, unless it's enchanted with Infinity). Make sure to enchant everything with 1-skill-point enchantments. It barely costs anything but can make a difference.
- Flint and steel, to relight deactivated portals. If you find yourself without one, they can sometimes be found in a nether Fortress. The best approach is to store one in a chest near the portal.
- At least 16Wood. You can chop downhuge fungifor wood if you are near aCrimson Forestor aWarped Forest.Bonescan also be brought to these locations to makeBone Meal, both for growing huge fungi and generating additional fungi. However, starting a wood farm outside of the respective biomes requireSilk Touch, as fungi grow only on the matchingnyliumtype.
- If you arenotnear a crimson or warped forest, you can bring somebones,dirt, andsaplings. This way, a tree farm can be started (ideally in a protected location, as trees are flammable). Making a wood farm this way is also easier, as it eliminates the need for both Silk Touch andbone meal, although the latter can still be used to make the trees grow faster. If you run out of bone meal, you can killwither skeletonsfor their bones, but this is highly risky and not recommended as it requires finding anether fortress, and you are likely to faceblazesin doing so.
- Anyiron ingots,coalandfood(Remember, you could only respawn inSpectatormode.)
- A stack or two ofcobblestoneas an emergency blocking material. Ghasts can't destroy cobblestone.
- A stack or two of sand or gravel might be handy for climbing down sheer drops. Be careful: getting shot off the top of a pile while descending is usually fatal.
- Acauldron, because you can actually place water in cauldrons, so if you accidentally set yourself on fire, you can quickly extinguish yourself by jumping into the cauldron.
- Abowl, to makemushroom stew, which is highly recommended due to being the only secure food source in the Nether. It can mainly save you fromstarvingbecause it'sveryuseful if you couldn't find your portal anymore.

Some dangerous aspects of the Nether are:

- Ghasts. Their fireballs can seriously damage unprepared players, or deactivate portals. Without a flint and steel or fire charges, another fireball must hit the portal to reactivate it.
- Falling down huge distances. Even while moving carefully, an explosion can easily destroy the terrain, which may expose a lethally high drop onto blocks or even into lava. Fall damage is one of the leading causes of death in the Nether.
- Lava. There are many little pockets of lava inside the netherrack, in addition to the lava seas. Lava is much more dangerous in the Nether because its flow is faster and flows farther. Since water cannot be placed in the Nether, potions of fire resistance areveryuseful.
- The "Basalt Deltas" biome. Avoid these where possible. The jagged terrain, frequent hidden holes of lava with no escape, and the abundance of Magma Cubes, make this biome exceptionally dangerous unless you are prepared with Fire Resistance. Even mining in this biome is dangerous due to the hidden lava. Far too many Hardcore runs have ended in this biome.
- Piglins. An attacked piglin or zombified piglin attracts others and they can come at you in droves. You may get overwhelmed, even with good gear.
- Beware of thePiglin Brute. Although they only spawn in aBastion Remnant, they are extremely powerful with 50 health and 19 damage, enough for killing the player without any status effects in a maximum of nine hits when player is stuck (even with Protection netherite armor). They are always hostile, their attacks disable shields, and they make regular piglins attack you too.
- Blazes. Although they're not challenging alone and in controlled circumstances, in groups of three or more they may present a significant challenge. An unexpected attack of just one blaze can be lethal.
- Endermen. Although they are rare, they can be dangerous when provoked due to their teleporting ability and high health, especially when they are accompanied by ablazeor awither skeleton. They are particularly dangerous in the Nether where you can't use water to counter them.
- Wither skeletons. Although they only appear in nether fortresses, this may be the most lethal Nether mob; they are fast, strong, and inflict the wither status effect.

The Nether contains four things that might be crucial for your adventure:

- Nether wart: they are necessary to brew any usefulpotion. They are found quite often in nether fortresses. Five is enough, but it's better to take every one. Collect at least six blocks of soul sand, so that a farm can be started.
- Blaze Rod: it is necessary to crafteyes of ender. It is also used to craft abrewing standand brew strength and fire resistance potions. To obtain them you need to kill blazes. It's best to fight loneblazesat first to avoid becoming overwhelmed. Find two rods (one if you already havemagma cream); once you have those (and your Nether Wart), retreat to brew some potions of fire resistance. Collect more rods after applying the fire resistance potions, but remember that potions of fire resistance doNOTnullify Blaze melee attacks. For the main Blaze battle, find an enclosedspawnerand kill them with a sword. This conserves arrows and saves the drops. About 12 blaze rods should be more than enough.
- Ghast tears: used for potions of regeneration. However, ghasts are dangerous, and their drops are often destroyed.
- Glowstone dust: used for strengthening potion effects.Glowstoneappears occasionally in nether fortresses, otherwise, look for it on low ceilings of netherrack. Besides, it allows you to create spectral arrows, the effect is just a visual help, but making them doubles your arrows in exchange for glowstone dust. Keep in mind that spectral arrows are consumed even if the bow is enchanted withInfinity.
- Ender pearls: if you managed to get a sword with Looting III on it, you can gather ender pearls quickly. Find a warped forest (the only biome in the Nether where only endermen spawn in abundance), then hit them or look at them to get them angry and follow you. You can either dig into a wall where the endermen can't reach you or trap the endermen in a boat, then critical hit the endermen until they die. You may earn between 0 and 4 pearls per kill. Try to leave the Nether with 16-32 ender pearls.

Nether Survival: If there are no nether fortresses nearby, you may be forced to spend a lot of time in the Nether. Food supplies can be easily replenished, using abundant mushrooms, or killing hoglins which drop porkchops. Use torches or distinctive nonflammable blocks, like cobblestone, dirt or crafting tables to mark the path back to the portal. 

First find a fortress. Gather the blaze rods that you need, then head off to find a warped forest to kill endermen and get your pearls.

Try to avoid bastion remnants. It may sound like a good idea to trade with piglins in a bastion remnant (although you need gold armor), as there are plenty of them and there is tons of gold to be found. However, after version 1.16.1, piglin brutes spawn in every bastion and pearl luck is severely nerfed. Treasure bastions are especially dangerous due to the high amounts of lava and magma cube spawner, and stables bastions due to the high concentration of hoglins. If you do decide to head to a bastion remnant, be careful about mining the gold or opening chests around them, as they become angry and try to kill you, and watch out for piglin brutes. If you decide to not risk it, head to a warped forest and kill endermen.

After getting all the ender pearls you need, relocate your nether portal and return to the Overworld.
