## Properties
Skins are divided into areas that act as the surface area of the character (for example, the front head area, left leg area, etc.). There are a total of 3,264 pixels that can be customized, with 1,632 on each layer. Skins with slim arms have 3,136 pixels, with 1568 pixels on each layer. The second layer can be used to give the character glasses, hats, or other accessories (even a bigger head).

In Java Edition, a skin allows only a solid color; transparency is not allowed on the skin file except on the second layer, which is transparent by default; playing offline, pixels can be left free resulting in "holes" in the skin. If a skin with transparent pixels on the first layer is uploaded, the transparent pixels render as black pixels in-game.

In Bedrock Edition, skins can have double the resolution of a normal skin. This means the skin template can be up to 128×128 instead of just 64×64. The normal templates still apply, but players get 4× the amount of pixels to work with, since both dimensions have been doubled. Transparency can be used, even on the first layer, though there needs to be at least one visible pixel, so a fully invisible skin can't be made. The transparency must also be 0% or 100% as translucent colors are not allowed in either layer.

Pixel size of the 2nd layer on body, arms and legs is 0.25 pixel bigger than the skin pixel (inner layer).
For head 2nd layer (Hat layer) it is 0.5 pixels bigger than the skin layer (inner layer).

## World textures
Main article: Resource pack
A skin can also refer to other textures in the game, such as block textures, item sprites, mob skins, etc. A list of these can be found here.

It is worth noting that a zombie and its variants can use typical player skins (and vice-versa). Skeleton mobs can use typical player skins as well, but keep in mind that they have their skinny arms and legs. If a skeleton mob skin is used as a player's skin, their legs and arms do not appear skinny.

In order to use the player skin for zombies, the user must align it to the correct place on the .png to avoid a visual break in the texture.

## Changing or installing player skins
### Java Edition

Only players who have purchased Minecraft can change their character's skin. This is done on the profile page or in the Minecraft Launcher by uploading a valid .png texture that is 64×64 pixels, or a legacy texture that is 64×32 pixels, which then replaces the default skin.
- What the Minecraft websites profile page looks like.
- What the Change Skin page on the Minecraft website looks like.
- What the Minecraft Launchers Skin Tab looks like.
- What it looks like to add a new skin in the Minecraft Launcher.

Skins also have the option of having either 3 or 4 pixel wide arms, which can be changed on the profile page as well.[1]

The steve.png and alex.png files in client.jar can also be changed and replaced via a resource pack, but the effects are visible only to players using the resource pack, and affects all players with the default skin.
