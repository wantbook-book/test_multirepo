### Grinder
A manual cave spider grinder.

There are two types of grinders for any type of mob farm: a manual grinder and an automatic grinder. For a manual grinder, the player kills the mobs, and for an automatic, some other source of damage kills the mobs. For cave spiders, a manual grinder is cheaper and more efficient than an automatic, but requires the player to be there to kill the cave spiders.

#### Manual grinder
Because of their size, ability to hold breath underwater, and ability to climb walls; water and fall damage is difficult to make effective on caves spiders. Cactus isn't very effective either, as cave spiders are small enough to fit in between two cacti without taking damage. That said, a cave spider can fall a maximum of 16 blocks before dying. The only ways to kill them automatically are magma blocks and iron golems. The easiest way to make a cave spider farm is to use a manual grinder.

Manual grinders require a hole that is too narrow for cave spiders, but large enough to allow players to attack them easily. One simple way of making one is by placing two fence posts next to a closed door:

#### Automatic grinder
One of the few ways to kill cave spiders without the player's aid is by placing iron golems in the collection chamber of the cave spiders. Place hoppers along the floor, all eventually connecting to a double chest. The iron golems will kill the cave spiders, and the loot will fall into the hoppers and go into the chest.

The disadvantage of using this method is that cave spiders will damage the iron golems as well, and eventually the iron golems will be killed. It is recommended to have an iron golem farm before trying to attempt this farm (otherwise, you will go through a lot of iron!). This can be mitigated by having the cave spiders land on magma blocks. You can also repair the iron golem by using iron ingots.

Another way is to make a 9Ã—9 plus 4 air blocks under the spawner and one on it. On the floor put magma, and in the upper corners, water. It will push the spiders in the middle. Under the magma block put minecart hopper, and under it a normal hopper which leads to a chest. The storage is expandable. The only thing you have to do is stay at the level of the spawner, right next to the farm.

An automatic grinder which uses a campfire.
Another way is to use flowing water to funnel the cave spiders onto a campfire with a block directly above it. The cave spiders can fit in the half-block gap between the campfire and the block and will take damage from occupying the same block as the campfire, and a hopper can be placed underneath. A soul campfire will deal twice as much damage as a regular one.

### Final Touches
Once your grinder, whether it's automatic or manual, is fully functional, go back to the spawner room and get rid of all of the lighting that you put up. This should allow the cave spiders to spawn. If desired, you can decorate any part of the farm that may be in view of a player. Also, if you want to enhance the mechanics of a farm, make a sorter (this will only work if you have hoppers underneath your grinder). This way, the string and spider eyes dropped from the cave spiders will go into separate chests.

Now you have finished your cave spider farm, which will supply you of endless string and spider eyes. However, note that in order for cave spiders to spawn, you must be close to the spawner.
