# Tutorials/Half hearted hardcore
Half Hearted Hardcore, or half a heart hardcore, is self-explanatory. It is a custom difficulty which has all the hardcore and ultra hardcore restrictions, but you are stuck on half a heart and cannot regenerate at all. If you take any damage from anything, from a boss mob to a llama, you will die and lose your world forever.

This difficulty is only for the best of the best players and you need to have definitely had a massive amount of experience on Ultra Hardcore, as well as the normal hardcore. You also need to bear in mind that even if you do meet these requirements, you need to accept the fact that it is extremely easy to lose your world, even if you have the strongest armor and buffs possible. All of the rules for hardcore and ultra hardcore still apply, so read them first.

## Setting up the world
{{{1}}}
Creating a Half Hearted Hardcore (HHH) world requires cheat permissions, which are impossible to enable when creating a new hardcore world. To work around this, you can create a normal hardcore world, and then open it to LAN with cheats enabled.

1. On the new world screen, set the game mode to Hardcore. Then, inside the game rules menu, toggle 'Regenerate Health' to 'OFF'.
2. After creating the world, pause the game and click 'Open to LAN'.
3. Toggle 'Allow Cheats' to 'ON', then press 'Start LAN World'.
4. Type '/attribute @p minecraft:generic.max_health base set 1'. This will set your maximum health to 1 point, or half a heart.
5. To disable cheats, simply save the world and quit to title. When you next open your world, you will only have a half of a heart, and the challenge begins.

## Notes and tips
HHH is nearly impossible to survive when playing, and if you take any damage, you die, and you can only spectate the world. Therefore, it's important to know how NOT to take damage. Here are some tips:

- First of all, as stated before, you cannot take damage. So remember to avoid every single way possible of taking damage, albeit how trivial, such as being stung by apufferfishor being spat on by allama.
- Gravitate towards open areas. If you stay in the open, you will be able to recognize any potential dangers long before they become immediately threatening. It only takes one skeleton hiding behind a tree in a forest to end your world forever.
- Get as much food as soon as you can. Kill every animal mob you come across on your first day, apart from sheep which you should shear. Try to save 2 of each animal and make an animal farm as soon as you can.
- Sleep through every night as soon as possible. Keep a bed with you at all times so that you are never caught unprepared when dusk arrives. Any hostile mob that happens to spawn could very quickly bring your world to an untimely end.
- As soon as you get enough iron, make a shield and keep it in your off-hand slot. It blocks damage from most mobs, including creepers and blazes.
- When you get a water bucket, keep it in your hotbar in your inventory and never remove it, as it will save your life. (Make sure you learn how to use it.) If you get apowder snowbucket, replace that with the former, since you can MLG with it inthe Netheras well as the other two dimensions.
- When you get agolden apple, keep that in your hotbar as well and never remove it either, as, again, the absorption hearts will save you one day. If you are lucky enough to find anEnchanted Golden Apple, keep that in your hotbar as well.
- If you manage to find a woodland mansion, wear at least full max-durability iron armor, a shield and bring a diamond sword, and then raid it. Pillar up and kill vindicators to prevent their axes disabling your shield. Evoker fangs can be counteracted by swimming in the top of water 2 blocks high, and remember that the fangs will most of the time only appear where you were when the evoker was starting the spell. Make sure you kill evokers before they summon vexes, but if they do, run out of the evoker's hostile range and block the vexes with shields until they start to die. Once you get a totem of undying, move the shield to your hotbar and keep the totem in your offhand, because it will save your life. You can keep switching between the shield and totem, but be very careful. If you can, try to use the shield in your main hand and attack enemies staying crouched with the shield.
- If you manage to get a beacon, put it somewhere near your base of operations and make it Resistance 2 unless you already have one which gives you that effect. Resistance 2 will make any hits on you do less damage.
- If you are in the End, bring a water bucket, even if you have powder snow, because it will stop endermen from getting close to you, it will damage shulkers, and it will help you get up pillars and end cities.
- If you afk, make sure you use an AFK pool that is compatible for boats so you will not lose hunger. Enclose the box fully and make sure there are solid blocks over your head to prevent phantoms from spawning and lightning strikes from hitting you.
- DO NOT use an ender pearl unless you are in a life threatening situation (e.g. falling into lava) and make sure you have at least enchanted diamond armor to reduce the damage to a non-fatal amount.
