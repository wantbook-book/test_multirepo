## Defense on the Move
If stuck out on an expedition, always bring a torch. 

By quickly digging 3×3×3 cube into the ground, jumping in, and covering the top layer you've created a little burrow.
Add a torch and a bed and you've got a very quick home.

A variation uses the giant mushrooms. All you need is dirt, bonemeal and a mushroom and you can grow a pretty good shelter near instantly. Bring some blocks to fill out gaps (You should always carry some anyway) and maybe some ladders. Fill with bed and torches, and your home is finished.

Another option is to simply build a 1×2 wall around a space of any desired size, and add some torches and a bed. This is another way to have an instant, quick shelter. However, if you want visibility and have slabs with you, there is a variation. Make the wall, but only 1×1, and add slabs on top of the wall.

If you happen to be stuck in a dense forest and cannot make a wall shelter or hole easily, here are some tips on how to make a shelter. Either pillar jump or use ladders to get to the top of a tree. Then, make a platform on top of the tree. You can add walls if you don't have a bed, although it is recommended to have a bed. Once the platform is made, add torches (or a bed) and either wait or sleep the night away.

1. Armor, even leather armor, is very helpful for defense and could potentially save a player's life. If you are going to hunt forender pearls, looking forstrongholdsor undergroundmines, or just going for a nighttime stroll, armor will be very handy.
2. Always haveswordwith you, as a sword is your main source of offense. It's strongly recommended to have at least 2 swords, and swords can break fairly quickly.
3. In the Nether, it is useful to carry a bow and a stack of arrows to defend yourself fromghasts. Additionally, snowballs will deal 3points of damage toblazes, making snowballs and snow golems useful in theNether, assuming you kept thesnow golemalive usingsplash potionsofFire Resistance.
4. Make a hole on one side of your house that is 2 high and 1 wide. Leave the top block open, and for the bottom block, place adispenserfacing outwards, stacked witharrows. Place apressure platedirectly in front of the dispenser, so that you can stand at your window at night, draw a monster's attention, and lure it onto the pressure plate. This will activate the dispenser and effectively kill the offending mob. One will regularly findrotten flesh,bonesandarrowsunderneath. The arrows can be used to replenish your dispenser. Make sure your pressure plate is made ofstone, because otherwise, the drops of the dead mobs will keep activating the plate, causing the plate to be disabled for 5 minutes after every use, or until theplayerpicks the items up.
5. Though many players like to usegoldfor its color and value, it is inadvisable to use gold in armor. It is only a little bit better than leather and is expensive to acquire. It's much more efficient to use iron.
6. Placing a door from the outside is reliable for killingmobsat yourdoor, such as zombie sieges. You can attack mobs from the outside without breaking or opening the door. However, if the door is placed from the inside, you will only open the door, instead of attacking mobs outside.[verify]
7. If you have diamond armor, wear it when you are fighting other players. This is because other players are just as good as you, and you need to be prepared.

## Innovative Defenses
These defense tactics are usually only used to impress others in multiplayer, but may also be used as an overly expensive way to secure a shelter. 

### Trapdoor Floating Island

  

This article needs cleanup to comply with the style guide. [discuss]
Please help improve this page. The talk page may contain suggestions.Reason: section


On the surface, where you enter looks like a 5×5×4 block high house that floats, but on the inside, basically your main house is above the surface, your ditch would be one block out but 3 blocks down so that the basement of your float monstrosity can be a mob farm. It is 5×5 as spiders can jump, so you have 8 opportunities to escape from the spiders and have murder hole on the higher level to kill those spiders.

### Trapdoor Drawbridge
This is a bridge that can be toggled to let the player in and to keep hostiles out. You will need a standard ditch or moat, a half stack or so of any opaque block, and enough trapdoors to cross over your ditch twice. The blocks should be placed like so:

T=trapdoorB=opaque block
A=air
Layer 1
BBBBTTTTTTTTBBBB
Layers 2 and 3
BBBB
AAAA

It's optional to add an overhang to defend from spiders. Also, to prevent mobs from walking on the side of the trapdoors, place blocks like fences or glass panes. This will make sure that the mobs go through the middle.

### Jumping Puzzle Entrance
For people who do rather well with jumping puzzles, implement a course that leads to your door. Mobs can't solve jumping puzzles, so your house is safe.

### Floating Island
Make a floating island house and parkour on from a nearby mountain. This is highly inconvenient, but almost completely immune to mob invasion. You must also make a separate shelter for a mine.

### Fire Mine
Place a dispenser facing upwards in the ground. Place a pressure plate on the outside edge of the dispenser. Put a flint and steel in the dispenser. Now, when something tries to walk past it, they will trigger the pressure plate. This will cause the dispenser to use the flint and steel, lighting the entity walking past it on fire. The fire will go out shortly, but it will cause massive damage to most mobs.

This defense is best used as a ring around an area you want to defend. Anything steps on the line of pressure plates and it goes up in flames.
