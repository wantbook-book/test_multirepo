## Booster types
### Two-way corner manual-reset
This example demonstrates a two-way manual reset booster. The booster only requires a manual reset should you want to go the same direction twice. It is an excellent solution for those who prefer to have minimal alterations made to their terrain.



### One-way up-downhill manual-reset
This allows you to boost minecarts up or down a hill. Note that you must already be moving to reach the booster while travelling uphill.



### 
These are two possible configurations for one-way resetting boosters based on the south-west rule. The one on the left is a south→north booster, and the one on the right is a west→east booster. 



### 
This booster uses a raised auto-reset loop, so that it can be built in any direction. The booster minecart will go through the loop and fall onto the inclined track, going back to the starting position.





### 
This booster is just like the previous booster but only requires three tracks for the auto-reset loop. It takes a couple more steps. 



First build the tracks like this. In order to bend the third track around so that it resets, you need to add a block above the track like this.



Then place a track on top of the block. That will bend the third track into its proper placement. 



The last step is to remove the block.



### 
This booster uses a simple loop that throws the cart back onto the track, since the track is angled it hops onto the track and continues in a straight line, ignoring the S-W rule that applies when running into perpendicular tracks.



### Two-way auto-reset
Here is an example of a two-way resetting booster that is direction-independent (its cardinal direction doesn't matter):

### Two-way corner auto-reset
An example of a  two-way booster for corners that auto-resets.



### Two-way auto-reset compact design
Here is an example of a two-way resetting booster that is direction-independent. This design is a little more compact. 



### Two-way auto-reset efficient design
Here is yet another two-way gravity powered auto-reseting booster. The lower cart pictured (the booster) sits in the center of a symmetrical section of track, and will always come to rest at that point. This may be the most efficient when it comes to amount of iron that is needed to make it. This design was made by alfadark on Reddit.

It should be noted that this design requires time to settle after each use and it may only propel users a few blocks. This design should not be used on heavily used tracks or on multi-player.



### Uphill auto-reset booster
This is a simple, compact and effective way of going uphill.  It won't boost you downhill, but gravity will handle things for you there.



1. This is your main track. You want to build a booster here.
2. Dig a 2×2×1 hole containing your main track.
3. Rebuild the two pieces your main track inside the hole (like a "V" letter). Then, start building a booster track.
4. At the top end of the booster track...
5. ...remove the last track piece...
6. ...and put a block there. This way, the booster minecart will hit that block and go back down to the starting position.
7. Your finished track.

An other version, only to extend the distance your minecart is able to cover.



### Booster in turns
There are two ways to make your booster keep working even if you need to make a turn. Follow the picture below to make one, but there are two restrictions on its usage:

- It cannot make more than a single turn. If you need to circle something while going up, you will need to use many separate boosters.
- After the turn, it must boost you for at least 6 more blocks, else it won't have speed to reset.



The second way to still have a booster work after a turn:
unlike the one above this one will work for any number of turns.
It is 5×5×4 and uses only 16 pieces of track.



### Auto-Start booster
Getting a minecart going initially can be tricky and requires good timing to place the cart, push off, and jump in. This setup simplifies the process by giving the cart a boost from a dead stop. This is a useful configuration to have at stations in a minecart network.

The outer loop cart, once started, is repeatedly boosted by the inner cart, which simply travels back and forth along its short track. The outer loop cart in turn can be used to boost a stationary cart placed next to the corners. Just wait for the outer loop cart to pass, place your cart, get in, and when the outer loop cart loops around again your cart will get a boost.

Unfortunately, the loop cart can bug out after a while, which while easily fixed, is still annoying.



The following design of an auto-start holding station attempts to rectify the infinite loop bug encountered in the above design.  Place carts 1 and 3 in their initial positions as shown, then drop cart 2 into its initial position from above to start the perpetual motion.

Cart 1 is a simple uphill booster used to force cart 2 back to its initial position.  Cart 2 actually drives the rider's cart (cart 3).  Point 4 is a position for a switch that will allow cart 3 to exit the loop.  The rider can then enter at any point after point 4.  Point 5 shows the return track for Cart 3.  The rider can exit at any time before point 5 or after point 4 safely (cart 3 will likely go around its full track again, so this design is inefficient for long tracks).

After cart 3 has left the holding station, cart 2 will always move just far enough from its initial position to reach cart 1, boosting it uphill.  Both return to their initial positions, stopping each iteration, allowing for perpetual motion without infinite momentum.
