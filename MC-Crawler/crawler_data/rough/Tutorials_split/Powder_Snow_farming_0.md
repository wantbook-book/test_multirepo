# Tutorials/Powder Snow farming
Powder Snow farming is the renewable obtaining of powder snow, a block useful for traps and technical purposes. Powder snow only naturally generates in grove and snowy slopes biomes, which are a bit hard to come by. If the player cannot find these biomes, they have a renewable option to obtain powder snow: from cauldrons placed in cold biomes under open sky, in which powder snow accumulates during snowfall.

## A few key points
- Unlike ice, powder snow accumulates only when it is snowing; it will not accumulate during clear weather.
- Like ice, powder snow accumulates in any biome cold enough to snow. Therefore, a good idea is to build a powder snow farm next to anice farm, so that both of these climate-dependent blocks can be farmed at once.
- Some of the biomes do not snow on the surface, but they snow at higheraltitudes. These biomes include the commonplacetaigaandstony shore, the rareold growth taigaandwindswept hills, as well as all of their variants.Frozen oceans only snow at sea level in certain local regions, where there is normalicecovering the surface.
	- This means that, if the player is going to stay in or close to a snowy or cold biome for a while, then a good option is to just set up the powder snow farm (as well as an ice farm) there. For a cold biome listed above, build a platform at higher altitudes where it is cold enough to snow, and place your cauldrons there. Powder snow will accumulate as long as thehorizontaldistance between it and the player is less than 128 blocks, so having a farm higher up won't affect its rates.

## Manual farming
First of all, you will need to find a place where it snows, as mentioned above. Place as many cauldrons as desired. Make sure there are no solid blocks over the cauldrons. In Bedrock Edition, powder snow accumulates much faster than it does in Java Edition, so you will need fewer cauldrons. Now AFK until it has been snowing for a while, and once the snow level in the cauldrons reach the top, you can harvest it using buckets.
