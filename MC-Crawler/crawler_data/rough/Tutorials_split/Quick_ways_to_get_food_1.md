### Looting Shipwrecks
You can often find shipwrecks  in any ocean- or beach-type biome.  If the "bow" (front) of the ship is present, the "supply" chest within can have a decent amount of food, or at least wheat to make bread.  The list of food items that can be found in shipwrecks:

| Item             | Stack Size | Chance | Average | Place        | Restored Hunger After Eating Food | Effects                                      |
|------------------|------------|--------|---------|--------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Suspicious Stew  | 1          | 57.4%  | 0.774   | Supply Chest | 6 ()                              | Suspicious Stew/Effects                      |
| Carrot           | 4-8        | 42.1%  | 3.250   | Supply Chest | 3 ()                              | No                                           |
| Poisonous Potato | 2-6        | 42.1%  | 2.167   | Supply Chest | 2 ()                              | Have 60% chance to givePoisonfor 5 seconds.  |
| Potato           | 2-6        | 42.1%  | 2.167   | Supply Chest | 1 ()                              | No                                           |
| Rotten Flesh     | 5-24       | 32.2%  | 5.610   | Supply Chest | 4 ()                              | Have 80% chance to giveHungerfor 30 seconds. |

Note that each suspicious stew will have one of six random effects; most of these will pass within a few seconds, and are only an issue if you're currently in a fight.  But there are equal chances of getting poison (which can do up to 4 damage), or saturation (bonus food, effectively maxing out your food gauges).

| Item  | Stack Size | Chance | Average | Place        | Food That can be Crafted From Item | Restored Hunger After Eating Food |
|-------|------------|--------|---------|--------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Wheat | 8-21       | 44.9%  | 4.390   | Supply Chest | Bread                              | 5 ()                              |

### Foraging

There are several food items that can be gathered from the landscape with varying degrees of ease.  Which of these are available will depend on the biomes you pass through.  Note that except for mushroom stew, these are not very good foods, filling your hunger bar but offering little saturation to back it up.  That said, they'll keep you from starvation until you can find something better.

#### Mushroom Stew
Brown and red mushrooms can be found in various places throughout the world, mostly under trees or in caves.  They are also common in the Nether.  A bit of wood allows you to craft bowls, and with a bowl and both mushroom types, you can easily craft mushroom stew, without even needing a crafting table.   If you happen to be in the rare mushroom fields, you can also get mushroom stew by "milking" a mooshroom with an empty bowl, though the mushrooms themselves will also be plentiful.  (In the mushroom fields, the wood for a bowl might be the hardest to find!)  This is one of the best foraged foods, with value comparable to some cooked meats.  Its main drawback is that once crafted, it is unstackable.   However, the ingredients are stackable, and three slots will hold the makings for 64 bowls of stew.  Note that you do get the bowl back when you eat the stew, so it's perfectly reasonable to carry a large amount of each mushroom type, and a batch of 4 bowls to fill as needed. 

##### Suspicious Stew

Adding a flower to the mushroom-stew recipe will instead produce suspicious stew, which is just as nourishing and also grants a brief status effect.  It matters a lot which flower you use, as some of them produce bad effects:

- A dandelion or blue orchid will give the "saturation" effect, promoting your stew to a superfood!
- An oxeye daisy will let you regenerate a few points of health, while a lily-of-the-valley will poison you, doing several points of damage.
- Other flowers offer various good or bad effects, but all lasting just a few seconds.

#### Sweet Berries
Spawning in/near a taiga biome allows you to get early access to sweet berries, which are a weak but plentiful food source and easy to farm.  However, the bushes can be hazardous -- avoid walking through them.

#### 
When cutting down oak or dark oak trees, a few of the leaves (1 in 200 of the blocks) will drop apples as they decay.  You can also manually break the leaf blocks.

#### Melons
In jungles, you can likely find melon blocks, which can be broken into melon slices.  These are a weak food, but can be plentiful, especially since unused slices can be crafted into seeds to (eventually) grow more melons.

#### Pumpkin Pie
If you happen to have the ingredients, pumpkin pie is a relatively cheap and filling food item, crafted with only one pumpkin, sugar (from sugar cane), and an egg.  All of these can be farmed in mass quantities. One thing troublesome is finding the pumpkins in the first place, but once that's done, there are no real challenges. They can also be crafted without a crafting table, requiring only three ingredients.

#### Rotten Flesh
Rotten flesh is one of the most common and least-valued items in the game. Most often found after killing zombies and their various relatives (or waiting for them to burn in the morning), it can also show up chest loot.  It is a bottom-tier food, which furthermore has an 80% chance to inflict "food poisoning" â€“ 30 seconds of the Hunger effect. However, that duration doesn't accumulate, and it doesn't cost all that much hunger. So, if you eat several pieces at once, you can fill up your hunger gauge, perhaps heal a bit, and only lose a little saturation "off the top". Drinking milk right after eating rotten flesh will also cancel the effect.
