#### Attacking villagers
A player's popularity in a village determines the prices that villagers offer when trading. The lower the player's popularity, the higher the price. Attacking (or even accidentally hitting) a villager causes the player to lose 1 popularity (see Village). Killing one results in a loss of 2 popularity, which is not worth anything to the player as villagers drop nothing. Attacking a baby villager results in the player losing 3 popularity and killing a baby villager results in the player losing 5 popularity. In bedrock edition, if the player kills the village's iron golem, the player loses 10 popularity.

In Bedrock Edition, the reputation system works differently. Just attacking a villager provokes the iron golem. Getting out of range helps because iron golems have a short memory. Dying also pacifies the iron golem. In Bedrock Edition, prices do not depend on reputation; they depend on the villager's demand for certain items.

If the player's popularity is -15 or lower, any naturally spawned iron golems attack the player without being provoked. Also, the village popularity does not reset when the player gets killed and the only way the player can get their popularity back up is to trade with villagers. So the player should only attack villagers or iron golems in special circumstances. If a villager or iron golem must be killed for some reason, the player should contrive to use natural damage such as fire, lava, or dispensed TNT. Iron golems do drop iron ingots upon death. The player can also build an iron golem farm specifically to collect iron ingots. Remember, villagers are the player's friends, not their foes!

#### Spending the night near villages without sleeping
In Java Edition, if the player is in a village at midnight, there is a 10% chance that a zombie siege could begin. Dozens of zombies spawn regardless of how well-lit or walled-off the village is. A few good sieges can easily wipe out the player's local village, and it is extremely tedious to try to repopulate it with zombie villagers. Staying out of the village boundary is sufficient to prevent zombie sieges from occurring, but it is still advised to stay farther away from the village, in order to prevent random zombie spawns.

#### Attacking wolves
Remember that wolves can also be allied with the player. If the player attacks them, all the wolves around get angry also, and when wolves are angry, they cannot be tamed, similar to zombified piglins. Also, wolves do not despawn on Peaceful mode, but they damage the player in Bedrock Edition and do not damage the player in Java Edition and the Console edition on Peaceful mode. Also, wolves do not drop anything, so there is almost no use in killing wolves; it is much better of an idea to tame them instead.

If you cannot find a bone, leash the wolf and bring it back to your base and feed it some bones.

#### Polar bears with cubs
Polar bears are neutral mobs, but they can deal up to 9 damage per hit on Hard mode, and are also incredibly easy to provoke. An adult polar bear which is with a polar bear cub attacks the player without being provoked.

#### Not throwing potions far enough
If the player does not throw a splash potion with a negative effect far enough, they become affected by the potion. The player may then be adversely affected. Therefore, the player should make sure that if they are throwing a splash potion at an enemy, they should throw it far so that they do not get affected by their own potion.

#### Creepers in water
Creepers submerged in water cannot destroy blocks and structures by exploding, but the slowing effects of the water make it especially tricky to kill them effectively. Unless the player wants to make it explode to get rid of it quickly without affecting the terrain, the player should use a trident or bow instead of a melee weapon to kill a creeper submerged in water. Ideally, the trident should have Loyalty to allow the player to throw the trident without having to swim to retrieve it.

#### Not carrying carved pumpkins to the ender dragon fight
As the carved pumpkin severely impairs the player's vision, it may not be a good idea to wear it and fight the dragon head-on, even if it prevents endermen from attacking the player. However, if the player uses a resource pack, third-person view, or removes the GUI to remove the impaired view of the carved pumpkin, the player can see the entire screen, and endermen cannot become provoked by the player looking at them. If the player would rather use a diamond helmet and they are confident they can keep their crosshair away from the endermen, using a diamond or netherite helmet might be a better idea.
On a Peaceful level of difficulty, this is not necessary.

#### Not keeping an eye on the ground
If the player does not watch for hazards at their feet while moving, they might fall off into a ravine, lava lake, or a patch of mobs, or instead, fall off a mountain. Keep an eye on the ground while moving (Even if it is pressing F5 twice to change the camera view).

#### Standing next to blocks while mining
This is not quite so obvious, but if the player mines the blocks directly in front of them while being close to the block, several negative things could happen. The player could walk into a ravine, walk straight into a monster spawner, or even worse, have lava flow onto them. The player should use ambiance noise to their advantage. If the player hears mobs, lava, or water, they should proceed with caution. Subtitles may be used to highlight such sounds if the player cannot turn the game volume up high. One possible mining technique to fix this may be mining two blocks forward at eye level, then digging out for feet. Do this twice and almost all chances of lava or water flowing in can be noticed before they harm you.
