### Overkill

Goal: Deal 9 hearts of damage in one hit.

Enchant a sword with Bane of Arthropods, Smite, or Sharpness with a level high enough to deal together with the sword's base damage at least 18 × 9 in one hit to a mob/player. Alternatively, enchant trident with Impaling. Potions of strength will count as increased damage so strength will make this achievement easier. The netherite sword is the easiest.



### Into the Nether

Goal: Create a Nether Portal

Collect at least 10 obsidian with a diamond or netherite pickaxe and build a nether portal. If you cannot get obsidian in item form, create a mold and pour water next to lava source blocks (more details can be found in Tutorials/Nether survival). Light the nether portal with flint and steel.

Place your obsidian blocks like so, upright. The cobblestone can be replaced with obsidian, or any other block (including air).

You can make nether portals up to 23×23, but it is not recommended as it requires a lot of obsidian.



### Return to Sender

Goal: Kill a ghast with a fireball.

Aim at the ghast then punch the fireball when it is close enough to you to deflect it. If you can perfectly aim, a shot arrow or fishing rod bobber may hit the fireball and deflect it, or you can hit it back with a sword. When you are hitting it you have to time it right, and to hit it back with a sword you use the use button with a sword in your hand.



### Into Fire

Goal: Pick up a blaze rod.

Kill a blaze and collect its dropped blaze rod. An easy way to do this is to find a nether fortress, then find a blaze spawner. Armed with over 7 snowballs, attack the blaze from range. Blazes don’t always drop their rods so you might have to try a few times. A potion of Fire Resistance is useful. Upon the blaze's death, collect the rod.



### Local Brewery

Goal: Pick up a Potion from one of the 3 lower Brewing Stand's slots.

Get a water bottle, Place it in one of the 3 lower brewing stand's slots, then put blaze powder in the fuel slot. Then put a potion ingredient in it, and wait until it is done brewing. If you don't have glass bottle, you can craft it using glass. To create glass, smelt sand:

| Ingredients       | Smelting recipe |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Sand+<br/>Anyfuel |                 |

Next, craft an glass bottle:

| Ingredients | Input » Output |
|-------------|----------------|
| Glass       | 3              |

Then fill the glass bottle with water, to turn it into a water bottle.

Arrange the ingredients like so to craft a brewing stand:

| Ingredients           | Input » Output |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Blaze Rod+Cobblestone |                |



### 

Goal: Enter an end portal.

Throw ender eyes and follow them to locate a stronghold.

Then find the stronghold's portal room.

After that activate the portal by using an eye of ender in every empty end portal edge block slot, then jump into the portal.

Arrange the ingredients like so to craft an eye of ender:

| Ingredients              | Input » Output |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| Ender Pearl+Blaze Powder |                |



### Adventuring Time

Goal: Set foot in 17 biomes.

Travel and step into 17 biomes in the game.

Note: This achievement is almost unobtainable in old worlds.

### The End.

Goal: Enter the Exit Portal after killing the ender dragon.

Here is how to slay it:

- Destroy theend crystalsusing projectiles (likesnowballs,eggs,boworcrossbowwitharrows, etc.)
- After they are destroyed, hit the ender dragon using projectiles (like bow with arrows, etc.). An enchantedbowwould probably be the best option.
- When you kill the ender dragon, you will gain 60-78 levels ofexperienceand a return portal will generate. Get the experience, and (optionally) thedragon egg. Then, enjoy thecredits. (You can press Esc to skip the credits.)



### 

Goal: Spawn the wither.

Here are some tips for how to spawn it:

- Soul sandorsoul soilare not that difficult to acquire. It can be found in the Nether in soul sand valley biomes. Just watch out forghastsand other hostile mobs that spawn in the Nether.Wither skulls on the other hand are difficult to obtain. Here are the best tips available.
- To increase spawn rates, break down the walls to have more floor space.
- Remove anyblazesand theirspawners, (unless you are skilled in making experience farms using them).
- Wear diamond armor (or netherite) and bring a fire resistance potion (for blazes and accidental lava deaths).
- It is also helpful to have a diamond sword (or netherite) with theLootingIII enchantment.
- Have lots of patience. You'll need it since wither skulls are a rare drop and you need 3.
- Be careful of the wither skeleton's attacks. They give you the Wither effect, which is poisonous and extremely deadly. It may be a good idea to bring milk.
- Snowballs are also a terrific way to defeat blazes.
- Every 15 blocks or so, put a bar so the walkway is only two blocks high. Wither skeletons cannot walk under anything that is less than three blocks tall.

Once you have three wither skeleton skulls and four soul sand, build the wither as follows:

### The Beginning.

Goal: Kill the wither.

This is the easiest way to defeat the wither, however, some would say it takes the fun out of killing the wither. It's your game, so play it how you want to play. but this is the most efficient way:

- Go to the Nether.
- Dig up until you reach the top bedrock.
- Look for a 3×3 area of bedrock with the center block so it has nothing behind it.
- Exactly three blocks down, place a piston. Next to it place a lever.
- Spawn the wither on the piston and pull the lever before it blows up. Run out of the blast radius.
- Once the wither blows up, it will be stuck in the bedrock ceiling and can't do any more damage. At this point hit it with whatever you like. It's kind of inefficient to do it with fists, but you could do it with anything, be careful when it reach half health, wither will explode and spawn 3-4 wither skeletons around it, and can start using dash attack. A netherite sword with Smite enchantment is quickest.
- Once the wither is dead, pick up the nether star.
