### Fending off ghasts
Ghasts are one of the hardest and most annoying mobs to fight in Minecraft, mainly because of their floating ability and their long-ranged fireball, which does considerable damage to both players and the landscape. If you are bridge-building across a lava sea, they might shoot you off. (One direct hit can kill an unarmored player.) That said, they do have several weaknesses: 

- They do not actually chase the player (nor flee), even after being attacked. They just move randomly around the landscape, firing at any player who comes into the line of sight (and range).
- Also, ghasts have 10 points of health (two fully charged shots with an unenchanted bow), so sniping them is not too difficult. A bow enchanted with evenPowerI or a critical hit can one-shot them.
- The fireballs are fairly easy to dodge, but they also tear up the landscape, not to mention setting it afire. However, the player can also bounce a fireball away by hitting it (fist, weapon, tool, anything works) as comes near. The fireball usually goes in the direction of the player's gaze. If the player manages to hit the ghast with its own fireball, it dies instantly, awarding the player the "Return to Sender"achievement/advancement. Be forewarned that this takes practice, so don't expect to use this method as the sole defence against ghasts. The player can also deflect the fireball by hitting it with an arrow, a snowball or even anegg.
- The classic defense is to build a mini-shelter out of cobblestone, 3 blocks high with a ladder to let the player poke their head (and bow) over the top, and preferably a 3Ã—3 roof two squares above that for protection. Note that if the ghast can't see you, they don't fire.
- If a ghast does come into reach the player can also hit them with a sword. This can happen when they spawn in a cave, or just randomly fly into one, or happen to fly close to the ground. Besides this being a rare opportunity, you may also need to dodge or bounce fireballs at close range.
- If there is more than one ghast attacking the player, the best option is to run and/or hide. If the player sprints, fireballs cannot hit the player. If they can get out of sight from all but one, they can then focus on shooting down that one.
- Ghasts don't spawn incrimson forestsandwarped forests. On the contrary, you may want to avoidsoul sand valleybiomes as ghast spawns are abundant there, however if a ghast spawns in a biome where ghasts can spawn, such as a Nether Waste or Soul Sand Valley, a ghast can end up drifting into a crimson forest or a warped forest, on random.
- If a ghast is spotted in the distance and if you do not have any ranged weapons, It is recommended to leave the area, and take cover. tunneling into a wall and sealing the entrance, ghasts are unlikely to enter small or isolated areas, such as caves or ravines. Ghasts also do not enter structures, such as Nether Fortresses and Bastions, making these areas good places to hide from ghasts. Do not head directly to a nether portal to escape a ghast , ghast fireballs can destroy the portal, making it hard for players to return if they do not have a flint and steel.

### Fighting hoglins
Hoglins have high health and a lot of knockback resistance. However they can be burned, and they fear warped fungi. Some ways to get away from them are:

- Let thepiglinskill it.
- Usewarped fungito scare them, which prevents them from attacking, then hit them as they retreat.
- Burn them with fire or lava.
- Dig a 1-wide hole on the nearby wall and hit them from inside.
- Sprint/critical hit them.
- Spam click to knock them back while damaging them.
- Build a 4 block pillar to kill the hoglins with a ranged weapon, or dump lava on them.
	- More risky, build 3 blocks up and crouch to melee attack them. However, Hoglins can still occasionally get you from this height and knock you off the pillar. If you are not on a flat area, they can get up on another block enabling them to hit you. Always examine where you are building up.
	- If you lack any tools or ranged weapons, it is best to avoid crimson forests and some bastion variants, if you spawned in a crimson forest, avoid hoglins, hide behind blocks or trees, hoglins do not attack you if you are not close to them, or if you are not in their line of sight. If a hoglin does spot you run to a group of piglins, as piglins are known to kill hoglins, hiding or getting to a high area is also a good idea, as hoglins have a hard time of reaching these areas. Placing down a warped fungus can scare hoglins away, as well as luring them into lava lakes and ruined portals.

If there is nothing around to scare off a hoglin and your armor is low, you are best using ranged weapons or fire to kill hoglins. 

### Resources found in the Nether
- Netherrack,soul sand,gravel,lava,magma block,glowstone,nether quartz ore,soul soil,blackstoneand its variants,nether gold ore,basalt,crimson stem,warped stem, are all freely available. Note that while the player can pillar-jump to mine a high glowstone formation, a little exploration may reveal more accessible blobs of the stuff (look for places with low ceilings).
- Crimson and warped fungusare found incrimson forestsandwarped forests
- Red and brown mushroomsare likewise found scattered about.
- Ghastssometimes dropghast tearsand/orgunpowder.
- Magma cubescan dropmagma cream.
- Zombified piglinssometimes droprotten fleshandgold nuggets. They can dropgolden swordsandgold ingots. However, attacking these is unwise until the player is prepared to handle a lot of them.
- The player can also minenether quartz, used for advancedredstonecomponents, and decorative purposes as well. Fortune is a true gift here.
- Obsidiancan be farmed with nether portals. View thenether portalfor more details (the diamond pickaxes needed to mine these can rarely be traded for emeralds by some villagers, making them renewable).
- Blackstone can be used as a substitution for cobblestone in the Nether, or as a good building material.
- Nether gold ore can be mined to getgold nuggets, which can then be crafted intogold ingots.
- Ancient debris can be used to craftnetheriteitems.

Once the player finds a nether fortress, they can obtain several other resources:

- Nether bricks,nether brick fences, andnether brick stairs. These are ghast-resistant and non-flammable building materials. They can also be crafted from smelted netherrack, but that takes some time and effort. The nether fortress ismadeof nether brick, including those massive support pillars and all the decorative fencing.
- Nether wart, which the player can grow onsoul sand. The player can also grow it back in theOverworld, provided they brought back some soul sand.
- Blazesdropblaze rods, and are the only source of them.
- Wither skeletonsoccasionally drop their skulls, which can eventually be used to spawn thewither. They also providecoal, andbones(bone meal for plants).

Once player finds a bastion remnant, they can obtain several other resources:

- Pigstepmusic disc
- Nether wart (alternative way)
- Gilded blackstone, which generates only in such structures
- Severalblocks of gold

Piglins can be bartered with for a variety of resources:

- Blocks:Blackstone,crying obsidian, gravel,obsidian,soul sand
- Materials:Ender pearls,leather, iron nuggets,nether bricks(individual bricks),nether quartz,stringandwaterbottles
- Other useful items: Fire charges, potions of Fire Resistance (regular or splash), spectral arrows (regular arrows inBedrock Edition), and boots or books withSoul Speed.
