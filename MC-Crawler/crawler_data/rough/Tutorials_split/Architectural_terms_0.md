# Tutorials/Architectural terms
This page explains the definition for a variety of terms used when building in Minecraft. This is not a comprehensive list; only those terms which are usable for features at normal Minecraft scales will be covered.

## List of terms
| Term         | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Corbel       | Corbels, and the technique of 'corbelling' are used in various ways in architecture. Prior to the development of the methods now used for arches, a corbel arch was a 'fake' arch that just edged the stones out from a wall a little at a time until they met, without changing the shape or orientation of the stones in the ways that would be done for a true arch. 'Corbel' is also a term for a support, usually ofstone, that has been keyed into the supporting wall so that it is stronger than aconsolewould be. |
| Counterfort  | A supporting structure for a dam orretaining wall, similar to abuttress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Also a shortened term for adormer window, a window within a dormer structure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Embrasure    | If a wall is partly hollowed out from the inside, this is known as anembrasure. They may be used as a site for arrow slits, or as a firing hole for a cannon, or to broaden the opening around an arch or doorway. SeeWalls and buttresses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Light        | The termlightis used not only for actual lights, but also for some types of window – hence 'skylight', 'fanlight', 'transom light' and so forth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Slab ceiling | This is a Minecraft-specific term for a ceiling made ofslabs. These have less disadvantages than slab floors, as the only common ceiling 'furniture' are lights of various kinds, but using a slab ceiling does still impose a limit on the ceiling materials available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Slab floor   | This is a Minecraft-specific term for a floor made ofslabs. These are used with some furniture types, which rely on having a half-height base – a slab – in order to look correct. It also makes it possible to approximate skirting boards using step blocks while staying in scale with the rest of the room. The disadvantage of a slab floor is that only a small number of Minecraft blocks have slab variants available, which limits the possible floor types, and the newcarpettiles cannot be used.               |
| Stay         | A usually nautical term for a rope, wire or rod which helps hold a structure in position. Often used for ships' masts and other very tall, thin structures, and sometimes for certain designs ofretaining wall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Transom      | A horizontal structural beam or bar, or the crosspiece separating a door from a window above it. Also a shortened term for atransom window, ortransom light.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
