# Tutorials/Defeating a bastion remnant
Defeating a bastion remnant allows the player to obtain lots of loot, including valuable gold items, the pigstep music disc, and the snout banner pattern. Exploring them is also required to unlock the netherite tier, as they are the only place where netherite upgrade smithing templates can be found. Due to having magma cube spawners (treasure room bastion variant only), bastion remnants also provide a good source of magma cream. Bastion remnants are one of the toughest and most dangerous structures to beat, so extra care has to be taken to survive. You will see piglins and piglin brutes in the bastion, so be careful.

## What to bring
- Strong, durablearmorideally of diamond tier with enchantments. A set of enchanted iron armor may also work, but is considerably more dangerous.
- At least one piece of golden armor if you don't want to aggravate regular piglins.  This will not prevent piglin brutes from attacking.  Golden helmets have the least durability of all pieces of golden armor, but is the only piece that has the same strength as its iron counterpart.
- Aswordand tools of at least iron or diamond tier, preferably enchanted withSharpnessandUnbreaking.Fire Aspectcan also be useful for dealing extra damage, but is not required.
- Abow, especially with thePowerand/orInfinityenchantments, is very useful in dispatching piglins and piglin brutes with ease from a safe distance.
	- PunchII is recommended, as they can knock back enemies and can also be used to knock off piglins and brutes off the ledges.
- At least oneshield, as they can prevent taking damage. Piglin brutes can use their axes to disable shields, but due to their high damage per hit, especially at Hard difficulty, blocking even a single hit can be the difference between life and death.
- Foodwith high-enough saturation and hunger restoration. (such assteak,golden carrot, andcooked porkchops).Golden apples (optional) can heal the player quickly.
- Bring somelogsand/orplanksto craftboats, which will be very useful against piglin brutes and melee piglins (see the Mobs section below on how to use them).  However, boats cannot be crafted from crimson/warped planks.
- Expendable blocks you can easily obtain, place, and break. Good examples includedirt,cobblestone, andnetherrack.
	- Do notbuild with wood or other flammable materials, especially if you are building nearfire or lava.  Crimson and Warped wood are fire-resistant and safe to build with.
- Apickaxeof at leastirontier to minegold blocks.It may also be helpful to enchant it withEfficiencyorUnbreaking.
- Alava bucketto easily kill piglins and piglin brutes (optional, but highly recommended).
- Potionscan improve combat.Fire Resistanceis incredibly useful, and can be obtained by simplybarteringwith piglins (optional).
- Soul torchesor other soul-fire items can be used to scare piglins (optional).  Does not work on piglin brutes.
- Goldto distract piglins and gather precious resources (ex.ender pearls).  Does not work on piglin brutes.
- TNT(optional), and abuttonor apressure plate(notflint and steel) to light the TNT.  Activating TNT usingredstoneprevents the piglins from attributing a player to the TNT's ignition, whereas a flint and steel will aggravate all nearby piglins towards whoever lit the TNT as soon as it explodes.
- Hoppersfor lootingchestswithout aggravating any piglins (optional).
- Blocks of Ironandcarved pumpkinsforiron golems(optional).
- Pistonsandlevers,buttonsorredstone torchesto movegilded blackstonefrom underchestsso you can puthoppersthere to get the items (optional).
- Arespawn anchorandglowstone, to respawn in the Nether (optional).
- A bunch oftotems. Not only can totems save your life but when you fall in lava it now gives Fire Resistance so you can hide in lava for a little while. It's still better to bring some additional potions as they last longer.
- Enchanted golden applesare optional, they're rare but can be a lifesaver.
- Ender pearlscan be a multipurposed tool, used for either escaping or repositioning.


there are also crossbows, arrows, armor, and weapons in chests.

## Your main goals
- Get as many blocks of gold andgilded blackstoneas you can.
	- Also, since somenetheriteitems reside in loot chests, also aim for gettinglodestone,ancient debris,netherite scrap, andnetherite ingots from the chests.
- Defeat as manypiglin brutes as possible.
- Get thePigstep music disc,snout banner pattern,snout armor trim, andnetherite smithing template.
- Convert the bastion to a bartering hall or magma cube/froglight farm.
- Obtain Nether Wart (if not obtained already) (only applies to Housing)

## Mobs
### General
Unlike most Nether mobs, piglins, hoglins, and piglin brutes are not immune to fire damage.  This makes bastion remnants one of the few places in the nether where the Flame and Fire Aspect enchantments can prove beneficial.

### Piglin Brutes
Piglin brutes are variants of piglins that are unique to bastion remnants and are capable of dealing massive amounts of damage in a single hit thanks to their golden axe. The higher the difficulty, the more damage they deal, up to 19 attack damage in hard difficulty.  Their heavy hits also mean that armor offers much less protection: A full set of unenchanted iron armor only reduces the attack damage by 22%. To make matters worse, due to the fact that piglin brutes use axes instead of swords, they have the ability to disable shields.

Fortunately, unlike regular piglins, piglin brutes do not respawn when killed, meaning you won't have to worry about them reappearing once you clear all of them out of the bastion.

Here are some tips and tricks on how to defeat piglin brutes:

Ranged Weapons

When forced to draw some sort of weapon against a piglin brute, the use of ranged weapons is your best bet.  Try to shoot them off ledges and preferably into lava.  The Punch enchantment can assist. If they land in lava, there is nothing they can do and they burn to death.  Only EXP and possibly a golden axe will be at-risk of disappearing into lava. This will have to be done from a long range, so that a horde of angry piglins don't rush up at you while you are charging your ranged weapon. Engaging in head-to-head melee combat with the piglin brute is to always be avoided (especially if playing on Java Edition) unless you know what you are doing.

If you're good at sniping, you may also be able to avoid aggravating nearby piglins as piglins can only alert nearby allies that are within 16 block away from the area where the piglin took damage, not the player's location.
