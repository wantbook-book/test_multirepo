## Other players

Main article: Tutorials/PvP
The hardest enemy to defeat, all players have 20 × 10 health. If you are engaged in a duel, you should equip yourself with at least the same gear as your opponent. It will be great if you could get some help, either from allied players, tamed wolves, iron golems, and/or snow golems. 

Engaging other players may possibly be the most challenging fights in Minecraft, depending on the player and the other's skill. Observe battle tactics and use them to your advantage. Combine weapons and defenses to deal high melee to defeat your opponent most effectively.

## Allies
### Iron golems

See also: Iron golem

If built by a player, an iron golem is passive towards players and can be useful as an ally. Being one of the most powerful mobs in the game, with 100 × 50 HP, it can kill most mobs in one or two hits. However, it is also a bit expensive to build, requiring 36 iron ingots, and apart from creating it, the player has no control over it. It also takes longer to build than a snow golem, making it less useful as a last resort. In general, it's a better idea to use wolves instead, as they are easier to acquire. However, an iron golem has the advantage that it can attack where the player is far away or inattentive, making them useful in mob traps and base defending. It may also be useful when the player is in the Nether and fighting blazes and wither skeletons. Remember that iron golems do not take fall damage and cannot be knocked back.

### Snow golems

See also: Snow golem

Despite dealing no damage, the snow golem's use in combat is not to be underestimated. Defensively, they can either knock enemies away from the player's base, or lure them into a trap. They are very cheap to make, and offensively, they can distract mobs, making them much easier for players to kill, as after being hit by a snowball, they will ignore the player to attack the golem. This allows players to make easy kills on most mobs. They also alert them if a mob approaches from behind, as well as slowing it. If players need to retreat, place a snow golem or two to occupy incoming mobs, buying them plenty of time to escape or let their health regenerate. Unfortunately, they do not attack creepers, so players may want to take a cat with them if possible.

### Wolves

See also: Wolf

Tamed wolves can be very useful in a battle. They attack mobs that their owner attacks, or mobs that are attacking their owner, with few exceptions:

- They never attack creepers, ghasts, or other tamed animals.
- They attackskeletonsand their variants without provokation, unless sitting.

Skeletons and their variants also avoid wolves.

### Foxes

See also: Fox

Foxes can't be tamed like wolves, but if you breed two stray foxes, their baby is "trusting" you and attacks other players (and some mobs, depending on edition of the game) that attack you. This isn't very useful on its own, as fox is relatively weak, dealing only 2 damage on Easy and Normal, and 3 on Hard. However, they can hold an item in their mouth and use it. This includes totems of undying (totem gets used up if fox receives fatal damage), chorus fruits (fox eats it and teleports randomly, potentially causing much confusion to your opponent), but most importantly, swords. A fox holding a maxed netherite sword becomes quite a powerful ally if your opponent doesn't have any ranged weapons.

### Cats

See also: Cat

Tamed cats don't deal any damage toward mobs or players, but they do scare away creepers and phantoms, which might be useful in a battle.

### Other allies
Many mobs attack other mobs without provocation; they can be allies in the battle too. For example, piglins attack wither skeletons and sometimes hunt hoglins. Vindicators named "Johnny" attack most mobs, except fellow illagers and ghasts. Zoglins attack most mobs, except creepers and ghasts.

Furthermore, withers attack most mobs, except undead and ghasts. Wardens attack every mob that angers them. Thus, one might come up with a strategy for defeating wardens and withers by making them battle each other. A 1v1 match between those two is usually very close (exact result depends on terrain, difficulty and edition of the game), and the winner comes up severely weakened, making it much easier to kill.

However, despite the fact that both wardens and withers are naturally hostile toward the ender dragon, neither is useful in such a fight. Wardens are incapable of dealing any damage to the dragon; withers may occasionally land a hit and damage it, but dragon's regeneration from end crystals is far too fast for this method to be effective. Note that the dragon is not hostile to any mob and only ever attacks the player (but it might damage other mobs unintentionally).

Even if two mob types are not enemies by default, they can still attack each other in certain circumstances. For example, if a zombie and a skeleton are both pursuing the player, skeleton's arrow can sometimes hit the zombie. If player didn't hit either of those mobs yet, they will start fighting each other. This is especially useful with mobs that exhibit pack behavior (e.g. zombies, zombified piglins, stray wolves), because multiple mobs attack your enemy at once.

All of these behaviors can be found on the Monster_infighting page.

## The equipment
### Sword
- Style: Offensive, direct
- Range: Melee
- Damage: Varies with material

The primary weapon is the most versatile to use. A sword's damage varies on material and a rule of thumb is the rarer the material, the stronger the sword (with the exception of gold). A sword deals far more damage than by hand, and will greatly increase a player's chance of survival upon being faced with hostile mobs. Even the wooden sword, the lowest tier of sword, deals four times as much damage as the fist (and each further increase in material increases the damage of the sword by half a heart). Swords may also deal sweeping attacks capable of splash damage when the attack bar is full, making short work of grouped mobs. A sword, like many of the weapons mentioned here, has a limited amount of uses, and disappears when its uses reach zero. Again, the higher tier the sword is, the more uses it has, and each tier approximately doubles the uses that a sword possesses, apart from the diamond, which has more than 5 times the number of uses as iron. Enchanting the sword can also greatly increase its power.
