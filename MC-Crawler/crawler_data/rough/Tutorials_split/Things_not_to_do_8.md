#### Being unprepared for boss fights
If the player finds an end portal, has the soul sand and skulls required to make the wither, or finds an ocean monument, and the player decides to defeat these bosses, that player must bring enough equipment as well as the right equipment. These are some suggested items for boss fights:

- High protection enchantediron,diamond, ornetheritearmor
- Asword, preferably diamond, netherite or enchanted (Sharpnessfor the ender dragon andguardians;Smitefor thewither)
- A bow, also preferably enchanted (InfinityandPowerfor the dragon and wither)
- AnImpaling Vtridentto kill guardians
- Golden applesorHealth potions
- Building blocks or ladders to navigate the terrain
- Milk, since it removes theWitherandMining Fatigueeffects (Not needed for the dragon).
- Note that Milk also removes beneficial potion effects such as Water Breathing & Night Vision. Be sure to bring extra potions to restore those desired effects that were removed from drinking Milk. This is important to remember when relying on potion effects to explore ocean monuments.
- Friends: it is easier with more than one person, so if the player is on a server it is better to fight as a group. Onsingleplayer, wolves, axolotls, and golems could work as a partial substitute.
- A helmet (orturtle shell) enchanted withRespirationandAqua Affinityand boots enchanted withDepth Striderfor fighting guardians and maneuvering around ocean monuments
- Potionof Water Breathing (for guardians only)
- Potion of Slow Falling for the ender dragon fight, to safely drift back down if knocked into the air.
- If the player is fighting the wither, it is effective to do so in a low-ceiling cave so the player can have the option of using melee attacks.
- Do not fight the wither with melee attacks in the Nether without making sure there is no lava lake below the floor for the fight.

#### Silverfish
Once the player attacks a silverfish (usually in strongholds), it awakens all other silverfish in the vicinity, meaning the player has many silverfish to deal with. If the player uses a weapon that can kill it in one hit, or if deals damage through indirect means (for example by lighting a fire with flint and steel), the silverfish does not call reinforcements. A diamond sword, or an axe that is stone or better, can kill a silverfish in one hit. Note that the sweeping effect from a sword could damage nearby silverfish without killing.

#### Snow golems and beds
Because of the fact that snow layers count as a block, any snow layers next to the bed a player slept in may result in the player waking up standing on their bed, and chancing waking up inside a block if the player's ceiling is only 2 blocks above, which may result in suffocation damage to the player. The player may also not respawn at their bed if they die, because it is obstructed. To avoid this, keep snow golems away from player beds. Also, if the player must sleep in a snowy biome, the player should remove any nearby snow blocks.

#### Not bringing the right equipment for ocean monuments
Ocean monuments are dangerous to an unprepared player. Guardians spawn in them, which do 4.5 hearts of damage on hard, and 3 elder guardians, which inflict Mining Fatigue III to the player, which makes breaking blocks nearly impossible, even when an inflicted player uses a netherite pickaxe with efficiency. The proper equipment for some players is:

- Enchantedarmor (minimally with Respiration)
- A fairly large amount offood
- A good weapon without theKnockbackorPunchenchantments
- Pickaxes should be enchanted with Efficiency if the player plans to mine with mining fatigue.
- Slime blocks,honey blocks, or TNT. These blocks can be broken instantly, even with mining fatigue, and can be used to break line of sight with guardians and make them cancel their attacks. They can also be arranged to produce air pockets.
- A large amount of doors to produce air pockets.

Optional useful equipment includes:

- Adoor‌[Java Edition  only]to create an air pocket. The air pocket replenishes the player's air.
- Conduits, as the large supply of prismarine makes it easy to build a frame. The conduit power grants water breathing, improves visibility, and improves speed.
- Milk (optional, but can get rid of the mining fatigue effect for a few seconds or after the player kills all theelder guardians). Milk is useless in Bedrock Edition because Mining Fatigue returns instantly after drinking milk.
- TNT, some solid blocks, andredstone blocks(optional). This can be used to blast into the monument by placing the TNT against the side or top of the monument, surrounding it with blocks, and placing the redstone block nearby to power the TNT.
- A hoe to break the sponges if they generate (optional)
- Various potions are useful: Water Breathing, Night Vision, Invisibility, Instant Health I or II, Regeneration, Strength
- A few buckets of axolotls, asaxolotlsfight guardians and elder guardians.

#### Woodland mansions
While they contain plenty of chest loot and are absolutely massive, the woodland mansions also contain illagers, which are hostile versions of villagers. Two kinds are found: vindicators and evokers. Both are extremely dangerous to fight. These structures are designed for the end-game, so make sure to bring the best gear. 

#### Witch-fighting while unprepared
Witches are dangerous. They throw negative splash potions at the player such as poison, instant harming, weakness, and slowness. Witches have 26 × 13 hearts—6 more than the player. Players should never go unprepared when fighting a witch, because no matter how strong the player's armor is, it does not protect the player from the potions. Also, witches drink positive potions such as Instant Healing, Speed, Fire Resistance, and Water Breathing. Lava, flint and steel and Fire Aspect weapons are ineffective against witches because they can drink a potion of Fire Resistance to negate these effects. Witches are also impossible to drown since they drink potions of water breathing. Splash potions are also not useful against witches due to the fact that they are 85% resistant to splash potions, which is almost equivalent to not taking any damage from them at all. It is suggested the player use a bow to kill a witch, as the bow has a much further range than the witch's potions. Using good armor enchanted with Protection is a great help as well.‌[Java Edition  only] If the player chooses to engage a witch in melee combat, then the player should kill the witch quickly as witches cannot throw potions at varying speeds, milk is also great as it removes poison, a dangerous negative status effect that can drop the player down to 1 heart, allowing the Witch to easily finish the player off with a harming splash potion.
