## Bucket jumping
To ascend a cliff, an alternative to ladders or pillar jumping is to use a bucket of water to place water as high as possible, then swim to the top of the waterfall, put the water back into the bucket, and quickly place a new waterfall at an even higher point. By repeating this process, a player can reach the top of the cliff. If the waterfall is left there, it can be used to travel back and forth.

The player can also jump off a high point and dump the bucket of water onto the ground before they touch the ground so they can land safely in the water, although this is a famously risky and difficult technique to pull off even once. Do it if you have faith in your abilities, or if you can recover your stuff if something goes wrong.

Buckets of lava can also do the second trick if the player has Fire Resistance potions, but it might be harder if the fall distance is too short or a lot of flammable structures or blocks are nearby. A good way is to drink a 3-minute fire resistance potion before jumping. This trick is good for the nether since water dries immediately when placed and the nether is filled with lots of high ledges and ridges. You might not want to use lava to do this near your base.

## Ascending and descending
Oftentimes when you are on your adventure, you need to either go up or go down a significant height, usually a high cliff or overhang. Following is a few methods that can be used to traverse vertically.

- If there is a relatively straight wall to one side, blocks can be placed to form a staircase along the side. If there isn't and you are going up, find or place a block above the floor, sneak to the edge of it, look on its side and place a block, then place a block on that, and jump on top and repeat until you reach your destination.
- Water can be poured to the edge of cliffs and drops, creating a flowing water column or stream to descend and later ascend, as well as a water surface at the bottom to land safely.
- If the cliff is a straight wall, eitherladdersorvinescan be placed to go up and later go back down.
- Warped vinescan be planted on the ground andbone mealapplied to make them grow. The vines can be climbed to reach the destination up high and later go back down. Similarly,weeping vinescan be hung and fed on the ceiling to reach down the ground and later back up.
- Scaffoldingscan be easily stacked to temporarily reach something up high, and after the task is done, as easily knocked down by breaking the bottom block. They can also be installed permanently to move up and down between vertical locations.
