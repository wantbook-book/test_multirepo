## Breaking bedrock
Depending on the method, breaking bedrock can either be a simple build, or a complex process.

** Needs **
- 2pistons
- 2TNT
- 1lever
- 1trapdoor
- 2blocks
- A 3×2×2 space

** Pros **
- Cheap, fast and easy
- Small contraption

** Cons **
- Needs a fast-paced clicking, or an autoclicker
- Will do around 3points ofdamageto the player.
- Only breaks 1 block per 2 TNT used



### Method 1
[Bug Used: MC-27056]

This method uses update priority and headless pistons to break bedrock. While it can seem needlessly complex to do this for one block of bedrock, it is the preferred method to destroy large quantities of bedrock.

** Needs (mostly not counted, since there are many ways to use this method) **
- Sticky pistons
- Pistons
- Redstone repeaters
- Redstone comparators
- Redstone blocks
- Redstone
- Blocksof any kind
- Obsidian[note 1]
- Rails, 1powered rail, 1activator rail[note 1]
- 1minecart with TNT[note 1][note 2]
- 1lever[note 1]

** Pros **
- It can be done early in the game to clear a few bedrock blocks, since it does not require many resources.
- It can be done quickly after some practice.
- It can be easily extented to make some more automated machines.

** Cons **
- It is very complicated, and one mistake means having to completely start over.

### Method 2
This method requires a one block deep 1×4 block trench in the bedrock directly above the Nether portal that brought you to the Nether. It only works with the ceiling of the Nether and requires that there are no other portals within 16 blocks in the Nether or 128 blocks in the Overworld. These are the materials you will need:

- A lot of transparent, non-spawnable blocks (glass,slabs, etc.) [note 1]

Note: This amount can change drastically depending on the situation.

1. Place the non-spawnable blocks on every top surface of every block within 16 blocks horizontally and all the way up and down between the bedrock barriers.
2. Break the Nether portal that brought the player to the Nether.
3. Build another Nether portal at least 16 blocks away and use it to travel back to the Overworld.
4. Go back to the original portal and use it to go back to the Nether. This portal should spawn at the Nether ceiling, breaking some more of the bedrock. Repeat this to break more bedrock.

This method works by removing all of the valid places for a Nether portal. It forces the portal to generate in the bedrock, replacing some of it with the obsidian frame.

Pros:

- It is incredibly easy to accomplish.
- It is very fast.

Cons:

- It requires a lot of work to prepare the area.
- It requires the player to have already used one of the methods above to break the bedrock needed to utilize this.

Revised method using portals:




### Redstone Lag method
This method requires a number of pistons (for example, to break one bedrock, you need 2 pistons), a trapdoor, a lot of redstone, a lever, a full beacon powered with Haste II, a maxed out pickaxe and some temporary blocks. It also needs a mod called Tweakeroo.

First, place a lever and surround all sides of it with redstone. More redstone placed means the lag will last longer, but sometimes, the bedrock won't break if the lag is too long, so you would need to be precise. Set up a Haste II beacon, go to Tweakeroo settings, in the Generic tab, find "Fast Right Click Count" and set it to a number (in the tutorial it's 32), then in the Tweaks tab, find "Tweak Fast Right Click" and set it to true and optionally set a hotkey if you want. Then place a forward facing piston, a block on top, a redstone block on top of the block, a block beside the piston which would activate it, break the redstone block, place a trapdoor on the back of the piston, and right click on it, turn on the fast right click tweak and hold your right click, but make sure not to hold it too long. Then go to your piston, break the block beside the piston, enter crawl mode, break the piston (but make sure not to break the detached piston arm), and place down another piston, wait for a while and the piston should face forward again, break the piston and you would see it broke a piece of bedrock.

Pros:

- You can repeat this process without losing any materials, unlike the method which uses pistons and TNT.
- Can break multiple bedrock blocks at once

Cons:

- Quite expensive (needs a good pickaxe and a full Haste II beacon)
- Might take multiple attempts to successfully finish
- Requires a mod
- Because of the lag, if you have elytra on, you will behave weirdly if you open your elytra (minor issue)

(Bug MC-213813)

This method requires snapshot 21w05a due to the use of dripleaves.

It has been patched in snapshot 21w06a.

#### Needs
- 1Claypersmall dripleaf
- someBone Meal
- 1small dripleafper bedrock broken
- Shearsto break the dripleaves

#### Pros
- Very easy to do, requires few materials
- Materials can be reused continuously

#### Cons
- Can use up a lot of bone meal depending on luck

### Outdated


#### Method 3
Introduced in 1.17.0 and patched in 1.17.30 and above.

This easy method ‌[Bedrock Edition  only] uses powder snow. 

You will only need:

- 2 buckets of powder snow
- 1 cauldron

1. Place the cauldron underneath the bedrock you want to break
2. Use the buckets of powder snow on the cauldron and the powder snow will replace the bedrock
