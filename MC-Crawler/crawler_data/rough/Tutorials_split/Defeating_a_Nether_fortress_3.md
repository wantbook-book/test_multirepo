## General structure
The nether fortress is made of nether brick, which is fire resistant. The structure contains corridors with chests in them and contain gold ingots, horse armor, diamonds, nether wart, iron ingots and even armor. There are stairwells that will lead you to different parts of the fortress. The structure also spans over lava lakes and may be broken in places.

## Specific Structure Features
A nether fortress has two types of easily distinguishable walkways: corridors and bridges.

### Corridors
Corridors are the "indoors" part of a fortress. They are easily distinguishable by their 3×3 walkway encased in nether brick with 2×1 nether brick fences for 'windows'. Under the corridors solid nether brick generates to the surface. This is what makes the main 'fort' buildings of the fortresses: a set of nether brick corridors positioned above or around the surrounding bridges, with the solid nether brick to the surface giving it a fort-like look. Chests generate in the turns of these corridors and they can generate the all-important nether wart farm and blaze spawners. They are in most ways the safer parts of a nether fortress, because unless you've mined through the walls or ceiling you cannot fall off or be attacked from afar.

### Bridges
The bridges look just like that: large bridges. They have a 5 block wide pathway with a one-block-high wall on both sides, all composed of nether bricks. Instead of the solid nether bricks that corridors have beneath , they have large solid arches. Note that the one-block-high 'railing' does not prevent you from falling off! The bridges often end broken-looking or abruptly end. The tunnels, when they generate, cut through netherrack which means if the fortress generates partly encased in netherrack, the bridges will generate as tunnels with a nether brick floor and netherrack walls and ceiling. Be careful when wandering around here, because if you're not careful you could be thrown off the bridge by an explosion, knocked back by an attack, or attacked from the other side of the fortress by the marauding blazes and ghasts.

### How They Generate Together
The bridges part generates first, and a lava well room acts as a transition between the bridges and the corridor. The corridors contain all the loot chests and nether wart farms, and the bridges contain both blaze spawners.

## Defeating the fortress
The fortress can be hard to see, as it looks like the Nether terrain, especially in nether wastes or crimson forest. When you find blocky structures made of nether brick, you have found it. Mark your "entrance" in some way. Use the right hand torch rule for navigating the fortress.

Don't stand around or waste time. Eating, checking your inventory, and not paying attention can risk you getting killed by a monster. Every few blocks, make a 2 block tall arch so you can escape wither skeletons.

Your key prizes are a nether wart plantation and a blaze spawner. There are two levels in a fortress, the corridors and the bridges (described above). The nether wart plantations are by the large staircases up to the bridges. The plantations are usually in an intersection, so be sure to block off the tunnels with a non-flammable block before harvesting the warts. Also take the soul sand, as relying on finding some is not smart. The blaze spawners are on top of the bridges, partially enclosed by fences.

Try to find as many chests as you can, and take the loot. If you find a plantation, dig up all the nether warts and soul sand. Don't forget to fill in the hole to avoid falling in.

If you are on a multiplayer server, it is good practice to replant the nether wart below the staircase, as that allows players that arrive later to obtain their first nether wart.

### Blaze Spawner
When you run into a blaze spawner, you have to light it up. You need to place glowstone, shroomlight, jack-o-lantern, or anything light level 15 surrounding the spawner on all sides. Be ready to fight a lot of blazes. It is recommended to defeat the spawner with Fire Resistance. To get Fire Resistance, you can get a potion from bartering with a piglin, or use a totem of undying. if you're feeling sneaky, you can switch to peaceful, build the farm around the spawner, then switch back, and you can completely avoid being killed.

It's also suggested to block all the other entrances to the spawner so mobs can't get in while you're fighting. Another good thing to do is to place some blocks on top of the spawner  to build a small platform (around two blocks from the spawner so blazes can still spawn) so that blazes can't fly out.

### Monsters
#### Wither Skeletons
Sprint attack them, like creepers, or shoot it with arrows. You don't want to get the Wither status effect. Also, take advantage that wither skeletons are 2.5 blocks tall by putting a slab above their head so you can run freely but they can't, creating pockets of wither skeletons you can easily pick off one by one.

#### Skeletons
Don't sprint hit. Strafe with A and D keys, or block with your shield and hit the skeletons. Also, you can shoot them.
