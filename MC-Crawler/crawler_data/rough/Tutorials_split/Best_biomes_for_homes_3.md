#### Cons
- Falling can be lethal depending on the height of the fall.
- The vibrant environment of the hills makes it hard to find a memorable landmark near either the player's base or their dropped items.
- The hilly terrain often provides little flat ground, making it hard to build structures.
- Infested stone(releasingsilverfish) are also scattered underground, which can be dangerous for the unprepared.
- Whileorescan spawn in the cliffs, it can be quite challenging to reach them because they are so high up.
- Digging down takes longer, as you are higher up. However, you can find a cave that goes down.

#### Useful resources
Cobblestone, snow, ice, stone, emerald ore, coal ore, flint, spruce wood.

#### Tips
- InBedrock Edition, infested stone can be avoided by seeing how long it takes to mine the supposedstoneblock. If it takes unusually long or takes the same time to mine regardless of what tool is used, it is infested. They can also be mined with aSilk Touchpickaxeif the player has one, because when mined with a Silk Touch pickaxe, they don't release silverfish. Consult theinfested blockpage for more information.
- A critical hit on a silverfish with an iron or better sword, or a stone or better axe[Java Edition only]should kill it in one hit and stop any nearby silverfish from attacking.
- To obtain more wood, gatheringsaplingsor building your house near its wooded variant is advised.
- Watch out for steep cliffs, as falling is possibly the leading cause of death in this biome. Boots enchanted withFeather Fallingare strongly advised.
- Asnow golem-based snow farm is much better than a weather-based one in both simplicity, efficiency and cost.

### Forest
The forest has a lot of trees, making it great for getting wood, but it also means that building a house here involves cutting down a couple of trees. Also, this can be a dangerous biome at night for beginners. There are many trees, allowing for mobs to hide from the player, and minimizing combat space, which is especially dangerous for creepers. Also, the forest provides shade, allowing skeletons and zombies to survive in the daytime.

#### Pros
- Lots of wood, which is a resource both new and experienced players require, due to its being the foundation of many essential crafting recipes.
- The hills makes for good scenery.
- Though normal houses may be hard to build, a treehouse is always a good solution.
- The density and low height of treetops can provide a useful alternative mode of travel, especially at night, since spiders cannot climb past the leaves and other harmful mobs cannot find many ways to follow youâ€”especially since they cannot jump over small gaps between trees. Just don't fall down!
- Has a small chance of being a "flower forest", and in that case, the biome is filled with exclusiveflowersthat are great for decoration anddyes. Also,rabbitsandbeescan spawn.
- Is hidden and harder for players to find or attack you on servers.
- Wolvescan spawn, making good companions and bodyguards.
- A plains biome is often nearby.
- The grass color is vibrant and green.

#### Cons
- Somewhat inconvenient to build in unless an area is cleared. (But the player gets a lot of wood in the process)
- Trees obstruct visibility.
- It is difficult to recognize any one section of the forest, which can be bad if you get lost. (Of course, the player can always ascend to the treetops to figure out directions.)
- Passive mobs can be hard to find due to the mass of trees around.
- Hostile mobs are surprisingly prevalent here depending on how dense the forest is.Skeletonscan shoot you from around corners,creeperscan sneak up from you from behind trees, and undead mobs have plenty of shade to shelter in during the day.
- Hard to run through due to the high amount of trees blocking your path. Also, horse riding here is near impossible, as suffocation in the trees is likely and hard to avoid without carefully traveling at speeds lower than simply sprinting without the horse.
- Fire andlightningstrikes are a major issue here as they can potentially start huge forest fires.

#### Useful resources
Wood, saplings, lily of the valley, rose bush, lilac, peony, wolves are useful resources found in forest biomes.

#### Tips
- Consider making this your resource base.
- Be wary of fires. It's far worse here than in every other biome except for the Nether (and maybe the jungle).
- Sometimes getting on top of trees helps. Your visibility of the forest increases and you can travel faster. It also acts as a temporary shelter during the night if you are desperate; if you break the blocks you used to get up, usually, mobs cannot reach you.
- Never let your guard down! As already stated, a dense enough forest can allow hostile mobs to spawn even in daytime, which can give the player a nasty surprise if they are not careful.
- Make watchtowers and beacons (not the block) in your resource base, clear out all trees and light up the area around them. This helps you to locate the resource base easier, stop hostile mobs from spawning and stop the unwanted forest fire.

#### Multiplayer
On Multiplayer, the forest is a good place to build a base. There is an abundance of wood and animals, as well as cover so that your base stays semi-hidden. However, building defenses is difficult in a forest, because the nearby trees must be cleared out. If you wanted to, you could burn some of the trees down, but make sure it doesn't get out of hand, lest you lose the forest! Never leave trees close to the perimeter of your base. It is easy for enemies to climb the trees and get over the wall. If doFireTick is off on the server, building a base out of wood might be a good idea, because of its abundance. However, it does not have as much blast resistance as stone or cobblestone.
