### Water or Lava Wall
Build a frame for your wall. Build two more frames, all touching. The middle one should be 1 block bigger on the top and bottom. Then, add water in the top gaps. The water should flow straight down into the trench at the bottom. 

Tip: To build an incinerator, make a wall, but use lava. You can use this as a trash can, to throw in any items you don't want.

### Swimming Pool
Swimming pools come in all shapes and sizes, so a lot of what a swimming pool looks like is up to you. One trick that is necessary when building 2, 3, and 4 block deep swimming pools, is in order to put water sources in every empty space, start by digging only 1 down for every block, and put the water layer there. Then, for the deeper parts, dig however many blocks down you want that part of the pool to be, and the water should flow down.

Here is an example of how to build a swimming pool. This one has an L shape to it.

1. Build a 10×5 hole in the ground. Make it only 1 block deep.
2. Build a 5×5 hole in front of the previous hole you made, connecting to it. You should now have an L-shaped hole.
3. Fill all of the empty pool withbuckets of water.
4. Dig down 2 blocks for the 5×5 hole you made. Now you should have a 3-block deep pool in that section. This is the deep end of your pool (3 meters, or 10 feet deep).
5. For the half of the 10×5 hole that's closest to the 5×5, dig down 1, to make a 2-block deep section. This is the medium end of your pool (2 meters, or 6 1/2 feet deep).This picture is an example of an L-shaped swimming pool. It also has many decorations and accessories, including 3 diving boards.
6. For the other half of the 10×5 hole, leave it how it is, to make a 1-block deep section. (1 meter, or 3 feet deep)
7. You have finished the basic outline of your pool. Now add some decoration and accessories.

#### Decorating and Accessories
A pool can have many accessories added to it to make it more decorated and more fun. Here are some tips:

- Make the bottom of the floorconcrete.Polished Diorite,Block of QuartzorSmooth Stoneare some alternate choices.
- Build a 3 wide path around the perimeter using concrete or other blocks.Dark Prismarineand otherprismarineblocks can be a great accent material.
- Make diving boards out ofquartz, quartz slabs, andladders. You can make them 1, 2, and 4 blocks high for low, medium, and high dives.
- Putpotted flowersin each of the corners of the pool.
- Usewood planksand ladders to make the base of a lifeguard chair. For the chair, use awood stairwithitem framesbeside it. If you want a roof to the lifeguard chair, use limewool, usingfenceposts to connect the chair to the roof.
- Use quartz slabs and light blue wool to make lounge chairs.
- Plantsaplingsaround the perimeter of the pool, and grow them intotrees. Make sure you place them far apart from each other and not too close to the pool, because trees can grow very big sometimes.
- Useglowstoneorsea lanternsfor underwater lights (not shown in picture).
- Add a smaller, shallower pool nearby, for a hot tub or kiddie pool (not shown).
