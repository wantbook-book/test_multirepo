## Aerial platform
An aerial spawning platform offers a way to farm naturally-spawned drowned, which can drop tridents when killed by the player, in Java Edition and in Bedrock Edition. Like the flooded dungeon above, the most basic aerial drowned farm doesn't require exotic materials, but it requires a large quantity of common materials such as cobblestone, water, and glass. You'll also need some slabs, wooden buttons or signs to control water flow, as well as a hopper and a chest.

This farm relies on light attenuation by water to create sufficient darkness in a spawning room with flowing water to sweep the drowned into a killing area.

- The general-purpose spawning room works in bothJava Editionand Bedrock Edition, but Bedrock Edition has an interesting feature that allows for a simpler alternative, in which one layer of water attenuates light by 2 levels and provides further attenuation of 1 light level per block of distance beneath the water layer. Therefore, a single layer of water on a glass roof attenuates full sunlight to zero 13 blocks below the water. This farm was built and tested inBedrock Editionusing this feature as an alternative.
- Efficiency: The point of this tutorial is to describe a basic survival-build farm that produces tridents and nautilus shells. It can be made more efficient by contriving to put aturtle eggorvillagerin the center of the spawning platform to draw the drowned to their death.

### Components
The main components of an aerial drowned farm are (from lowest to highest elevation):

- inBedrock Edition, a location, preferably indeep ocean, preferably at least 50 blocks away from land
- inJava Edition, a river biome (use the F3 screen to confirm you are in a river biome)
- A tower to climb, from which to build structures at high altitudes
- A killing platform
- A drop shaft
- A drop platform; a small water platform some distance (like 20 blocks) above the killing platform to funnel drowned to fall into the drop shaft and onto the killing platform
- A spawning platform at least 24 blocks above the killing platform

### Preparation
Before starting, you need to collect:

- Several full stacks of cobblestone
	- If you can get alava bucket, you can make acobblestone farmto get an endless supply
	- You need cobblestone blocks not only for building, but for making stone pickaxes to harvest cobblestone from the farm, and to make stone stairs for getting around the top of the farm, as well as stone slabs to prevent mobs from spawning on exposed horizontal surfaces
- 4 to 5 full stacks ofglassblocks; this may be the hardest material to collect without a desert nearby
- A couple stacks ofladdersorscaffoldingfor climbing back up your farm if you fall during construction.
- Ahopper(optional, but makes collecting loot easier)
- Achest(preferably two for a double chest)
- A handful ofbuttonsorsignsto control water flow
- A stack ofslabs
- Twowater buckets
- At least 2 or 3torches

### Building from the bottom up
This climbing tower is built on top of kelp. The structure on the left is a small cobblestone farm.
** Climbing tower **
The climbing tower is your access to the killing platform in the sky. In survival mode, building over the ocean offers safety in falling, unlike building over land. If you fall, you just have the inconvenience of climbing back up.

The most efficient way to start the tower over the ocean is to row a boat out to a deep spot with kelp growing near the water surface, allowing you to build from the top of the kelp without needing to build your tower all the way from the ocean floor, and without needing to swim. You can also put a lily pad on the water to start building from. Or, with a bit more materials and time, you can build a sea-level path from your land base out to your build location, and start building a tower out of any material, as high as you need. If you forget some materials, simply jump into the ocean and replenish. You can build a ladder up one side as you build the tower, or if you have enough material and time on your hands, your tower can be a staircase.

** Killing platform **
The first platform you build from this tower is the killing platform, and this is where you wait for the drowned to fall from above, so the minimum altitude must be out of the spawning range to the ocean floor or nearby land.

In Bedrock Edition, mobs spawn in the range of 24-44 blocks from the player. In Java Edition, mobs spawn in the range of 24-128 blocks from the player. Building over deep ocean far from land allows for somewhat lower altitude. The killing platform where you wait for the drowned must be more than the maximum spawning range from any possible spawning location on land or in the ocean.

The basic killing platform has:

- enough space for you to move around
- a chest
- a landing block onto which the drowned fall; if this is a hopper, it feeds into the chest
- a half-block space between the top of the landing block and the bottom of the drop shaft above it; the half-block of space lets you attack while preventing any baby drowned from escaping.
- one or twotorchesto keep the platform lit, to prevent mobs spawning on it while you're away

Two views of the drop shaft, partially open to see drowned falling, although it works best completely closed off.
** Drop shaft **
The drop shaft is a vertical tunnel through which mobs fall onto the killing platform. The walls of the shaft need not be solid for the whole distance, it's enough to close off the sides of the shaft and leave 6 blocks of space open in the front, if you want to view the drowned falling. Drowned can drift while falling, so an open drop with no walls might prevent the drowned from falling onto the killing platform at the bottom.

The shaft doesn't have to be tall, but if you want to kill the drowned with one hit from your sword, ideally the drowned should fall 21 blocks before landing on the hopper in your killing platform. Make it too tall, and the drowned die from the fall, and you don't get any experience or tridents or other drops. If you make the shaft shorter, you just have to hit the drowned more times to kill them — up to four hits with a stone sword, which is also required from the flooded dungeon farm described above. One hit with a stone sword is sufficient to kill a mob that fell 21 blocks.

** Drop platform (if using Bedrock Edition glass roof) **
This is needed only if you are using the glass-roof darkness mechanic in Bedrock Edition.

This is a small room at the top of the drop shaft. The drowned fall into this room from the spawning platform above it. The purpose of this room is to create a measured distance for the drowned to fall, because the spawning platform is by necessity a lethal fall distance higher than the killing platform, and you don't want the drowned to die except by your own hand! So you must build a small platform covered with flowing water for the drowned to fall into safely, and be swept by the water into a 1×1 hole in the corner of the room, which is the top of your drop shaft.

One water source block diagonally across from the exit hole is sufficient. Place a wooden button or a sign on the wall just above the hole to keep the water from flowing into it.

** Spawning platform **
The water in the spawning platform must be at least 24 blocks from the killing platform, because mobs don't spawn nearer than 24 blocks from the player. Make it as large as you want. it can be as small as 2×2 but larger means more drowned. Flowing water is used to sweep mobs into a hole. A small spawning room can sweep the mobs to a hole in the side or corner of the room. A large spawning room, say with at least a 16×16 surface, would have water sweeping the mobs into a hole in the center.

(If you make the center hole 3×3, you can float a stone block above the hole with a turtle egg on it to attract the drowned to the hole, with trap doors around to make the drowned think there's a path to the egg. The turtle egg doesn't hatch when not on sand. However, getting a turtle egg requires a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, which may not be readily available to a player in survival mode. The farm still works without the turtle egg although the drowned are slower about falling through.)

Your spawning platform should be completely covered with flowing water to sweep the drowned into the drop platform room below. Ideally the water should just reach the edge of the hole, but if water flows into the hole, you can stop the flow with a sign or button. Your drop room below the spawn chamber should be configured so that drowned are swept into the drop shaft.

Cross-section of spawn room, with water sweeping mobs into a drop shaft to a killing platform.
The walls around the spawning platform should be tall enough to provide sufficient darkness on the spawning floor. In Bedrock Edition, it should be 8 or 9 blocks tall to guarantee sufficient darkness on the floor after the transparent roof is in place. In Java Edition, the wall must be at least 9 blocks high to accommodate a layer of signs and several layers of water (17 layers of water guarantees total darkness on the spawn surface). Place slabs on the top of the wall to prevent mobs from spawning on it.

One layer above the flowing water on the spawn platform floor, you need a layer of signs covering the area, to hold up columns of water above.

On top of the signs, place 18 or more layers of water to make the light level zero at the bottom. Drowned spawn in this water and drop through the signs onto the spawn platform. The deeper you make it, the more opportunities drowned have to spawn, especially in the daytime during which the top 17 layers of water are not dark enough for spawning drowned.

** Alternative spawning room (Bedrock Edition only) **
This alternative requires a layer of glass blocks and only one layer of water, instead of several layers of water. This works only in Bedrock Edition.

Make the ceiling completely from glass blocks, with at least six blocks between the floor and bottom of the glass. 1 block of stone wall (excluding the slabs on the top edge of the wall) should extend above the top of the glass, to form a shallow pool that you must fill completely with water source blocks (no flowing water). You can build a temporary infinite water source off to the side to work with as you fill the pool.

Using a glass-bottomed pool for the ceiling takes advantage of the fact that drowned spawn under water but not on transparent surfaces, so they end up spawning on the platform under the glass. The water attenuates the sky light by 2, and each block of space under the glass causes further attenuation. One needs at 13 blocks of space (including the glass) under the water for the light level to be zero on the platform to let drowned spawn during the daytime. Drowned also cannot spawn on bottom slabs, but using bottom slabs instead of glass for the bottom of the pool makes the farm inoperable. The bottom of the pool must be glass.
