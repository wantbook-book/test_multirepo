#### Pros
- All variants except for warm oceans containkelp, which can be used as an underwater "crop" for food.
- While warm oceans lack kelp, they are the only variant to generatecoralreefs andsea pickles, which are a spectacle.
- What variant you're in depends on what type of underwater mobs spawn. Warmer variants spawntropical fishwhich come in thousands of color combinations, as well asdolphinsandpufferfish; Cold (but not frozen variants) also spawn dolphins as well ascodandsalmon; squids spawn in normal and frozen variants.
- Dolphins, when fed fish, lead the player to a nearby underwater structure chest, likely a shipwreck or underwater ruin. They also provide the player with aDolphin's Graceeffect‌[Java Edition  only]or instant swimming boost‌[Bedrock Edition  only]that increases their swimming speed when swimming alongside them.
- Turtlesspawn only on beaches, but you can generally find them swimming around in the adjacent ocean. They often head back to their home beach to lay eggs, which can be collected with silk touch or observed until they hatch to harvestscutefrom baby turtles.
- Both underwater ruins and shipwrecks can contain valuable loot such as crops, books, paper, iron bars and nuggets, gold, and even diamonds and emeralds. However, their most valuable loot is the buried treasure map, which leads to a buried chest in a nearby beach biome. These chests contain more valuable minerals, as well as oneheart of the sea, which is the main component to theconduit.
- Drowned, while difficult, can sometimes drop nautilus shells (used for making conduits), ortridents, a weapon that can be used as a sword or thrown. It can also be enhanced with unique enchantments like Channeling, which calls down a lighting strike; riptide, which pulls the player along with the trident as it is thrown; or loyalty, which causes the trident to return to the player once thrown.
- Abundant supply ofink sacs.
- Ocean monumentsare found in deep oceans. This is the only source of resources likesponges, also one of place wheresea lanternsandprismarinecan be found, and can be used to create guardian farms.
- A good, deep source of water for fishing in.
- Fish can be caught with water buckets, allowing for the player to move them to their desired location.
- In factions or anarchy servers, this is the best biome so set up a base. You can build an impenetrable base under the bottom of the ocean or in the monument while nobody knows.

#### Cons
- The biggest problem with underwater activity is, of course, the lack of oxygen. The player must find a method for prolonged underwater living that best suits their needs, be it water breathing potions, air pockets using non-waterloggable‌[Java Edition  only]blocks,bubble columns,turtle shellhelmets with or withoutRespiration/ other helmets with respiration, or theconduitstructure.
- If the player wants to build above water, islands are sparse, usually small, and low on resources. Building anything with wood, such as a ship, is difficult due to the lack of trees, although shipwrecks can be dismantled for a good amount of wood.
- Transport in/on oceans can be difficult for early players. A boat or boots with theFrost Walkerenchantmentare recommended for above water, while underwater, the player can activate the sprint button to begin swimming, and/or can use boots with theDepth Striderenchantment.
- Guardianscan be found inocean monuments, which may be deadly to unprepared players.
- While no mainland/underground mobs spawn underwater,drowned, a swimming zombie variant, spawn fairly frequently anywhere underwater and in ocean ruins‌[Java Edition  only]. They can occasionally wield tridents, which makes them dangerous as they can damage the player from a distance.
- Nearby ocean monuments may cause one of the elder guardians to attack you with mining fatigue, preventing you from progressing due to this making early-game resources like coal taking too long to be mined out.

#### Useful resources
Water, dolphins, cod, salmon, kelp, sea grass, coral, sea pickles, tridents, treasure map, prismarine shards, prismarine crystals, gold, sponges, wet sponges, ink sacs and magma blocks are useful resources found in oceans and deep oceans.

#### Tips
- The player can wear boots enchanted withFrost Walkerto quickly transverse the surface of the ocean.

- Unless the player explicitly wants to live underwater, building on a nearby beach may be a better idea if the player is having trouble dealing with air loss or lack of resources.
- While drowned are the only outright hostile mobs, pufferfish can inflict poison damage if you get too close, and dolphins become hostile if attacked like wolves.
- Build a conduit to solve all the problems of underwater living. A beacon also massively boosts the player.

### 
Frozen ocean is an ocean with a surface completely frozen, including deep variants‌[Bedrock Edition  only]. Some resources are different enough than in other ocean biomes.

#### Pros
- Frozen oceans have icebergs on the surface, composed of ice, packed ice,blue ice, and snow. Blue ice cannot melt regardless of biome and is the most slippery version of ice.
	- Medium-sized iceberg (one without water pool or tunnel) can also be used as a starter house in the early game, by digging a hole in it and live inside it.
- On some occasions, a structure such as ocean ruins and shipwreck may generate inside an iceberg, which makes these structures easier to reach without diving underwater.
- Players don't need to worry about being attacked by drowned (especially one armed with a trident) since the surface on the frozen ocean is ice.

#### Cons
- Strays can spawn at night in the frozen ocean and deep frozen ocean, while polar bears spawn during day, which can be dangerous.
- Underwater, these oceans are completely barren with neither kelp nor seagrass.
- While being saved from drowned, unlike other oceans, frozen oceans also spawn regular hostile mobs, such as creepers, zombies, spiders, and witches (skeletons spawn in fewer rate). So strays are not the only hostile mobs found in here.
- InBedrock Edition, due to the surface in deep frozen ocean completely freezing, ocean monuments are less noticeable until the player getsMining Fatigue, especially if the player travels on ice, even when the monument under feet due to surface landscape.
- No dolphins spawn in the frozen ocean biome, which means if ruins or shipwrecks generate underwater, the player should find it manually or by fed dolphin from another ocean biome.
