### AFK stone farm
AFK design which allows you to put something heavy on your mouse and go away from your keyboard. After your pickaxe breaks, a new one is dispensed.

Redstone is not required in the short version. Hoppers can be mostly replaced with water transport. The water source is protected as it comes from a waterlogged block.

### Semi-automatic stone generator
This creates 24 blocks of stone at the press of a button. And because it runs by lava flowing over water, (not the other way around) you do not need to worry about the lava source block becoming obsidian.

Start by creating the structure where the stone is formed.

1. Find a place to build your farm. It should have a part that is exactly 4 blocks high and has at least 4 blocks of space in either direction.
2. In your chosen 4-block area, place adispenserfacing down on the ceiling.
3. On the floor below the dispenser, place two blocks on top of each other. The block to use depends on the type of pickaxe you plan to use.
	- If you plan to use an iron or diamond pickaxe, the blocks should be obsidian. Otherwise, you can also use an ore besides coal or nether quartz, or you can use a mineral block besides coal, quartz, or redstone.Iron oreandgold orecan be obtained without the silk touchenchantment.
	- If you plan to use a stone pickaxe, exclude iron ore,lapis lazuli ore,blocks of iron, orblocks of lapis lazuli.
4. Placefenceornether brick fence4 blocks away from your 2-block tower. These are the corners.
5. Connect the corners by placing fence or nether brick fence in a diagonal line toward adjacent fence posts.
6. Place water source blocks on the floor (not the two-block tower)
7. Finally, put a lava bucket in the dispenser.

You also need a redstone circuit to make the dispenser place the lava and then retrieve it. To create it, you must be above the future stone farm. The following steps explain how make a repeat circuit.

1. Place a sticky piston facing up.
2. Place an opaque block (The page "opacity" has a list of transparent blocks, which are the blocks you should not use.) on top of the sticky piston (the sticky piston should move the block. See the page "piston" for blocks where the sticky piston do something else if you're not sure).
3. Place someredstone dust. The redstone wire should connect to the dispenser. Connect this wire to a block with a button attached (Make sure this block is not directly above your future stone farm. This way, you can easily press the button outside the stone farm when you want to make stone.)
4. For the block on the sticky piston to transmit the redstone signal, there needs to be arepeaternext to the block facing away.
5. Place redstone dust in front of the repeater and set the repeater to a 4 tick delay.
6. Place a repeater facing away from the redstone dust. This repeater should face a different direction than the previously placed repeater.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until you have 4 repeaters. Make sure that none of the repeaters are facing the same direction. If done correctly, you cannot place redstone in front of the last repeater. It should still be a 4-tick delay, however.
8. Connect the redstone between the last 2 repeaters to another circuit, which leads to the sticky piston. Include 5 repeaters and set 4 of them to a 4-tick delay. Make sure it is disconnected from any other redstone.

Now your stone farm is complete. To make stone, simply press the button.
