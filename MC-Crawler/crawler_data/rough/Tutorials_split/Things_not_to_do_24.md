#### Not keeping bases away from griefers
When playing on a public multiplayer server, the player should build their base away from the spawn, and even better in a hidden area. Having a base near spawn easily allows newcomers to come in and mess with the player and their possessions. Players have less need to worry about hiding a base on a private server with their friends and on servers with plug-ins which protect player's bases.

#### Not hiding valuables well enough
If another player finds someone's secret stash of goods, there is a good chance for these items to be stolen. If the player wants to hide a stash of goods, the items should be well hidden and possibly even defended with traps. Or even better, use an ender chest as other players are unable to access it. Putting the items into shulker boxes and bringing them around is also good, but other players can still steal them if they kill the player.

#### Making large chains of hoppers for transporting of items without placing a dropper on top of most of them
This causes lag and makes the server much less responsive. A hopper with nothing on top of it constantly tries to suck up nearby objects, while one with a dropper or composter on top only tries to pull stuff from the container itself. Droppers and composters are ideal for this purpose as they are do not produce extra lag as furnaces do.

#### Breaking chests when moving homes
When moving bases closer to spawn, you want to gather all your items. However, the player should be on the lookout for others and shouldn't break chests or players can steal their content.

#### Doing extreme challenges in hardcore
Some people may ask players to try extreme challenges, such as no armor challenge, half heart hardcore, wooden tools only, etc. It is not recommended to do these challenges in hardcore, unless you created a backup or is experienced enough. If you are trying half heart hardcore, don't do it on a world you care about because it is extremely easy to die. If you are doing extreme challenges on a server because another player asked you to do so, you can usually reject the request. However, if you accepted, be sure to bring another person to watch and/or bring safety precautions (totem of undying, potions).

### Possible ban or real-world consequence
#### 
Admins and other players do not appreciate the use of X-ray mods or resource packs on their servers, as it gives some players an unfair advantage over the other players and may lead to punishment and ultimately being banned from the server! It is never a good thing to X-ray, no matter how far away the player thinks admins are because they never know where admins are and what tools they may have to catch rule-breaking players. If the server allows it, or the player is given permission on a server, then they may use x-ray mods or resource packs, as long as they turn off these resources when done with them.

#### Breaching server consoles
Breaching a server's console is illegal. A player who breaches a server console risks the possibility of arrest and criminal charges. No server owner wants their servers compromised.

## Technical
### Playing with high settings on weak devices
This can slow down your device and ruin the fun of the game. You are also more likely to make a mistake or not be able to fight off mobs or players.

### Playing worlds created in a newer version
Minecraft worlds created in newer versions may have a different data structure than older versions, and playing these worlds can corrupt them.

### Death loops
Be careful while using commands, especially with /kill.
If you make a repeating command block that /kills you, you get stuck and are unable to do anything.
If you get yourself stuck in one of these loops you must either:

- disable command blocks in server properties if on a server or realms
- use a program like MCEdit (for 1.12.2 and below) or Amulet Map Editor (1.12.2+) to delete the command block.

If you're on single player these only work if you are the owner of the said world. If not, it is hard to escape this, and you must ask for help.

### Possible death
#### Traveling near the world edge
In Minecraft worlds, there is a world border â€Œ[Java Edition  only], which prevents the player from falling into fake chunks. However, the environment near this edge affects players, just as they did in the past. Huge lag spikes may occur, paintings and various textures become distorted, and entities spawn oddly all of which hindering the player's chances of survival. Not only that, the lava textures could become lopsided and thus the player could unknowingly step into lava because it becomes unnoticeable particles. Worst of all, if someone moves the world border, when the player is near the edge, then they cannot escape quickly and may die of damage from the world border. Sometimes, TNT can become an entity at another location then it was primed and could blow up things which the player does not expect.

In Bedrock Edition, there is no world border, but instead a place called the Stripe Lands but the farther out you go from spawn, the greater the chance of you falling into the void due to block hitboxes not being rendered correctly, especially in the Stripe Lands.  Also, many of the problems from venturing far from spawn in a world that apply to Java Edition may also apply to Bedrock Edition.

### Possible crash
#### Updating certain superflat worlds
If the player tries to build on a snow layer in a superflat world, the snow updates and begins destroying itself, which may destroy all the snow layer blocks for the entire rendered area.
