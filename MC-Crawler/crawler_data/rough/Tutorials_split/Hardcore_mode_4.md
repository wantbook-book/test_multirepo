### Overworld Exploration
Duration: 1–8 hours

At this point, most of the necessary supplies should already be acquired, including 15 bookshelves. Pick a direction and set off. Wolves are often worth the bones, so recruit any that are nearby.

Remember, villages provide good combat and survival supplies. Loot one if possible, but finding them can be somewhat difficult. Trading with the villagers can provide powerful items, even enchanted diamond armor and weapons.

At this point there are two main goals: ender pearls and experience. Also, it is helpful to have a chicken farm at this point, because feathers are needed to make arrows. Also, stay stocked on food and wood. In the night, be constantly on the move. Search for endermen while killing any threatening mobs or a safer alternative would be to trade ender pearls with cleric villagers. Also, kill as many phantoms as you can and make at least 6 extended slow falling potions. After accumulating levels, enchant weapons and tools:

- Bow(20 EXP levels). Infinity is helpful, but it is rare (10% chance).Poweralso helps.
- Sword(30 EXP levels). The most useful enchantment isSharpness.Fire Aspectis useless against most Nether mobs (exceptPiglinsandHoglins), but is useful in the End because endermen become neutral while burning. ‌[Java Edition  only]

Plan to collect 16-20 ender pearls and turn them into eyes of ender. Remember to be conservative while using them, as sometimes they break when thrown and sometimes they won't. After locating the End portal, dig a staircase carefully downward. Once inside the stronghold, break the silverfish spawner and get any loot you can find. Secure a shelter near the portal to prepare for the End. Linking nether portals to the stronghold can be helpful, so you can get quick access from your base.

### The End
Duration: 10–40 minutes

Note: If you run out of anything necessary to kill the dragon, it is essentially game over as there is no way to enter the overworld without dying. You can never over-prepare, since you only get one life.

These items are recommended for the End:

- Diamond or Netherite sword, a pickaxe, a bow and full diamond armor. Enchant any non-enchanted tools. Go for at least Protection III on the armor, at least Sharpness III on the sword, and at least Power III on the bow. The pickaxe can have lower-tiered enchantment levels, but it is recommended to use at least Efficiency III on it so that it destroys the iron bars that surround some of theend crystalsfaster.
	- Make sure that all equipment has as much durability as possible. Make sure that nothing breaks in the middle of the battle.
- At least a stack ofarrows, unless using an Infinity bow, then only one arrow is needed.
- At least a stack of high saturation food, suchsteakorcooked porkchops.Golden carrotsare even better, but more expensive.
- A decent amount ofobsidian, to use for building. This can also be used to block explosions when she is perched and you use beds.
- Two water buckets to distract endermen. Water buckets can also be used to break a fall in a pinch.
- Beds and respawn anchors may be a good idea for killing the ender dragon, as they explode when the player right clicks them in the End. Be careful about getting damaged.
	- Explosion damage renders from the player's feet, so try to keep the bed/respawn anchor at eye level, or place a block between you and the bed/respawn anchor.
	- You could theoretically use the dragon's crystals against it. If exploded while healing, the dragon takes ten damage points.
- Multiple Golden Apples, or at least one Enchanted Golden Apple.
- Various different potions, such as regeneration and strength, swiftness, etc. If you want to conserve inventory space, you can make these into regeneration II and strength II, but beware that these last much shorter.
- A good supply of ender pearls. These can be used if the obsidian spawn platform is not connected to the main end island, and if the dragon knocks you high into the air and cause lethal fall damage or into the void, you can teleport back to the island.
- At least 3 extended slow falling potions. Apply slow falling before the fight, and apply it during the fight if it wears off. The ender dragon's attacks inflict a heavy amount of knockback, flinging players high up into the air or off the island. Slow falling negates the effects of fall damage, allowing you to fall back down safely. If you get knocked off the island, slow falling can be used to glide back to the island.
- A carved pumpkin, since endermen do not turn hostile if you are wearing one. Switching to third-person point of view removes the obstructed vision carved pumpkins cause when worn. Beware that when wearing a carved pumpkin instead of a helmet, you have less armor points and are not affected by any enchantments on the helmet.
- A spyglass. The spyglass is useful for tracking the dragon's location and you can also use it to zoom in on the crystals you have not broken.
- Some flint, sticks, and feathers, in case you are not using an infinity bow and happen to run out of arrows.
- A totem of undying, it can save you from dying, unless you are knocked into the void.

Once you gather yourself and organize your inventory, jump into the portal and be ready for battle.
Upon entering the End, the first task is to take out end crystals, because they heal the dragon. Use arrows (or snowballs) to remove all the towers, while avoiding the Ender Dragon. If you can't avoid her
before taking out the crystals, don't hesitate to attack to prevent being blown or knocked off the island.

Try and use your beds and respawn anchors to your advantage. When you see the dragon perch, let it perch, then rush in and hit the dragon. The dragon takes 50 damage before it flies off, so deal just enough damage so that the dragon won't fly off. Then, trigger your explosives to kill or weaken the dragon.

- The speedrunner's method of killing the dragon (one cycling and zero cycling) are viable but not recommended for beginners.

While doing all this, make sure not to look at any endermen. It is much harder to fight the Ender Dragon while endermen are also attacking. If you have trouble looking at endermen, wear a pumpkin head and use a texture pack to remove the pumpkin head overlay.

Once all the end crystals are destroyed, take aim at the Ender Dragon, once again avoiding looking at the endermen. If the dragon knocks you into the air, quickly drink a slow falling potion. Keep moving until the Ender Dragon is defeated. Gather the experience orbs, and enter the portal to see the credits, then return to the Overworld.

Congratulations! You beat hardcore!
