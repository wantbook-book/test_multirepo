### Mushroom house
Materials

- A mushroom (Either kind works)
- Some bone meal

Description

Using a red huge mushroom, you can quickly make a tent to spend the night in. When you dismantle the shelter later by mining the mushroom blocks you can get more mushrooms that you can use to make more mushroom houses later, or some mushroom stew to eat.

Location

Pretty much anywhere flat. Or use a mushroom found in a swamp ‌[Bedrock Edition  only] or dark forest biome and skip planting.

Construction

For a red mushroom tent, make sure there is plenty of flat space around, dig a 1-block deep hole in the ground, plant the mushroom in it, and use bonemeal on it. Be sure to stand only one block away so you will not be suffocated when it grows. Then, put a torch on the stem, and wait until morning, then, dig yourself out. If you do not dig a hole for the mushroom, there is a chance that the mushroom may leave a 1-block high gap that spiders can fit through, or sometimes even a 2-block high gap, just fill it in with dirt.

For a brown mushroom tower, just plant the mushroom and fertilize it. No need to dig the hole. Then, pillar jump to the top with dirt or sand, or to make it spider proof, place ladders up the stem and a hatch to stop monsters.

If you grow multiple mushrooms on top of each other, you can create a tower; see below.

### Mushroom tower
- A mushroom tower waystation with cobblestone extensions

Description

For extra security and visibility, why not make your mushroom into a tower? Stacking both red and brown giant mushrooms can make a great instant landmark/safe haven while traveling (especially in forests or mountainous areas) by growing 3-5 giant mushrooms on top of each other.

Materials

- 3-5 mushrooms
- Bonemeal
- Torches
- Dirt
- Lots of ladders

Location

A space with nothing above it for 12-15 squares, or the mushroom won't grow.

Construction

When it's dark enough, plant a mushroom in a space with nothing above it, use bonemeal to enlarge, put a ladder on the stem, punch one hole at the top of the ladder. Put a square of dirt directly above the stem and repeat earlier steps two to three times. Since nearly any type of block or useful item can be placed on top of a mushroom safely, a brown mushroom can be easily used as a waystation, with torches to prevent enemy spawning and to aid in visibility, beds to sleep in, as well as chests and crafting table/furnaces. The extremely fast process can be used to escape enemies at sundown. Red mushrooms are best used as a visible landmark, but can be expanded using dirt or cobblestone to use as a waystation as well. 

Pros and cons

- Pro: If you like having tall structures or skyscrapers this can be used for it to be more resource friendly.
- Pro: If you use brown mushrooms, it will always be in a flat circle.
- Pro: You can easily top your tower off with a sphere if you use a red mushroom on top.
- Pro: Safe from skeleton archers. (Watch out for creepers hanging around the base of the mushroom.)
- Con: Quite fragile (mushroom blocks have low blast resistance and hardness)
- Con: Requiresbone mealand mushrooms which can be a bit hard to obtain.
- Con: Not enderman proof as they can teleport up to your shelter and may "steal" your walls/floor. (add a roof above the top mushroom to prevent the first problem)

Extras

- Bed
- Crafting Table
- Chest
- Furnace, especially if built by a mine as a landmark/waystation
- Torches
- Trapdoor
- More mushrooms

### Tree Home
No, not a tree house. A proper tree home.

Materials

- A tree
	- or a sapling and bonemeal (for larger trees, use 4 saplings in a 2×2 grid)
- Building blocks for the walls, like wooden planks
- Torches for lighting

Description

Very similar to a mushroom shelter, only using an oak or birch tree instead. Find any regular tree (or grow one by planting a sapling and using bonemeal on it, for larger trees, use 4 saplings in a 2×2 grid), and surround the area around the tree so that the leaves become a roof. Then, mine the log in the center to make space and gain some wood, but leave at LEAST 1 log in the tree to keep the leaves alive. This also has the advantage of telling you the time of day on the "Fancy" graphics option and getting you some wood for the first day. Here's how:

After
































































Location

Preferably a forest biome.

### Emergency Treehouse
Materials

- About 5 dirt or sand.

Description

Find a tree (the bigger the better, but more costly) and pillar jump up on it. This is a great nomadic shelter, as it takes seconds to build and has a nice view of the outdoors and you can shoot monsters down from it. The biggest drawback is the inability to mine, so a cliff-side cave or cave shelter may be preferable.

Location

A jungle biome, in a tree. Jungle trees can grow to be the tallest trees in the game. Craft some ladders and make your way to the top.

### Compact
Materials

- A handful to About a stack and a half (80-96) of planks (or dirt, but planks are better).

Description

Stand where you are right now, and make sure the 5×5 space around you isn't occupied. Right after you check, imagine you are an enchantment table, and place the dirt blocks/planks as if they were bookshelves. Repeat this until you have some walls that are 4 blocks high and you used up exactly 60 blocks of material. With your remaining material, build the ceiling. This method gives you a 3×3×3 space- that means you have plenty of space to do a lot, and not big enough for ghasts to spawn in the Nether.

Location

Anywhere, but not suitable for rough biomes, such as badlands (mesa) and extreme hills. Preferably plains or a desert.
