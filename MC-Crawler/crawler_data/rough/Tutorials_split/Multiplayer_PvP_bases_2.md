#### Passive
- You have a ton of dirt, but that's nowhere near good enough for a wall. At a minimum, you want multiple layers of cobblestone.
- Now's a good opportunity to start ashaft mineor even aquarry. If you want a self-building wall, make sure to get at least 4 stacks of redstone and a couple of stacks of iron to build the pistons and wiring necessary.
- Obsidian may take a long time to obtain, but it will be worth it. If you don't have diamond tools you can use buckets of lava and pour water on them where you want them to be placed in a technique called molding. If you have the area claimed, obsidian walls are practically impenetrable through the use of TNT or trying to dig through, (with the exception ofwithers, if the server has not disabled them) unless a plugin on the server has changed it.
- Another trick for your walls is to putsandorgravelinside them. This will make them somewhat self-repairing as if someone attempts to blow a hole in your wall, or dig through it, the sand or gravel will keep falling down and replacing the ones they break. It won't stop them, but it might delay them long enough for you to scramble to activate your defenses.
- Try to decide whether to useobsidianorcobblestonefor the defenses. Obsidian is stronger, but cobble is easier to obtain, so you can get more layers. Also, most servers will have a plugin that allows obsidian to be broken byTNT. (4-5 is the general amount it needs.)
- A better way to make your base a bit more TNT-proof is to add a shield of either water or lava surrounding your base, as TNT doesn't damage nearby blocks when submerged in either liquid. On the other hand, watch out for those hybrid cannons.
- It is possible to make regeneratingcobblestonewalls, using lava and water to make an infinite cobblestone generator in the shape of a wall. Hybrid cannons, however, can breach these kinds of walls.

#### Active
- Minefields are a good idea. Get a bunch of stone, build a load ofpressure plates, and place them all around your base. You can make a fake minefield (it is also good for spotting invisible players), if you aren't planning on making that much TNT to bury in the ground. It will be a great bluff as the mere thought of that many explosives under their feet will scare away just about anyone, and they will never know that it was fake. If you do go putting TNT under the ground, it's recommended that you surround it with water. It will still damage entities but won't make big craters in your base. Attaching observers to the TNT can activate it if a player attempts to disable it.
- Dispensers with arrows or fire charges can be hooked to pressure plates or tripwires to weaken or even kill your enemies without you lifting a finger, but ensure that these dispensers aren't directly connected to your base—remember, dispensers can also be used to light and dispense TNT.
- If you're expecting an imminent and immediate raid, scouting nearby areas for enemy cannons might be a good idea, as the owners might be offline. If they're unclaimed, claim them to avoid having the raiders come back and raid your base, and dismantle them. If they're claimed, try to blow them up before the raiders come back, or (if you're good at PVPing) wait until the raiders come back online and kill them to overclaim their cannon.
- Defensive TNT cannons atop your base might be a good idea if your base happens to be aboveground. Getting rid of those pesky claimed enemy cannons outside your base would be made a whole lot easier. Just don't give raiders direct access to these cannons of yours by loading them beforehand.
- A trapped Wither can be used as an active defense, as although it is unable to break out of the area, it is able to shoot at any passing players.

#### Hybrid
- Cactuscan be a hybrid defense in themselves: They work as both an active defense by pricking anyone who comes too close, and a passive defense by acting as an obstacle or barrier if you set them up that way.
- Cobwebs can be put over a hole with lava directly beneath it to catch and burn players.
- Hybrid designs are a matter of creativity and ingenuity. You can experiment and find new combinations and there are just about infinite ways to combine and defend.

### Getting Ready For the Rest of Forever
Time: ???

At this point, you've gotten past the limits of this guide. Your adventure to be the top dog is up to you now. If you still don't know where to go, then some suggested steps are:

- Expand your mine and keep hoarding diamonds and iron.
- Use your spare cobblestone to make an experience farm.
- Sell the spare stuff you don't need instead of letting it clog up your storage space.
- Create a faction armory with at least 1 reserved set of armor and weapons for each member.
- Create a grinder for your base.
- Enlarge your base as you invite more members and gain more power.
- Recruit people into your faction to speed the process up as well as improve defensibility, but be careful whom to invite.
- Pick a side in whatever the large conflict is to gain stronger allies and to have someone to fight.

Total time spent in part II: 2-8.5 hours

## II. The Flying Base
So, you want your base high in the sky. Well, there are some pros and cons to this idea.

PROS

- People will strain their eyes trying to see your fortress.

- If someone tries to get inside via a pillar, you can snipe them off and probably terminate them, or make them dodge lava "raindrops".

- If it's well lit, don't expect attacks from interfering mobs.

- if made out of chests and trapped chests, it is (almost) completely undetectable without a hacked client. On the other hand, you might want to create a few defenses for your base.
- People don't look upward as much as they look forward and around, unless they're adventuring and want to keep track of the time.
- Raiders will have to use up lots of scaffolding to build a cannon outside your base.

CONS

- You won't be able to have easy access to ashaft mineor aquarry.

- One wrong step while patrolling the exterior means essentially certain death and an emptied inventory.

- It may be pretty easy to see if you look at it right, unless you squeeze up against the skycap.

- There will be a huge shadow under your base, so someone right under it will know what's going on.
- Liquid shields are very hard to make.
- Scaffolding andender pearlsare commonly used to assault a sky base.
- There are TNT cannons designed to shoot vertically to crush sky bases. To solve this problem, cover your floor with obsidian.
