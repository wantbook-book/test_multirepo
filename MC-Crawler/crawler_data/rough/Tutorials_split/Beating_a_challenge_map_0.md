## Useful things to know
Challenge maps can include a variety of difficult obstacles. Here are some tips that can be handy when completing a challenge map:

### Damage
Main articles: Damage and Enchantments
Mobs become easier to kill when you know how many hits they take with your weapons. It's also good to know how much damage a weapon does if you need to know which one of your weapons is the strongest.

| Weapon Damage      |                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name               | Damage Dealt                                                                                                      |
|                    | 4                                                                                                                 |

| Sharpness          | Damage is increased by 1to 3.                                                                                     |

| Fire Aspect        | 3of fire damage with Fire Aspect I, 7of fire damage with Fire Aspect II.                                          |

| Flame              | 4of fire damage.                                                                                                  |

A weapon made with a not-so-good material that has a high enchantment is better than an unenchanted weapon made with a good quality material. For example, a wooden sword enchanted with Sharpness IV does more damage than an unenchanted iron sword.

### Fighting mobs
Many challenge maps have mobs that the player must fight. Different tactics should be used for different circumstances.

#### Large groups of mobs
If there are several mobs in a group, it is best to walk backward, away from the group. If there is a creeper within the group, let it explode, killing most of the mobs within the group. However, make sure to be far enough away to avoid explosion damage.

#### Mobs with less health
Mobs with less health generally mean any type of mob with 10 or fewer hearts, such as zombies or magma cubes. If you can, build a barricade around yourself, which prevents them from getting inside. Take them out by bow, even in close range.

#### Skeletons
Try and use your bow if you don't have at least a 3-hit kill weapon. Skeletons attempt to knock back players in close range by firing arrows quickly. Skeletons do not notice the player if at least 16 blocks away, so it's recommended to shoot at skeletons from this range.

#### Blazes
A potion of Fire Resistance is extremely useful to drink when fighting against blazes, as their fireballs are their only long-range weapon. If you get too close during melee combat, however, they are still able to deal damage without shooting fireballs.

#### Ghasts
Ghasts can be extremely annoying in maps, because not only can they break blocks and set things on fire, but they also often fly away from the player, making them hard to kill.

When on a challenge map, it's best to kill ghasts as soon as possible. To kill a ghast, aim for the body, or hit the fireballs it sends at you back to it.

Ghasts cannot break cobblestone or anything with higher damage resistance, so you can use that to your advantage. Always build with cobblestone, if you have some.
