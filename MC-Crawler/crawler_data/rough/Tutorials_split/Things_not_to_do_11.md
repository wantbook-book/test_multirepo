#### Careless mining of netherrack
Note: This is true of any diamond pickaxe or netherite pickaxe with Efficiency II or higher, any iron pickaxe of Efficiency III or higher and any type golden pickaxe.

The player should avoid bringing highly enchanted pickaxes with them. The Efficiency enchantment is useful for breaking blocks quickly, but using it in the Nether when mining netherrack may lead to death. Netherrack is a soft block and high efficiency is not needed, because you don't want to mine netherrack so fast by holding the mine button that you drill out large quantities of netherrack quite quickly and dig yourself into lava pools or rivers. Also, netherrack has limited use and could end up wasting durability of the player's Efficiency pickaxe.

However, if the player has potions of Fire Resistance to survive surprise lava and/or falling into a lake or river, and wants a ton of netherrack, then they could dig a tunnel without much worry with an Efficiency enchanted pickaxe. A player without active fire resistance must make any nether tunnels at least two blocks wide with one side of the floor a block higher than the other, so that if the player does hit surprise lava, it is channeled to the lower side. The player should always stand on the high side of this type of tunnel.

#### Not bringing fire resistance in the Nether
This advice is more relevant for more risky ventures in the Nether, where the player is likely to catch on fire. Fire resistance can be obtained from several different sources before the player has access to potion brewing:

- Enchanted golden apples, which are extremely rare and only obtainable from loot chests in certain structures
- Being revived by a totem of undying, which doesn't last long and can be obtained only from killing evokers in raids or woodland mansions
- Suspicious stew which has been crafted using an allium, which only lasts for a few seconds
- Getting a fire resistance potion from killing a witch, at a low drop rate and only if killed while drinking it
- Getting a potion or splash potion of fire resistance from bartering with piglins, which requires access to the Nether

The most reliable way to obtain fire resistance is by brewing the correct potion. To brew any potion at all, the player must have access to blaze rods, which can be turned into blaze powder to fuel a brewing stand, so they must have fought blazes inside a Nether fortress first. From there, the main ingredients required for fire resistance are Nether wart, which can be found growing in Nether fortresses and housing unit bastions, and magma cream, which can be obtained from bastion treasure chests, killing larger magma cubes, or crafting with slimeballs and blaze powder (see below):

#### 
Horses are useful in the hilly Overworld, or flat plains, but the Nether is no horse paradise. There are many cliffs' horses can fall off of (especially in the basalt deltas), ghasts to shoot the player into a sea of lava, magma blocks and soul sand, and the place is one big cave. Players do not usually take a horse when they go mining because it is dangerous, and the Nether should be thought of the same. If the player must use a horse or donkey in the Nether they should take several precautions:

- Use a Fire Resistance splash potion, which can protect both the player and their mount.
- Usehorse armor.
- AvoidSpeedpotions to help avoid running into lava or off cliffs.

Alternatively, if the player is making a transport system in the Nether, they can create a pathway exclusively for the horse to effectively create a "horse subway" that travels extremely fast with the combined speed of the horse and the distance reducing effect of the Nether. This is less convenient for the player while traveling through the nether, but it does take much less setup than a minecart system which is less tedious and less dangerous to use, but harder to build.

Make sure the animal used can be easily controlled.

#### Forgetting to bring flint and steel in the Nether
Even if the player secures their portal, there is always the possibility for a ghast to de-light it (not destroy it, as obsidian is only destroyed by a player or the wither). If this happens, the player cannot return to the Overworld easily, which is why the player needs their flint and steel to re-light the portal. If not, the player would need to do one of the following activities, many of which are dangerous:

- Trick aghastor ablazeinto shooting the portal again, to relight it. This does place the player in harm's way.
- If the player has found anether fortress, they can kill a ghast for gunpowder,blazefor blaze powder, andwither skeletonfor coal, then craft afire charge. However, all these mobs are dangerous.
- Try to getlavato setwoodnext to the portal on fire so that fire appears inside the portal frame. Note that this does not work with crimson or warped wood.
- Flint and steel, as well asfire chargescan spawn inruined portalchests.
- Find aflint and steelin a nether fortress chest (or just iron, as flint can be obtained from gravel)
- Bartering withpiglinsfor a fire charge

If the player is trapped in the Nether, they can also kill themselves to respawn in the Overworld (provided they don't have a respawn anchor with too many charges left). It is advised that players place their items in a chest if possible first. The player can return to the Nether (hopefully with a flint and steel this time) to retrieve their items. The player loses experience by doing this.

#### Not checking your warped fungus on a stick often
It is possible to ride a strider in the nether. You need a warped fungus on a stick to do so. However, if the stick runs out of durability midway in the lava, then the stick turns into a normal fishing rod, and the strider stops moving where you want it to go and instead returns to its normal AI behavior, leaving you stuck in the middle of the lava ocean. You cannot dismount into the lava either without dying. So, it is a good idea to check your stick often.

If you do get stuck, you may use an ender pearl or a fire resistance potion to escape.  Alternatively, you can bring a spare warped fungus on a stick.  However, don't shift-click it into your hotbar, as pressing shift causes you to dismount.
