#### Zombified piglins

See also: Zombified piglin

If player hits a zombified piglin, this and any other zombified piglins within a 32 block radius become hostile (pack behavior) and charge the player if they are in sight range (16 blocks). These mobs attack in medium-large groups and unprepared players should be cautious of their strength in numbers.

Their hostile status lasts between 20–55 seconds in Java Edition and always 25 seconds in Bedrock Edition, but timer is ticking down only if they don't see the player. Additionally, an angry zombified piglin continues to alert all other zombified piglins in its range. Taking cover and waiting is advised if player is not prepared for fighting the horde. The hostility radius is centered around each zombified piglin that is attacked, not the player. This means that the player can attack a far-away zombified piglin with a bow without nearby zombie piglins becoming hostile (although this is not recommended). Note also any zombified piglins between 17 and 32 blocks continue to wander as normal unless the player comes within 16 blocks of them (or vice versa), upon which zombified piglins rush the player (assuming they haven't calmed down by then).

An attacked zombified piglin has a chance to call "reinforcements", which spawns additional zombified piglins (or rarely normal zombies), angry by default. This mechanic, in addition to alerting naturally spawned zombified piglins, means that it is usually very difficult to get rid of all zombified piglins in an attacking horse, because new ones keep coming continously, even if player has a strong weapon and kills them in few hits. Building a 3-block-high pillar is enough to guarantee safety from their swords, but attacking them from the top becomes harder, and baby zombified piglins are impossible to reach, so you would have to kill those with a ranged weapon.

Zombified piglins have 20 × 10 points of health and carry a golden sword, which may be enchanted, but they never spawn with armor. They deal 5 damage on Easy, 8 on Normal and 12 × 6 on Hard. Compared to the zombies that deal 4 damage on Hard difficulty, there is a considerable difference. Zombified piglins do, however, share zombies' natural armor (8% damage negation). Some zombified piglins can pick up items; if they can, any armor and better swords than their own are automatically equipped.

The best way to kill a zombified piglin is doing it in one hit, as that does not anger other zombified piglins. This can be achieved with:

- Strength I + stone axe + Sharpness IV + critical hit;
- Strength II + netherite sword + critical hit;
- Strength II + diamond sword + Sharpness I + critical hit.

However, as zombified piglins are undead, the Smite enchantment is useful against them. Stone axe (or better) with Smite V kills zombified piglins in one hit, without the need of criticals or Strength effect.

### End mobs
#### Endermen

See also: Enderman

Endermen can be provoked in two ways. Like other neutral mobs, they retaliate if players attacks them; they also become angry if player looks in their eyes, which often happens by accident. When provoked, an enderman opens its mouth and makes a loud sound. They can be dangerous is player is unprepared for a fight, but using right strategies, combat with endermen becomes much easier.

Endermen have 40 × 20 and deal 4.5 × 2.25 damage on Easy, 7 on Normal and 10.5 × 5.25 on Hard. Their biggest strength is the ability to teleport; endermen can also run fast. You can't outrun an enderman, but you can hide in a 2-block-tall hideout, as they are 3 blocks tall and can't fit in such hideouts. Note, however, than enderman have another unique ability, as they can pick up blocks around them, potentially damaging your hideout. A full list of blocks that endermen can pick up can be found here. Jumping on top of a 3-block-tall pillar in theory also makes you safe from endermen, but this is not recommended, as the pillar can be destroyed by them quite quickly.

Endermen are damaged by both fire and water (this includes rain, but not snow), but are immune to projectiles. When damaged, whether by environment or by player, an enderman usually teleports away. This can be avoided (in Java Edition) by trapping the enderman in a boat or minecart, as they can't teleport out of these vehicles. It is recommended to trap the enderman while it is still neutral, since its movements can become unpredictable when aggravated. Enderman trapped in a boat is a much easier opponent, but it still might damage you if you get too close. Endermen cannot be trapped this way in Bedrock Edition.

Emptying a bucket of water on the ground hurts the enderman without it becoming hostile to the player, although mob immediately teleports away. Similarly, lighting enderman on fire causes it to immediately teleport away, thus using a sword with Fire Aspect is not recommended.

Hostile endermen teleport away when the player closes in. When this happens in a small underground space, the enderman may teleport into inaccessible caves or to the surface. They do not teleport back to the player unless they move to an area that has enough space for the enderman to teleport back. On the surface, an enderman's tendency to teleport away when the player is close enough to attack can be used to keep an attacking enderman at bay. The player can also change to third-person view by pressing F5 (Fn + F5 on Macs) to make sure the player can't be attacked from behind because of endermen having a tendency of teleporting behind them.

One easy strategy to kill endermen is to hit one, then jump into a pond or lake. Stay in hitting range so you can kill it. The enderman cannot jump into the water to attack the player. This is a good way for an unprepared player to kill an enderman.

A less exciting but effective way of killing an enderman is by staring below their torso, preferably attacking the 'feet' of its legs constantly with a sword or an axe. However, due to their tendency to teleport when the player closes in on them, the player should either stand still while attacking their legs or move backward keeping their distance (should multiple endermen be in pursuit of the player). This can also be done by simply punching them (providing this strategy is done correctly) without taking a single point of damage, but could be considered tedious to some.

The player can wear a carved pumpkin as the head armor piece in order to stop endermen from turning hostile when the player looks at them. If you hit an enderman while doing this, the enderman doesn't teleport away (although it does become angry), allowing you to kill it faster.

One way to prevent an enderman from attacking from behind is to have your back against an inside corner. An aggravated enderman is then forced to attack you from the front, in your full view, and you can simply hit it with your sword each time it approaches, until it dies.
