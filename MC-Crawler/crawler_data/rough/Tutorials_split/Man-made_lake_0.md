## 
This is the most convenient way to create a two-block-deep lake. It's perfect if all you want is a little surface of water. Note: that the deeper the lake, the less practical it is to dig it that way.

### 
You can make a lake any depth with ease! All you do is dig out your lake. (i.e. 6 blocks deep and also a rise near the edges) Then you do 1 layer of dirt where you want the water level to be. Fully cover the lake with the one block high layer and fill/overlap with water. (Make sure water becomes fully still/settled!) Grab a diamond shovel and with ease you dig up the top and only layer of dirt as your lake fills with water. You can also add to an already made lake like this, and just add 1 layer of dirt blocks at water lvl and watch as the waterfall extends over your extended lake. Once again you dig out the layer of dirt once you've gotten the water to settle.

### How To
First, dig a one block deep hole and fill it with water. The size of the hole is irrelevant, as is its shape. You're already almost done, make sure there are no currents ruining your fun and then dig one block deeper. The springs of the first layer will fill whatever is under it.

If you listened, you should already be done, but let's say you want a three blocks deep lake. You dig again, however you should note that under water you do everything at a slower pace. The bigger and deeper your pool, the more it will be a pain to dig.

## Deep Pool
What you need to understand about water is that it can't create springs if there is no block under the would-be spring. That's the reason why lakes don't fill themselves when one infinite spring is placed up-stream. However, water floats as of now in Beta, and if there's a block between two floating springs, a new spring will be created. That is the basis of this technique. Both versions are viable, but this version is the most efficient block wise.

#### How To
The deep pool needs more preparations. First you need to dig your pool. Make sure there are no holes in the walls where water won't be directly above, this will cause currents and the point of all this is not to get currents

Secondly, set up rows at the first layer of your lake, one block large, two blocks deep (the length is determined by your pool) and separated by two blocks of nothing.
 = walls,  = rows (or blocks you'll need to Destroy),  = nothing,  = water

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Seen from above, the walls are as deep as your pool needs to be but the rows are two blocks deep


Next, place springs of water all along the sides of the rows. You're ready for the next step if you have a layer of calm water separated by rows of dirt or whatever you choose to use.

The  will become water in this schema


Finally, destroy the rows from the upper section down. This is important, if there's no block under, the new water spring won't form.

With the upper row gone, a water spring is formed

The top  are in fact water springs, the rest is water coming from those


Now you are done! Enjoy your lake! Notice that the schemas only represents the pattern you need to replicate, the size of the pool doesn't matter. As demonstrated in the schema, you don't need the side of your lake to be even, you just need to make sure every row you make is surrounded by at least two springs of water.
