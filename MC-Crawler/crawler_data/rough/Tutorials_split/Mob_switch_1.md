Main article: Nether portal § Chunk loading
Another alternative to the spawn chunks is loading the area with nether portals. This section will not describe how nether portal chunk loaders work; for more information, please see the article above.

The best place to store the mobs used in the mob switch is on the border of the 7×7-chunk loaded area: When mobs are placed in the 3×3 chunks centered on the portal, their AI is constantly loaded, which adds a lot of lag to the server. When they are stored in the outermost ring of chunks in the 7×7-chunk area, their AI is no longer processed, but they still count towards the mob cap.

To turn the mob switch off, simply turn off the chunk loader. The mobs will be unloaded, and hostile mobs are again able to spawn in the dimension they are located in.

##### Advantages
- Can be placed anywhere in the world, meaning it can be strategically built in an area not visited frequently by players, saving them from the lag, and preventing them from accidentally despawning the mobs in a lazy mob switch.
- Easier to turn on or off, as it doesn't involve moving mobs physically, allowing shulkers (and withers) to be used.
- Works in both the Overworld and the Nether, depending on the dimension the mobs are stored in. This makes it the only way to build a mob switch in the Nether.

##### Disadvantages
- Nether portal chunk loaders are banned on certain servers.
- There is a chance for the chunk loader to fail, especially during server restarts, or when a singleplayer world is closed and opened again.

### Choice of mob
As mentioned above, most hostile mobs are removed from the mob cap once they are marked persistent, meaning they can't be used for the mob switch. However, some mobs are an exception to this rule, and can therefore be used in a mob switch. They are zombie villagers, shulkers, wardens and withers.

#### Zombie villager

Normally, zombie villagers despawn like other hostile mobs do. However, due to the bug MC-182304, zombie villagers that have been traded with do not despawn, but count towards the mob cap.

To build such a mob switch, you will need a villager breeder, a job site block, and a zombie to zombify the villagers. Make sure to put blocks over the head of zombie villagers, so they do not burn in the sun (unless they are stored in water). 

A zombie villager mob switch usually consists of a large room to contain at least 70 zombie villagers. If built around the spawn chunks, there needs to be a system that pushes the zombie villagers in and out of the spawn chunks; water is usually the best method, as zombie villagers don't drown unlike normal zombies, and the water additionally prevents them from burning in the sun. Once the first zombie villager is put into the holding chamber, it is typically faster to move more villagers directly into the holding chamber, so that they can be zombified by the zombie villagers already there.

##### Precautions
- Make sure the game is in Hard difficulty while building the mob switch, so that villagers have a 100% chance of being zombified.
- Boats and minecarts can be used to transport the villagers or zombie villagers during the mob switch's construction, but make sure that they arenotin any boats or minecarts when the mob switch is in its finished state, as that removes them from the mob cap.
- Donotuse name tags on any villagers or zombie villagers. This removes them from the mob cap.
- Donotlet the zombie villagers pick up any items, as that removes them from the mob cap.
	- To be safe, once the mob switch is finished, do not break any blocks around the holding chamber, as doing so might risk some zombie villagers picking up the dropped items.

##### Advantages
- Easy to set up, especially if the player already has the infrastructure for breeding and zombifying villagers.
- Works for both the spawn chunk method and the nether portal method.
- Zombie villagers are the least dangerous out of all four types of mobs, as they only deal melee damage to the player.
- Zombie villagers are much easier to transport than the other three types of mobs.

##### Disadvantages
- At least 70 villagers have to be used, which can take a lot of time and food for the villager breeder to produce.
- Utilizes a bug unlike other mob switch designs, meaning it might be patched in future updates.
- The sound can be somewhat annoying, but this can easily be fixed by using resource packs.
