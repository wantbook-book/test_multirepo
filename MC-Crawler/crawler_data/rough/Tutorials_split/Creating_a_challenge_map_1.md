### Add a kick-death
If you want to make a map to frustrate the player, make people who play the map get kicked by a player with an optional reason. For example, use, "You are banned from this server! Reason: went to illegal point." When the player dies, they are kicked out of the game for 1 minute! However, note that this is very hard to do in vanilla survival, without the /kick command being hacked.

### Add a permanent death
Most challenge maps have unlimited tries to solve a puzzle. However, if you make a tripwire that sets a new spawn point for players and the players fail, then they need to re-download the map. In the fail room, add a large game over sign and a message saying: 

Unfortunately, you lost all of your tries to complete and you need to re-download the map.

Alternately, you can make a command block that prevents players from moving, as well as a command block saying: 

Game over. You must re-download the map.

This adds an extra degree of difficulty to the map. If you want to warn the players so that they can expect to re-download the map, have a command block say this at the beginning:

Warning! If you fail, then it is game over and you need to re-download the map.

Then players will be extra careful, especially in the "test your brain" test!

### Make dungeons
Making pre-made dungeons hidden around your map can give players a very fun time! Dungeons can be used especially when a player can go anywhere in a map, rather than on a set course.

### Add some fancy stuff
Use /give to "hack" stuff into your inventory. Monster spawners would be useful for some traps or funboxes (3×3×3 spaces with walls of spawners), or simply decorations. End crystals are elegant, but due to their obstructive and explosive powers, they can be used as sorts of obstacles the player has to safely destroy. (Check out the "Look before you Detonate" trap!)

### Make a boss
You can make a boss out of redstone and dispensers. They are a great way to end any map.

Also, you could spawn an ender dragon or a wither in a room. Just remember to use the command /gamerule mobGriefing false, so that the bosses won't be able to destroy blocks. Alternatively, add your own boss. Customize your own boss mob by adding extra data tags (see Tutorials/Command block#1.7 uses). Even better, create custom mods with your own made-up boss! NOTE: To do this, you must be able to use Java programming or data packs (see Tutorials/Creating a data pack).Also, you can download Mods To make bosses even better!

### Other tips
Checkpoints can be created by placing pressure plates, with command blocks underneath them. 

You may even want to have secret button. For example, a player gets given a bow and some arrows, and if they shoot a button, a secret door or path appears, leading them to a bonus room. It is ideal, though, to have obstacles in the way of the button, so take this into consideration when making the map.

Bedrock or barriers could encase areas where you do not want the player to escape from, and is a genius idea for spawn jails.

### Firework finale
When you finally finish the map, you can create a fireworks show for celebration. Hook up redstone to some dispensers, craft up some fireworks, and then let them fly! Alternatively, you could just add some diamond dispensers. Either way will look amazing, and are great ways to celebrate the completion of a challenge map.
If you don't want to use dispensers, use command blocks to spawn fireworks.

### Texture packs
Texture packs is a great way of making your world different. It makes it unique, and fun. If you want to make your own texture packs, then the people playing your map will really love it more!

## Puzzles and traps
### Ideas
#### Basic parkour
A parkour room, containing floating blocks over a pit of lava, that the player is expected to jump across, and a chest at the end as a reward.
Make a large room and put lots of lava at the bottom. Then, place down blocks over the lava, on which the player has to jump from one to another. Make a small alcove at the top with a chest in it, which is where the player must get to.

Any blocks sitting next to the wall can be controlled with sticky pistons to extend and then go back into the wall, to time jumps. 

"Tightropes" can be made by putting strings of glass panes or iron bars.

#### The Cakes Are A Lie
Place 5 cakes in a line over BUD switches for the player to eat. One of the cakes, when eaten, will push up a small chest area with valuable stuff. The remaining 4 will send the player into a very deep lava pit! If you want, you can have a riddle written out on signs, and have the correct answer on the correct cake.

#### 
Create a tripwire hooked to an arrow dispenser that one tripwire hook is on. The victim will start running, and then get pushed down a hole, causing fall/lava and arrow damage.

This trap is avoidable. If the victim runs fast enough and/or realizes, then the victim avoids the trap, but if you put a furnace facing in, the player might think that the dispenser is just an ornate tripwire dropping a prize.

#### 
Create a room with a grid of wooden and stone pressure plates. Only some plates are safe to the player. For example, wood pressure plates are safe to walk on while stone ones push the player into the Void. This can be achieved by using command blocks to teleport the poor helpless victims to y=-64, or just by setting the command block to perform the command kill

A similar netherrack and fire maze as the one described in the text to the left.
