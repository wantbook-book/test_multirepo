#### Rivers and Oceans
Entering a river or ocean to heal is often a good option. Water makes fire, lava, and cobwebs impossible to use, prevents critical hits, and shrinks your hitbox, making offensive play difficult. Having Depth Strider on your boots is essential for this, otherwise they will easly catch up to you and hit you. Also note if either player has Respiration, since if not, you can keep track of their air bubbles and go under to heal when they need to surface.

## Types of PvP
This is an overview of various types of PvP. Further sections may take this into greater detail.

### Friendly PvP
Friendly PvP is when two or more players agree to PvP for friendly practice and training ONLY. Friendly PvP is great to play on LAN. It is the least hostile option for PvP as it:

- Avoids grudges.
- Stops property loss from thieving player drops.
- Encourages cooperation.
- Allows players to use any type of weapon without worry

### Organized PvP
In organized PvP, players agree on the circumstances of their fight, and then battle. The victor may be agreed to receive anything, from diamonds and emeralds to proven superiority to nothing at all.

This type of PvP can be highly competitive and players may need an impartial judge to enforce the rules.

### Unorganized PvP
This is when someone surprise attacks you without warning. Keep your weapons ready for this! This is mainly common in SMP PVP. 

If you have better equipment than your attacker, you will likely be able to kill them. At this point, there is no better time to give it your all. Utilize anything and everything at your disposal to destroy your opponent â€” any method that Minecraft provides, you should exploit. (Combat-logging, hacking, and other out-of-game methods are unacceptable except on select servers.) Always carry extras. You never want to be stuck in battle without a weapon. Therefore, extensive measures must be taken to ensure that equipment can be readily replaced in a fight, such as enchantments, extras, and consistent resupplying.

Press any advantages you can, and consider fleeing if you don't think you can win. There's little point in being honourable, and more point to staying alive.

If someone intervenes in your fight, and attacks the enemy, then you and the new fighter can kill the enemy. When that is finished, then you will fight the new opponent and possibly lose. Also, you may have a chance to "clean up" the player that won the fight between the 2 when they are low on health, or to escape while they fight. This is also known as "third-partying", or "janitor-ing".

### Kit PvP
In this type, 2 players spawn in a set map with an arranged set of equipment, thus the name of PVP. Practicing kits are important in learning the basics of PVP. And the kits can also be customizable depending on the server.

In 1.16+ versions, the most important kits to practice are SMP kit, netherite pot kit PVP and crystal PVP.

### Minigames
Minigames are typically played on dedicated minigame servers. Some popular ones include Bedwars (where each player/team has a bed that allows them to respawn if it is undestroyed), and Capture the Flag (where each team tries to steal a banner/wool from the other team). Many other variations of these games, and some more niche minigames, also exist. Each minigame will typically have its own set of rules, as well as a shop or class system (although this is not true for all minigames). To gain experience in this kind of PvP, it is recommended to try different kinds of minigames, and find one/some that you enjoy. Minigames are technically a form of Organized PvP, but are normally on a dedicated server.

## Practice servers
Servers are a good way to sharpen your PVP skills. Listed below are some of the more  popular PVP servers.

- PVP Legacy is a PVP server hosted in North America. One of its biggest advantages it offers over other servers is that it give players the ability to create and share their own kits. Featuring duels, FFA and teamfights, Legacy is one of the most popular 1.19 PVP servers. It's biggest drawback however, is that it only has one proxy, that being in NA, so if you live in places like Europe or Asia, players need to find another server.
- Stray is another popular server and is exclusively an FFA server. Though it only offer 3 kits (being Sword, Netherite Pot and Diamond Pot), players here are better fighters, so if you'd want to main Sword, Stray is a good server to start on. Stray also has 3 proxies, being NA, EU and AS.
- mcpvp.club is another decently popular server mainly used in Crystal PVP, though it also features other kits. It has 2 proxies in NA (East and Central) and one proxy in EU.
- Fusion Network is an Asian PVP server using 1.9 combat. It has FFA, Duels and even a Lifesteal server. The server is good for players living in Asia. They support Cracked accounts.
- CatPVP has multiple proxies and feature both an FFA and Duels server. It has NA, EU, AS and even an African proxy, making it good for multiple nationalities. You can also form your custom kits or use preexisting ones.
- Oceania Prestige is arguably the most famous 1.9+ Australian PVP server, making it good for people living in Oceania to play on, as they're typically forgotten in the PVP community.
- StrikePVP is another tierlist-verified server, hosting AS, AU and EU proxies.
- LOKA is an exclusive Diamond Pot PVP server featuring a special 33% damage buff making fights quite dangerous and faster. Due to the damage buff, the skill ceiling in the server is significantly increased compared to others.
- MetalMC is a server hosted in the Middle East, making it good for players who live there.
