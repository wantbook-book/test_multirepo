## Nomadic experience challenge
This tutorial assumes you are playing on Java Edition and only follow the basic rules. Most is same for bedrock edition. It is best to play this on hardcore mode.

### Your first few days
Like usual survival, your goals on the first day is to get stone tools, a temporary shelter, some food, and possibly a bed. After that, go mining for resources. If you accumulate lots of cobblestone, you can throw some of it away because if you make a chest, you cannot come back to get it. You want to get enough iron for a full set of iron armor, tools, bucket, shears, and an anvil and some diamonds for a diamond pickaxe and enchanting table. If you find a dungeon, you can break the spawner if you want because you will never come back to it. Take the loot from the chests and throw out anything you don't need. The best things from a dungeon are golden apples, enchanted books, saddles, name tags, and resources. Try to gather enough string for a bow and at least 20 arrows. For the next days, you must leave the area you used. Kill all passive mobs you see because you cannot build a farm. If you find a village, take some beds and raid the chests. Kill the iron golem(Note: For Bedrock Edition, make sure you have completely raided the place before killing the iron golem as you may not have a chance after your popularity reaches -15). If it is a plains or desert village, gather all the hay bales and sell the wheat to a farmer villager. Do some trading to get some resources and take any useful workstations, such as blast furnaces and cauldrons. Take as much as you can and don't worry about the villagers' safety because you will never come back.

### The Nether
Your next goal is to go to the Nether and get blaze rods and ender pearls. Make sure you have at least some armor and a weapon and some tools. Keep exploring until you find a nether fortress and bastion. Get at least 20 blaze rods from the fortress and get the nether wart as well. Find a bastion and kill the piglin brutes. Take as much gold, diamond, and netherite from the chests and toss the gold armor and weapons or put them in a furnace. Find a group of piglins and throw gold ingots at them and wait until they finish bartering. You need to have at least 32 ender pearls and 18 obsidian. If you get fire resistance potions, keep some of them. If you get soul speed boots, you can wear them. Keep as much items as you can and throw out anything else you don't need.

### The End
After you get enough blaze rods and ender pearls, build your portal using the obsidian and leave. Craft eyes of ender. If you have more obsidian, craft an ender chest to store more items. Use the eyes of ender to find the stronghold. Find the end portal room and destroy the silverfish spawner because you don't need it. If you can, explore the other parts of the stronghold and find chests. If you found the library, break the bookshelves to get books (bookshelves with silk touch). If you find a silk touch book and you have an anvil, enchant a pickaxe with silk touch to get the bookshelves. Before you fight the ender dragon, make sure you have these things:

- An iron sword or better, preferably enchanted.
- A bow, preferably enchanted, and at least 128 arrows, one arrow if the bow has infinity.
- A full set of iron or better armor, preferably enchanted with Protection.
- At least 32 highly nutritious food like steak, cooked chicken, or bread.
- At least 2 stacks of expendable blocks like dirt or cobblestone for pillaring and building bridges.
- This is required for all missions. It can prevent fall damage, allow you to climb obsidian pillars, and repel enderman.
- A pickaxe, iron or better is used to mine end stone or the iron bars around the end crystals.
- A few golden apples can be used for emergency healing. Optional.

Kill the ender dragon the standard way or use beds to blow it up. If you are experienced enough, it should be easy. If you use beds, you need a obsidian block on the corner of the bedrock portal pillar so you can place your beds.

Once you have killed the ender dragon, use a torch to pick up the dragon egg and put it in your ender chest. Your next goal is to get shulker boxes and elytra. The reason you have to speedrun the game is to unlock shulker boxes faster. This allows for easier storage, a big problem with nomadic experiences. Use a trapdoor or ender pearl to go to the end gateway and find an end city. Kill all the shulkers, preferably with a Looting III sword to get shulker shells. Take all the chests and loot. If there is an end ship, ender pearl or bridge there and kill the shulkers. Get the elytra, the two chests, and the dragon head. Raid more end cities for more shulker boxes. Discard anything that has curse of vanishing or curse of binding because you don't need it. Bring the anvil to upgrade your armor with the end city armor. Find a return gateway to leave the end. You will end up at world spawn or at a bed or respawn anchor that you used.
