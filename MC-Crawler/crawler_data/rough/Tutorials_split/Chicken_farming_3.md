### Realistic Chicken Coop
Put a Chicken on top of each Hopper. Each coop can house 6 Chickens. You can also switch the oak wood planks for stone or cobblestone for a nicer look depending on the biome or just your choice.

## Chicken farming and cooking
A chicken farm produces chicken products including raw chicken, cooked chicken, and feathers. Generally speaking, such farms combine a source of eggs, a dispenser to generate chickens, and a killing mechanism to obtain the loot from the mature chickens.

### 
A simple modification with the egg/feather hopper can be a dropper/hopper path pointing back to an egg dispenser under clock circuit pulses. As the dispenser creates chicks by re-throwing the eggs into the chicken area, a closed cycle for generating more and more eggs and chickens form. If left unmanaged, it's likely that the game would lag with a huge number of chickens, possibly before the maxEntityCramming gamerule kicks in.

A block of water laid on top of the air block controlled by air, controlled by a dispenser with a bucket can be used as a "kill switch" for obtaining cooked chicken. The down-flowing water stops the chickens from swimming up, and a top lid made of trapdoor would guarantee suffocation. Replace the block of water with a block of lava to get a cooked-chicken farm.

### Filtering out immature chicks
To filter out immature chicks which produce no loot, lay a block of lower-half slab over the hopper. This slab would stop water or lava from invading, while still allowing taller, grown-up chicken to suffocate or burn.

### Full automation
An obvious first modification of the full automation step is replacing the kill-switch mechanism with a mostly persistent source of death. Therefore, one should use the slab construction to wait for the immature ones to grow. However, this is not enough as this system kills mature chicken instantly and provides no chance of replenishing the egg supply.

The fix involves adding another dedicated egg farm. Just replace the input for the closed-cycle egg dispenser with a collecting hopper of an independent, normal egg farm, and you are ready to go. You may use a large chest to equally divide eggs produced from the extra farm for egg collection and chicken farming. You can control the generation rate by controlling the egg input. The point of the farm is that adult chicken in an egg farm will provide an endless supply of eggs. We can send these eggs to a dispenser in another farm where they get killed and turned into meat.

Example farm with 1/2 of the egg output used for making lava-roasted chicken:



|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Dispensers are connected to clock circuits.

Timing: a baby chicken takes 20 minutes to grow up; a chicken 5–10 minutes to lay an egg; an egg has some 1/8 chance to spawn a baby chicken. Some redstone controls on the egg-feeding hopper can be used to limit the amount of eggs put into the system in each cycle.

#### Example farms
- Frilioth’s Chicken cooker




- 
	- Frilioth puts the dispenser at the slab (chicken) level in the meat farm. This allows fewer layers of construction to be used and makes the design much simpler.
	- Another innovation is that the system is self-powering: by letting a comparator analyze the first (egg-carrying) hopper and an observer amplifying the signal, the egg-shooting dispenser can automatically fire (twice) without a clock circuit constantly working.
	- Instead of being constantly there, the lava is controlled by another dispenser to only appear for two ticks. There is no real benefit to this level of caution, before 1.14 at least.
	- Since 1.14 the lava destroys the cooked-chicken drops almost instantly. Frilioth has published aguide to upgradethe farm. The idea is to replace the hopper with aMinecart with Hoppersitting directly on a hopper while keeping the same slab mechanism. The minecart collects items much faster so all products can be saved from the flame.
