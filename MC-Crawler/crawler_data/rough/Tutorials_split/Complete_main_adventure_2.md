## Step 4: Boss fights
There are two bosses in Minecraft (three in Bedrock Edition): the ender dragon, the wither and the elder guardian.‌‌[BE  only]. 

### Ender Dragon
For a full guide, see: Tutorials/Defeating the ender dragon

Screenshot from The End in Minecraft Java Edition 1.9 with the ender dragon flying around.
At this point, you are in the End. It is made up of end stone and is filled with endermen. There is also a single ender dragon flying around, assuming this is your first time in the End in that world. Note that you can come back to The End at any time after you have killed the ender dragon, and it will not have respawned, if you do not respawn it. WARNING: You cannot get out of the End until you destroy the dragon!

#### Preparing items
- At least 2 stacks of cobblestone for pillaring up/bridging
- A water bucket
- An iron sword to deal damage to the ender dragon. Bring this if you aren't bringing beds to blow the dragon up.
- A bow and arrows (or only one if you have theInfinityenchantment on your bow.)
- Beds(optional) Beds can be used to blow up the dragon. Do this only if you know how to.
- Armor(at least iron)
- Iron pickaxe, to gather blocks.
- Ender pearlsto teleport from thevoidor to the main island if the player spawns on a platform floating above thevoid.
- Food (highsaturation, such asbeeforporkchops).

#### The fight
- Now you have to defeat the ender dragon. This is the hardest task, as an ender dragon has 100hearts(200 HP) and can deal a large amount ofdamage. You will see a pinkish-purple bar at the top showing the ender dragon'shealth. You must also be wary ofendermen, which are very abundant inthe End. Wear full netherite armor. The best way to damage the ender dragon is with a bow and arrows, so having at least three stack of arrows just for the ender dragon is recommended.Enchantingabowwith the "Infinity" enchantment removes worry of running out ofarrows, allowing you to focus on defeating the dragon. When the dragon gets low on health it will fly to the middle and sit on the end fountain. When the dragon is sitting on the end fountain, it is immune to projectile damage, so you must hit it with aswordto kill it.
- Watch out for the dragon's breath and fireballs since they can kill youextremelyquickly
- When it dies, it will burst into lights and disintegrate, dropping lots and lots ofexperience. Anend portalwill appear below its death location. (If you kill the ender dragon while it is flying it will just give off explosion particles until it flies over the fountain, at which point the death animation will play.)  Adragon eggwill also appear, which you can collect with apistonor other methods.

#### Finishing off the End
- Collect the dragon egg by placing a torch underneath or by moving it with a piston. Currently, the only purpose for thedragon eggis it being a trophy/decoration.
- Jump into theend portal, theend poemwill be displayed.
- Read the story, thecreditsand the quote. If you do not want to read all this, press escape, or click then click skip inbedrock edition.
- Congratulations! You have beaten the game's main adventure!

### Wither
For a full guide, see: Tutorials/Defeating the wither

#### Preparing items
- Get abowwithPower VandInfinityor better, diamond or netheriteswordwithSmite VandarmorwithProtectionIV andMending. Bring 3 stacks of arrows, unless your bow hasInfinity, in which case you only need one arrow.
- BrewpotionsofSwiftness,Regeneration,Strength, andsplash potionsofHealing.
- Potion of the Turtle Master, optional (to avoid many injuries)
- Totem of Undying, optional
- Jump into anether portaland find anether fortress.
- Slay as manywither skeletonsas you need until you get threewither skeleton skulls. It is advisable to carry and useLootingswords, as they increase the chance of getting a skull.
- Go dig somesoul sandorsoul soil.

#### Creating the wither
- Pick a suitable spot for the boss fight. It should be far away from any of your creations or buildings.
- Place foursoul sandorsoul soilin a "T" shape, then place two of the skulls that you obtained earlier on top. Do not place the last skull on top until you are prepared to fight.

#### Fighting the wither
- Thewitherwill be immune to attacks for a few seconds, when it is blue. After the health bar is filled up, the wither will release a massive explosion.
- It shoots wither skulls, both of which inflict theWitherII effect on Normal or above. The black skulls create explosions that are weaker than that of acreeper. The blue skulls create a special explosion, which can destroyobsidian. It is advised to bring abowas the wither flies around often out of the player’s reach. The wither can heal itself by draining the health of passive mobs, so keep far away from large groups of them.
- Once half its health is drained, an effect called Wither Armor comes onto the wither. It is represented by white stripes on the wither, which protects it from projectile attacks. When hit with asword, the Wither Armor glows red. This status also negates its ability to fly, so the arrows aren’t necessary anyway. When it reaches half health, just beware of its dash attack and wither skeleton summoned (Bedrock Edition). Also, its more challenging in this edition, due to double health.
