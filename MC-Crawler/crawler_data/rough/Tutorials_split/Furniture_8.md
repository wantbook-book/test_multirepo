### Sink and mirror
For the sink, you can use a hopper, a cauldron (full or empty), or a minecart (try the rail removal trick from above).

For a tap, you can use an item frame and place it above the cauldron. Then place a piece of blue concrete in the item frame. It may not seem like much but now you can turn the "tap".

You can make an acceptable looking sink and mirror combination by making a section at least 3 blocks wide of your floor material. In the middle block place your chosen sink. Surround the left and right sides of the sink with your wall material as well as the back at least 2 blocks high. Replace the block that is behind and above the sink with your "mirror". If you have it, you can use ice, otherwise use a glass pane and completely surround it with wall blocks to make it a full pane. You might put a water block behind the glass, just for "atmosphere".

A lever or trip-wire hook can be added above the cauldron sink, as a faucet. Also, for an extra touch, you can put up a banner next to your sink to create a towel! (Plain white banners work best, though patterned ones look nice, too.)

An alternate mirror is an item frame with the Steve mob head in it, or you can mine a 2 block deep hole in the wall, place a Steve mob head, then place a glass block at the front. (This is only an accurate reflection if you're using the default Steve skin, but if you use the command /give @p skull 1 3 {SkullOwner:PlayerName}, you can get a head with your skin to use.) You can also use a banner, which the pattern follows:

- Light blue base
- White base gradient
- White bend sinister
- Brown bordure

## Games room
### Chessboard or checkerboard
#### 
To make a chess/checkerboard, place a note block anywhere to form the table and board. You can build any type of chairs you like for the table. Notice how the note block looks a lot like a chess/checkerboard. You can cover up the sides with trapdoors for a table effect.

Note: This may not work with alternate resource packs.

#### Design 2
Note: Make this in a snowy biome.

Dig a 1 deep hole in the ground. Add two layers of snow. Put an armor stand there (preferable to make next to a wall). Put a chainmail helmet on the stand. Then, using a piston, push a block of quartz down until it reaches ground level. It should now look like a chessboard.

#### 
If you are a perfectionist and have the time and resources, you could also do this: 

1. Get amap
2. get any two colors of blocks (preferably white and black)
3. put the map in youroff-hand
4. go somewhere out in the open “away from your house”
5. Make the map
6. build a checkerboard pattern so that you can see it on the map
7. Optional (Adding pieces)
	1. Name banners of each color after chess/checkers pieces
	2. put them where you think the pieces should be at the point in the game
	3. click the map onto each banner
8. Also Optional (Getting resources back)
	1. craft the map with glass on acartography table
	2. Optional: destroy the checkerboard design
9. Put anitem frameon the thing you wanted a chessboard on
10. put the map in the frame

You can then clone the map to simplify the process and skip to step 9.

Notes: To fill the entire map, you will need 64 16×16 squares, 32 white and 32 black.

This process can be made much easier with Structure Blocks.

### Pool table
Put down 3×6 dark green wool blocks, with closed trapdoors for sides. Or, you can put down wood planks and cover them with green or lime carpet. Use fence posts to 'suspend' three jack o'lanterns in a row a single space above the table (will require temporary blocks to sit them on, then destroy them after the pumpkins are placed). Ideally, have faces turned in against each other. Then use string to draw a balking line across the second row of green blocks. Nearby you can have a chest with sticks, eggs and the oblong dyes (e.g.: lime, pink and purple).

### Ping pong table
Lay down 5×3 wooden slabs. At the two long ends, make a 3×1 fence. Cover the whole lot in green carpet/rug. In the middle of the long sides and at the side, place 3 high wooden blocks, with tripwire hooks on the inside of the top blocks, connected by string for the net. Cobwebs might work here as well. But you may not be able to get the green carpet in that case just use green wool.

### Pac-Man arcade cabinet
A simple way is to place two stairs, one on the ground, and one on top of it, upside down. Another way is to put 2 yellow wool (gold blocks work as well), one on the ground, put glass on top of it, and the other wool block on top. Put a painting (or an item frame map) on the glass, and you're done! You can also put two gold blocks on the ground, next to each other, put black wool on one of the blocks, put another gold block on top of it, and put white wool in front of it. Put a lever on the gold block on the ground to act as a joystick (Rails and crafting /tic-tac-toe tables work too) and you have a decent looking Pac-Man machine!
