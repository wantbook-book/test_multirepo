Evokers live in woodland mansions, which are very rare. Due to their ability to summon vexes and their fang attack, they are very dangerous in Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulties. However, they cannot deal any damage if the player is on Peaceful difficulty (although the player may still incidentally receive damage from an evoker fang if an evoker is trying to attack a villager). Evokers drop very rare items upon death: 0–1 emeralds, and even more useful, a totem of undying. If the player dies while holding a totem of undying, that player will not die, but instead, have 1, and quickly regenerate to full health.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

### Hoglin
Hoglins naturally spawn in the Nether, specifically in crimson forests on all difficulties. They become passive in peaceful mode and won't attack the player. They drop raw porkchops and leather upon death, which can be used as a source of leather, though killing cows is a much easier alternative.

### Llama
Llamas equipped with all 16 colors of carpet.
Llamas are technically tamable mobs, but they are also neutral mobs, as they will spit at the player, dealing 1 damage, if attacked by the player. They are the only mob in the game that will do damage to the player on Peaceful difficulty. However, this can easily be avoided, as llamas only drop leather upon death, which are also a drop from both cows and horses. Llamas can be equipped with a chest for storage, and they can be equipped with a carpet for decoration. Llamas will only spawn in savanna and mountains biomes. Trader llamas also spawn anywhere with wandering traders, even underground or in mushroom fields biomes.

### Piglin
Piglins naturally spawn in the Nether, specifically in crimson forest and nether wastes in all difficulties. They become passive in peaceful mode and won't attack the player, though they'll still hunt hoglins occasionally (thus, they may accidentally hit the player if they use a crossbow to hunt hoglins). While piglins drop nothing upon death, they can be bartered with, which can be used to obtain several normally unobtainable things in peaceful or in the nether such as fire resistance potions.

### Polar Bear
Polar bears are neutral mobs that spawn on Peaceful difficulty. However, polar bears will not attack the player on Peaceful. Polar bears drop raw cod and raw salmon when killed, as well as experience. These can be nice if you happen to have nearby snow biome, but otherwise, you can obtain fish by fishing, and experience by killing nearly any type of fish mob.

### Shulker
Shulkers spawn in the End on all difficulties, but will not inflict damage on Peaceful difficulty. Shulkers will drop shulker shells upon death, which can be very useful because of the fact that they can be made into shulker boxes.

### 
On high difficulty levels, vindicators deal the second most melee damage of any mob‌[Java Edition  only](first being iron golem). However, like evokers, they do not attack players when on Peaceful difficulty, but they will still be hostile towards villagers, just like they are on other difficulties. Vindicators have a high chance of dropping an emerald upon death, and they also have a lesser chance of dropping their iron axe which can be enchanted.

### Wolf
Wolves usually just ignore the player, unless attacked, in which they will become hostile towards whoever attacked them. On Peaceful difficulty, they will not attack players‌[Java Edition  only], similar to polar bears. Wolves only drop experience upon death, but they can also be tamed with bones. Tamed wolves will follow the player unless told to sit, and will attack any mobs that attack the player, or if the player attacks them, with the exception of creepers, ghasts, and horses.
