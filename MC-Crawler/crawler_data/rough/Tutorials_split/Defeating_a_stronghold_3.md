#### Accurate positioning
Main article: Eye of Ender § Locating strongholds
A more sophisticated method to find a stronghold is to make use of the exact functioning of the eye of ender, as well as the generation rule of the stronghold. An eye of ender points to the chunk where a spiral staircase, the first room generated in the stronghold, is located. The center of this entrance staircase is always exactly at the chunk coordinates 4, ~, 4, although the eyes of ender leads to chunk coordinates 0, ~, 0 (the northwest corner of the chunk). So if the eye of ender travels downward when standing at the northwest corner of a chunk, the player should go to the 4, ~, 4 chunk coordinates (or one block next to it, so they don't fall down the middle of the staircase) and start digging downward. This method requires a lot of practicing and sufficient understanding of the mechanics, but is so far the least time consuming method to find a stronghold, and is widely practiced within the Minecraft speedrunning community. Note however that this doesn't apply to bedrock edition as the eye of the ender leads straight to the starting staircase.

### Stronghold navigation
This iron door is flush with the wall, and therefore leads away from the entrance staircase. It is also at the bottom of a straight staircase which always generates downward from the entrance.
This iron door is indented into the wall, meaning it leads toward the entrance staircase.
While exploring the hallways of the stronghold, a few techniques can be used to help not to get lost. First, notice the placement of oak and iron doors. If the door is flush with the wall, the same way it's facing when you place the door between the walls, it means this doorway leads further from the entrance staircase mentioned above. If the door is carved into the wall, that means the doorway leads toward the entrance staircase. So if you enter the stronghold from somewhere other than the entrance staircase, it is recommended that you trace along the carved-in doors until you find a spiral staircase going upward that is not connected to a room above. This is the entrance staircase of the stronghold, and exploration from this point onward becomes much easier. 

A few things to keep in mind when exploring the stronghold:

- Doors flush with the wall always lead away from the entrance staircase, as seen on the right.
- Both spiral and straight (cobblestone) staircases can only lead downward from the entrance staircase.
- The entrance point of a five-way crossing is always the one opposite to the arch.
- The portal room is at most 5 corridors from the entrance, so if you have go too far without fiding the portal room, you are likely to be on the wrong way, so you should head back to the entrance and start exploring a different route.
- If you heard the sound ofsilverfishorlava, the portal room is likely nearby.

### Portal room
Keep exploring the stronghold's hallways until you find the end portal room. Collect any chest loot that you find. As soon as you see the portal room, run in as quick as you can, as an active silverfish spawner sits in the broken staircase that leads up to the portal. Kill all the silverfish in the room and destroy the spawner. You can also place stone brick stairs in the empty space to complete the staircase, which eases the walk up to the portal. It is also recommended that you quickly turn the lava into obsidian because silverfish could emerge from the blocks beside the lava basin and it could cause you to be engulfed in lava.

To activate the portal, simply insert an eye of ender into each portal frame. Some of the portal frames may already contain an eye. Once all of the portal frames have been filled, the portal activates and emits a loud, dragon-like roar, "reminding" that you are about to fight the ender dragon.

Since the trip to the End is one-way, don't even think about jumping into the portal until you rearrange your inventory so that your hotbar contains the following:

- Sword
- Bow or crossbow
- Pickaxe
- Golden apples
- A slow falling potion
- Ender pearls
- Food (a full stack)
- Blocks (a full stack)
- Empty bottles

Put all of the items that you don't need in the fight, such as the loot found in the stronghold, into your ender chest. Pick up the ender chest using your Silk Touch pickaxe. Make sure you are wearing all of the armor, but instead of your helmet, wear the carved pumpkin. It is also recommended that you place a chest with things like: a chestplate (any type), leggings (any type), a shield, and a sword. You can use these items if you die, however if you have the gamerule "keep inventory" on, you do not need these.  Holding the ender pearls, enter the portal when ready.

## The fight
### Entering the End
The hitboxes of the ender dragon. The green boxes are where the dragon can be damaged.
When you jump into the portal, you instantly get teleported to the End, giving no time to escape. When you arrive in the End, you spawn on a 5×5 obsidian platform. The platform usually generates on the surface of the island, so you can just walk off. If it generates underground, dig up to the surface using a pickaxe. If it is away from the island, throw an ender pearl to the island to save your extra blocks.

If you are playing on Java Edition, it is strongly advised that you press F3 + B as soon as you enter the End, which shows the hitboxes of the endermen and the ender dragon. Because the background color of the End is dark, it can be hard to distinguish endermen from the background, thus the white-colored hitboxes can help you avoid accidentally looking at them. The dragon's hitboxes are also shown, which can help you determine the areas where the dragon can be damaged.

Get to the center of the island as quickly as possible, and if you see the dragon diving at you, quickly jump out of its way. Drink a slow falling potion in case you get knocked off. Before fighting, you need to do a few things.
