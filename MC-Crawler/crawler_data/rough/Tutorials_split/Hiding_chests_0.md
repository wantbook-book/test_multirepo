## Introduction
If your chests are in plain view when you're in multiplayer, everything you have may be stolen, and you may never see it again. Ender chests are useful, but in many circumstances, you may have more items than the ender chest can fit, especially in servers where the ender chest space is made smaller. Shulker boxes are helpful because full shulker boxes can be carried around in your inventory, but shulker boxes are expensive and require rare items to craft. Also, if you carry an ender chest or shulker box far from your house, you would lose it if you die. Therefore, it's beneficial to know ways to hide chests to protect your most prized possessions.

Hiding chests only have a practical use in multiplayer because mobs and other entities don't have the AI to steal from players' chests. However, some players enjoy the secrecy of their valuable chests, even in singleplayer mode.

## Ways to hide chests
### Simple ways
Here is a list of simple ways to hide chests, which requires just a few blocks and don't include any redstone wiring.

#### Chest under chest
In the picture, you can see that a chest under another chest is opened, revealing goodies.
This is a simple way to hide your stuff. All you have to do is dig a place on the ground and place a chest there. Then, on top of it, add another chest, in which you put only junk. When another player enters your house, they see the top chest full of junk, and likely fail to see the chest underneath that (where you hide your stuff).

#### Barrel under chest
This is essentially the same as Chest under chest, but you place your items in a barrel instead of another chest underneath the junk chest. This makes it slightly easier to open and slightly harder to detect.

#### Door hideout
In the corner of your house, add a door. Be sure the hinges are at the corner and the handle faces away from the corner, so when you open the door, the side where the door opens to is blocked. On that side, add your secret chest! You may want to make the doorway look like, for example, a furnace room, so when another player raids your house, they open the door only to be faced with a stack of furnaces. As the door to the furnace room is opened, the chest is hidden from view by the door itself!

#### Door hideout v2
Some people, however, might know about the above door hideout trick and close the door. BOOM, Loot! Just to make sure they don't find it that way, you can try the above Chest-under-Chest trick or place your chest in the ground and put a wall for the door to block. Now, when they shut the door, they see a plain wall. If you still aren't feeling safe, place a block under with dirt on top.  

#### Double-bluff
A trapped chest could easily be a decoy, hooked up to TNT or some other kind of deadly trap. If this tactic is common knowledge on your server, placing your valuables in a trapped chest might be enough to dissuade potential thieves. The good part of this double-bluff is that it is relatively cheap and can be combined with any other hiding method. The bad part is that it relies on the thief noticing that the chest is trapped before they try opening it.

#### Minecart corner
Again in the corner, this is a great way to hide your stuff. Just right behind the corner on the other side, dig one block down, and add a chest minecart. From the corner, you can click on the minecart chest to open it. Be sure people don't see the chest from the outside! (does not work in 1.13)

#### Under dirt
Perhaps the simplest way to hide a chest. Put a large chest under two grass blocks. Make sure that it's in a spot that nobody would want to mine in, like next to a lava lake or under a creeper's crater. If the server has a plugin, set a home there; otherwise, put something there to help you remember where it is.
