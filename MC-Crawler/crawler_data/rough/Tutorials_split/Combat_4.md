#### Phantoms

See also: Phantom

Phantoms are difficult to kill as they have a small hitbox and only briefly swoop down from the skies to attack before retreating. They only spawn at night if a player hasn't slept in a bed for at least 3 in-game days (and if gamerule doInsomnia is set to true). Players can check how much time has passed since their last rest in their statistics‌[Java Edition  only]: if the "Time since last rest" statistic is greater than 1.0 h, phantoms can spawn. The longer the player has not slept in a bed, the more frequently phantoms spawn. 

After spawning, they fly around you and swoop down to attack. Outrunning phantoms is a rather futile effort, although with fireworks and elytra you can escape them. Instead, the best way to avoid being attacked by them is by going inside a house, cave, making a small hole in the ground, or sleeping. Phantoms are undead mobs, so sleeping or waiting them out until daytime causes them to burn in the sun. They are also affected by Smite. Stone axe (or better) with Smite V kills phantoms in one hit, without the need of criticals or Strength effect.

Phantoms are afraid of cats, so it's best to have one around you to prevent phantoms from swooping down.

If you want to kill them for drops or XP, stand under a tree or build a roof above you. When the phantom swoops down to attack, hit it when it is under the roof. The phantom tries to retreat, but is blocked by the roof.

If you are stuck out in the open with no method of cover, damage can be avoided by precisely hitting one as they swoop toward you, preferably earlier in the dice and/or moving backward to increase the window of time the phantom can be hit without touching you. A bow might be helpful in this, although phantoms are very hard to shoot, due to their small hitbox and fast movement.

Phantoms’ slow turn speed can also allow you to avoid damage by quickly running to the side around the phantom and even counterattack, but this is much less effective against large groups.

#### Vindicators

See also: Vindicator

First type of an illager. These mobs have 24 × 12 points of health, deal very high melee damage (7.5 × 3.75 on Easy, 13 × 6.5 on Normal, 19.5 × 9.75 on Hard), and almost always spawn in groups with other vindicators: in patrols, woodland mansions and during raids, which only occur when the player enters a village with a Bad Omen effect.

Since the woodland mansion has many areas where another hostile mob can hide, it is easy to be ambushed and swiftly killed, especially when entering bedrooms, their primary spawn location. As the mansion is dimly lit, it is best to explore using Night Vision or bring a lot of torches. Having another player with you also helps, if possible. Keep hostile mob sounds up, since vindicators make grunting noises while idle.

Having armor enchanted with Protection reduces the damage taken, but beware of vindicators holding an enchanted axe, as it can deal even more damage, sometimes killing unarmored players in a single hit. This is not a mob to be taken lightly, even late game. Even more so, when it is coupled with its allies, evokers, pillagers and ravagers.

In Java Edition, killing vindicators in one hit is possible only with Strength effect and critical hits. Some ways to achieve the one-hit kill include:

- Strength I + netherite axe + Sharpness V + critical hit;
- Strength II + netherite sword + Sharpness V + critical hit;
- Strength II + stone axe + Sharpness II + critical hit;
- Strength II + netherite axe + critical hit.

Blocking with a shield doesn't work, as vindicators have the ability to disable shields using the axe's stun function‌[Java Edition  only].

During raids, prioritize to kill vindicators over pillagers. These mobs become regular enemies at later waves.

#### Evokers


See also: Evoker

Second type of an illager, the shamanic counterpart to the vindicator. They have the same amount of health as vindicators (24 × 12), but behave very differently. They use magic fang attacks and summon vexes, small spirit-like creatures. Evokers spawn only in woodland mansions and during raids, in the fifth wave and above.

In mansions, evokers are typically accompanied by 2 or more vindicators. During raids, evokers spawn on their own or riding ravagers, in both cases surrounded by a large amount of other illagers, including vindicators. Vindicators charge you, giving the evoker time to use one of two its summoning attacks:

- Vex summoning. Summons 3 small mobs, which can pass through blocks. They die within 2 minutes and are limited by a binding radius. When fighting in a room with evokers, keep an eye out for vexes, especially their red glow when charging. They have low health, but deal large damage and can be very dangerous due to the fact that multiple summons can happen.
- Fang attack. It does 6of magic damage: this cannot be mitigated by unenchanted armor, but can be mitigated byProtectionenchantment. It can hit multiple targets and it cannot damage other illagers. Evokers use their fangs both offensively and defensively. When used offensively, they spring up in a line toward the player. When used defensively, the fangs form a circle around the evoker. Fangs can be avoided if you are constantly moving or jumping.

The best strategy is to simply kill the evoker as soon as possible, especially if it attempts a spell. Evokers can be killed in one melee hit in the same ways as vindicators. Another good strategy is attacking at a distance with a bow, if possible. However, keep in mind that evokers also attack when damaged, even if the evoker has no line-of sight toward you. Because of this, if you attack the evoker far away with a bow, it summons vexes and they charge at you.
