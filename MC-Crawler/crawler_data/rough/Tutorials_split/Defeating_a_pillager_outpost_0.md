# Tutorials/Defeating a pillager outpost
Pillager outposts are the second illager-filled structure added to the game, after woodland mansions. They are flooded with pillagers, both inside and in the surrounding area, making it a difficult challenge for any player to conquer it. Note that this can be achieved at any point during the game.

- To convert the outpost into araid farm, which yields a variety of loot in large quantities.
- For the challenge.
- To obtain thesentry armor trim, which is exclusive to this structure.

## Finding an outpost
Pillager outpost located in desert biome.
Pillager outposts can be found in any biome that a village can, and can additionally generate in all mountains biomes. Despite that they are often found next to villages, this is simply a coincidence, as the generation of these two structures is completely independent. The spawning of pillager patrols is also unrelated to the location of outposts, so do not assume that a patrol means an outpost is nearby.

## Items needed
Because a pillager outpost can be found anywhere, it can be hard to prepare. Ideally, a player should have:

- An iron/diamond/netheritesword, preferably enchanted with a high level ofSharpness,Fire Aspect,Sweeping Edge‌[Java Edition  only], andLootingif possible. Avoid using weapons enchanted withKnockbackas pillagers wield ranged weapons. You have an advantage if you can keep them close and force melee combat.
- Abow, preferably enchanted withInfinityand a high level ofPowerandFlameif possible. (Punchcan both help and hinder you because pillagers also use ranged weapons).
- Severalarrows, multiple stacks if using a crossbow or a bow withoutInfinity(InBedrock Edition, pillagers drop arrows, so this is less of a problem), and if you haveInfinity, you need only oneArrow.
- A full set of at least ironarmor, preferably enchanted withUnbreakingandProjectile Protection, or justProtection
- AshieldwithUnbreaking, or two unenchanted shields (note that pillagers with piercing crossbows can still damage you with your shield raised)
- Acrossbow, which can be used instead of or alongside a bow. If possible bring one withPiercingand one withMultishot, both withQuick Charge. Multiple required for machine gunner tactic (see§ Tacticsbelow)
- Highly nutritious food likesteak,cooked salmon, orcooked porkchop

Optional:

- Potions such asStrengthand/orthe Turtle Master(invisibilityis ineffective inJava Edition)
- Enchantedor normalgolden apples
- AtridentwithLoyaltyIII, and if wantedChannelingand/or one withRiptide(water must be nearby or you need manywater buckets), as another ranged weapon option
- Alava bucket
- TNTwithflint and steelorfire chargesto ignite it (these can also be used to burn the outpost down)
- Snow blocksand/oriron blockswithcarved pumpkinsto creategolemsto help fight (sometimes pillager outposts have targets with carved pumpkins on them, which you can use)
- Ender pearls
- Totem of Undying
- A tamedwolfand/orfox, preferably multiple, to help fight
- If a crossbow is being used, bringfirework rocketscrafted with severalfirework starsfor ammunition and a crossbow
- Amilk bucketto remove the bad omen effect one gets after killing a captain.

you could actually do it with just food, but if you are in hard/hardcore mode it is advisable that you take it with you

## Outpost surroundings
Pillager outposts typically have smaller buildings around it. These can be used for cover. If a cage has an iron golem in it, let it out so it can help you fight. If it survives, do what you want with it, such as using a lead to bring it to a nearby village.

## Tactics
### Sniper
It's possible to go around with a ranged weapon and pick off all the pillagers from afar. If using a crossbow, don't fire fireworks unless you're sure the fuse time is right and you're firing at a large group. Once the coast is clear, go in the outpost, deal with any pillagers inside, kill the outpost captain if you haven't already, and collect your loot. This tactic takes the longest.

### Blitzing
With good armor, this tactic can be effective. Run in with your shield and sword, blocking arrows and hitting pillagers nearby as you go. Run into the building, grab what you want, kill the captain, and leave. Once you're at the top of the outpost, you can use the sniper tactic to get rid of the rest if you like, or just leave. Ender pearls can help in this tactic. good players can also do it without armor.

### Machine gunner
This tactic is expensive and not always reliable but can work. Load your entire hotbar with loaded crossbows, get into relatively close range, and as soon as you fire a crossbow draw your next one. This allows you to fire multiple arrows quickly, but it is ineffective against large groups unless most or all of the crossbows are enchanted with piercing and/or multishot. Also, it takes a long time to reload all the crossbows, even if some or all have quick charge, so you may be able to do this only once. It can, however, be combined with the blitzkrieg tactic as you're charging in, as after you unload the crossbows you can equip a melee weapon and have a shield in your offhand the whole time. This tactic is ineffective at long range due to the time it takes to range the target is about the same as the reload time for a bow or crossbow or the time it takes for a loyalty trident to return. Overall, this tactic would be better for a single target with a large amount of health, like a ravager, ender dragon, or wither. Crossbows could also be loaded with fireworks for more firepower.
