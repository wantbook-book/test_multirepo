## V: Nether base
#### Pros
- Very well hidden
- Easy access to nether quartz, gold, nether warts, netherite and, generally, blaze rods.
- Strong mobs mean that players will have difficulty setting up TNT cannons around your base.
- Bedrock covers the top of the world, meaning you can choose to have an invincible roof (as opposed to the floor).
- Piglin trading makes an easy farm as they spawn in large numbers

#### Cons
- Very difficult to start off with, meaning you will likely be transporting large quantities of items from another base.
- Beds cannot be placed, as well as /home and /f home requiring you to be in the nether to work.
- Generally little access to wood and traditional ores, although you can find wood in a warped or crimson forest.
- Ghasts can do a lot of damage to an unprepared base.
- Zombified Piglins, or if it's big enough, ghasts can spawn in your base at any time.
- Water cannot be directly placed, meaning that TNT can wreak havoc on your base!
- Almost any player who comes will bring fire resistance potions, rendering fire and lava traps virtually useless.
- It is difficult to activate beacons in the nether, as despite the fact that the beams can now penetrate bedrock, you will have to clear a lot of netherrack in order for the beam to reach the bedrock layer. Also, if you are unfortunate enough for a lot of netherrack to be completely encased in bedrock on the top (which is rather common) you'll have to build them a distance away.
- Endermen might pick blocks off your base walls.

#### Construction
First of all, you're going to need a way into the nether. Get enough obsidian/molding supplies to make a portal, then make and hide one (generally underground). Be sure to claim this chunk! Then /f sethome next to it, and head on through. If it's a good enough place for you, keep going. If you're in a bad place (i.e. over a lava lake), then you should probably head back to the overworld and move your portal elsewhere. From here, there are three ways to go about your base (keep in mind that all the defenses in the world won't save you if your portal is in your base).

#### Traditional
Hollow out an area in a wall, big enough for however big you'd like your base to be (but keep spaces smaller than 4×4×4 if you don't want ghasts to spawn), then line it with cobble or obsidian. Afterward, skip to the next step.

#### Stolen fortress
Head to the nearest nether fortress and begin by walling off any corridors leading from the area you want your base to be. Then make sure any place you don't want blazes and skeletons spawning to have a light level of 15 (most easily done by covering the floor with jack-o-lanterns). It would be advisable to undergo obsidian padding. When you're done, move to the next step (after you've raided everything in the fort).

#### Under-Lava Fortress
Built mostly like an underwater base (see above), however, fire resistance potions are best used in place of water breathing potions (for obvious reasons), and you will be moving MUCH more slowly. However, when you're finally done, it's near invisible, and most players will give up trying to reach it. Naturally, it's much easier to have each player use /sethome in the base after using /tp to reach you than having everyone swim down and wasting precious resources doing so. You should also note that most servers will let you use /spawn in the nether, so you can leave. As an extra precaution, have an emergency potion of fire resistance for every member of the faction, in case of a leak. Be sure to have no wood or wool inside any part of your base (in 1.9 this becomes less of an issue due to splash water bottles). When you're done, proceed to the next step.

#### Nethertop Base
Penetrating the top bedrock of the Nether will give you a very large, flat plain of bedrock(with the occasional mushroom) to work with. Also, as the top of the nether can only be penetrated by the most skilled players, stealth is completely optional. Build a normal, overworld above-land stronghold on top of this bedrock and light up your area (mobs usually won't spawn on bedrock, but they'll start appearing once you start building something else). If possible, elevate the base 1 block from the bedrock surface so that anyone attempting to pop above the bedrock directly under your base will succeed (and suffocate), and use a Fire Resistance potion and lava to build TNT-proof walls. Exit can usually be achieved with a Nether portal or /spawn. One can also build a nether-sky base once they get up the bedrock.

Note: This is Java Edition only.

#### Step 2: Interior functionality and defense
You will need a different set of supplies in your base if you're in the nether, you will need extra brewing stands for the constant resupply of fire resistance potions, fewer chests devoted to fuels since buckets of lava and blaze rods are readily available. Furnaces are also needed less in general as few things in the nether need to be smelted. Weapons and armor will see much use, so have extra anvils ready. A map showing where the nether portal is located is also crucial should you need to return to the overworld. Crafting tables remain necessary, as will enchantment tables. Setting up a melon farm is likely your best source of food, as the plant's growth is unaffected by how fertile the soil is. Be sure to have cauldrons filled with water. For defense, you can usually get away with pitfall traps and arrows, though you will still need obsidian padding.

#### Getting ready for the rest of forever
At this point you've gone beyond what the wiki can help you with, if you're not sure what direction to continue in, here are some ideas:

- Stockpile diamonds and iron, as well as setting up an overworld outpost
- Improve defenses, as players here are almost guaranteed to be equipped and experienced.
- Set up a blaze grinder, as well as one for wither skeletons
- Hoard nether quartz and nether wart if at all possible
- Run fire drills with your faction, as these will be much needed
- Set up an armory, with at least 2 designated sets of gear for each faction member
- Stock up on fire protection potions, fire protection enchantments, and anything else that would prove useful against flames.
- Hoard everything you can get a hold of, you NEVER know what will assist you in the nether.
- Expand your melon farm, and perhaps set up a tree farm or mushroom farm
