## Using the diamonds
With diamonds, a player can craft some of the best items the game has to offer:

- Diamondpickaxe(allows mining obsidian for the enchanting table, and to make anetherportal. Highly recommended with the first diamonds the player collects) (renewable fromtoolsmithvillager)
- Enchanting table
- Diamondsword(renewable fromweaponsmithvillagers)
- Diamondaxe(renewable from toolsmith and weaponsmith villagers)
- Diamondshovel(renewable from toolsmith villagers)
- Diamondhelmet(renewable from armorer villagers)
- Diamondchestplate(renewable from armorer villagers)
- Diamondleggings(renewable from armorer villagers)
- Diamondboots(renewable from armorer villagers)
- Jukebox
- Diamondhoe(renewable from toolsmith villager)

In total to make one of every single diamond related item you need 38 diamonds.

### Diamond tools
Diamonds can be used to make shovels, pickaxes, axes, and hoes that work almost as fast as gold and last significantly longer than almost any other tool. Most players use their first three diamonds to make a diamond pickaxe, the only tool in the game that can harvest obsidian blocks, except for the extremely late-game netherite pickaxe. Although a diamond hoe lasts longer than any other hoe, with the exception of a netherite hoe, it grants no speed boost and is generally considered a waste of diamonds, as any hoe is sufficient to till farmland. Hoes are more useful in the 1.16 nether update, as they are the quickest tools for breaking leaves, hay bales, sponges, and many other blocks. They can also receive enchantments from the enchanting table, including Efficiency, Unbreaking, Silk Touch, and Fortune. So, the player might want to spend some diamonds on a diamond hoe or purchase one from a toolsmith.

### Diamond weapons and armor
Diamond swords deal the second most damage of any sword—seven points—although both iron and diamond swords kill most enemies with 3 hits, making iron swords preferable to unenchanted diamond swords as they are cheaper and just about as useful. Diamond armor protects the wearer better than any other armor aside from netherite. Diamond armor and swords both have the advantage of greater durability than armor and swords of any other material aside from netherite. A full set of diamond armor requires 24 diamonds, and 9 diamonds more to make a full set of tools, which contains a pickaxe, a sword, an axe and a shovel.

### Other diamond items
After making a diamond pickaxe, it is usual to mine some obsidian and use the next two diamonds for an enchanting table. This allows players to convert experience into valuable enchantments to improve weapons, armor, and tools.

Diamonds are also required to make jukeboxes, and can be used in decorative diamond blocks, though players would only want to make diamond blocks really late-game.

Also, diamond can be used to trade with villagers. One emerald can be obtained from one diamond, although this is a waste, unless a player has created a good trading farm and has lots of diamonds.

## Maintaining and expanding the supply
Once players have realized how useful their first diamonds are, they probably want more. To this end, they need to continue mining. If they want to become truly diamond-rich, though, they need to do a few other things first.

### Getting a Fortune III pickaxe
The player should mine with the Fortune enchantment on a pickaxe, preferably level III, for the next diamond blob, to significantly improve the number of diamonds they get. Also, this is not something they can rely on, but they can try. If they find a large diamond blob, they have an enchanting table, and are confident they can get a Fortune III, it might be worth waiting and acquiring the diamonds later or mining it with a Silk Touch pickaxe and harvesting the ore when they acquire Fortune III. If they see the hint on the table say Fortune III, immediately enchant a diamond pickaxe with it.

Enchanting is somewhat complex, but here is how to bootstrap the equipment needed: Start with at least 5 diamonds. Use the first three for a diamond pickaxe to mine obsidian. Four obsidian blocks plus the other two diamonds and one book are used to craft an enchanting table. In fact, one needs a lot of books, but one is necessary to craft the table.

#### Obtaining books and bookshelves
For the books, a player needs leather from cows, horses, or llamas, or even from fishing. Leather can also be obtained by bartering with piglins in the Nether. The first book requires just one piece of leather and three pieces of paper (from three pieces of sugar cane), which can be obtained from a cow farm and a sugar cane farm. A wheat farm is useful for breeding the cows. To reach the maximum amount of enchanting, players need 46 leather, one for the book to craft the table and the rest for the bookshelves.

If the player can manage to get a tool with Silk Touch, this can significantly reduce the difficulty of obtaining bookshelves. If they find a village, they often contain a house with a number of bookshelves. Bookshelves can also be found in stronghold libraries. If they have Silk Touch, they can simply steal the bookshelves whole. Even without Silk Touch, they can still get the books by mining the bookshelves but must provide wood to re-craft the bookshelves.

After crafting the enchanting table, small enchantments are possible, but to get Fortune, let alone Fortune III — the table's power must be boosted with bookshelves. 15 bookshelves are needed, requiring 45 books, in turn requiring 45 leather, 135 paper, and 90 planks, so having a tree farm is handy. See the Enchanting article for details of how to arrange those.
