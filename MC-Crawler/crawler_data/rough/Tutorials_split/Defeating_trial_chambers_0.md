## Finding trial chambers
Trial chambers only generate underground, making them more difficult to find. The simplest method of finding them is to buy a trial chambers explorer map from a journeyman-level cartographer villager. This costs 12 emeralds and 1 compass. If you do not have access to a village, you can either mine underground and hope to stumble upon trial chambers, travel through caves until you find trial chambers which are exposed to the air.



## Defeating the trial chambers
It can be advantageous to set up a base of operations. If you are near a chamber with multiple spawners, including the breeze, you can block up the entrance as soon as you activate the trial spawners and allowed the mobs to attack you and are outside of the entrance. That way, you can use your sword to hit the mobs when they are close enough to the blocked entrance.
