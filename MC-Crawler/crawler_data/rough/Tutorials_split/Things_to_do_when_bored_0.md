# Tutorials/Things to do when bored
While Minecraft is a huge game with endless possibilities, there will always be a time where a player may believe they've done everything, or built everything possible in the game. Here is a list of ideas for players who are bored and may be looking for something fun to do in the game, although most players will have already done many of these.

## Dig a quarry
A quarry is a big project, but the rewards are huge. You just dig a big hole down to bedrock and put a chest under it.
In Hardcore mode, a quarry is a very big push to help you survive. This might be hard to do because you have to make tools and gather wood.

## Play Hardcore mode
Most players have played normal Survival mode, but Hardcore is a much more difficult variant of it. When in Hardcore mode, the player is not only restricted to hard difficulty, meaning that mobs deal greater damage, the player can starve to death, and multiple other game features are much more challenging. Furthermore, if the player dies, they can only return to the world in Spectator mode, meaning they can never interact with that world again (unless cheats are used).

## Play Ultra Hardcore mode
Similar to Hardcore mode, this game mode only gives the player one life. However, this game mode also removes the ability to naturally regenerate health, meaning that golden apples and potions and even beacons have to be used to regenerate health. This is a game mode even harder than regular Hardcore, and is not recommended for new players.

## Change the rules
Try changing some rules! Here are some examples:Level system: Rookie (Beginner Level): You can't use tools or craft an item. New player (Levels 1-4): You can use only wooden and gold tools, only wood, planks, cobblestone, and dirt. You can't wear armor at the same time. Introduction (Levels 5-8): You can only use wooden and gold tools. Only wood, planks, cobblestone, flower, dirt, coal, and gold can be used. Citizen (Levels 9-12): You can use stone tools or redstone.Knight (Levels 12-15): You can do anything a citizen can do, and use iron tools, and wear iron armor and gold armor. Technician (Levels 16-19): You can do anything a knight can do, and you can create with diamonds and use diamond tools and armor. Mage (Level 20+): You can do what any technician can and create with anything.

## Nomadic mode
1. You cannot build a home. In this case, a "house" is defined as having four walls and a door.
2. Not only that, but you cannot feed animals.
3. You cannot cook food, but you can smelt ore.
4. Likewise, you cannot build or use a bed. For a better game experience, seeTutorials/Nomadic experience.

## Build an army
If you're in a server and there's a lot of people there, why not start a war? Build up your own army, feed your warriors, give them arms and armor, and rush to destroy enemies bases, while defending your own.



## Build a statue
Build a giant statue of anything, whether it is in-game or real life, using Minecraft blocks. Examples include an ender dragon, a real-life piano, or the player's in-game skin. If playing in multiplayer, it is recommended to not build with something flammable, to prevent your structure from being torched by griefers.

## Pixel art
Main article: Tutorials/Pixel art
Similar to statues, pixel art uses dyed wool or other textures to create spectacular 2D mosaics! Find a low resolution image and assign a material to each pixel. The image can then be recreated in Minecraft.

## Build a roller coaster
Rails and minecarts can be combined with blocks to create roller coasters. These can have drops, sharp turns, and scenery. Although they are usually built in the Overworld, they can also be built in the Nether, or a portal could even be used to make a roller coaster that travels through both dimensions interchangeably. There are infinite possibilities. See Tutorials/Building a rollercoaster for more info.

## Nether village
It's easy in superflat creative mode. It's time-consuming but it's also fun. You can make a village look like the Nether! If you want to build a village that looks like it's in The Nether, you need nether brick, nether brick stairs and fences, glowstone, netherrack, soul sand, a bucket of lava, crimson or warped hyphae, and nether warts.

Step 1: Manufacturing farm: use soul sand to replace farmland, lava to replace water, nether warts to replace crops such as wheat, and nether bricks to replace wood.

Step 2: Build nether buildings: nether bricks or nether crimson hyphae/warped hyphae to replace overworld wood, nether brick stairs to replace ordinary stairs, use nether brick fences instead of glass, the soul sand to replace wood and cobblestone, the ground of indoor use nether bricks. You can also use crimson doors instead of regular wooden doors. 

Step 3: Streetlights: Destroy all street lights in the village and replace them with nether brick fences and glowstone.

Step 4: Lava wells: As above. Use soul sand to replace cobblestone, lava to replace water.

Step 5: L-shaped house: The structure is the same, but the roof should be replaced by nether bricks and nether brick stairs.

Step 6: Blacksmith: The structure is also the same, but chests should fill with nether bricks and items that nether mobs drop.

Step 7: Build a large netherrack cube wrapped around the village and add lava, fire, and add caves, to make it look really like in the Nether!
