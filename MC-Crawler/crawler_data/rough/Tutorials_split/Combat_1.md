#### Husks

See also: Husk

Spawning exclusively in deserts, husks have the same behavior as zombies but don't burn under sunlight and inflict the player the Hunger effect. While marginally more dangerous than normal zombies, husks still don't pose much of a threat and can usually be dealt with like any other zombie.

Due to husks only spawning in deserts, you can avoid them entirely by not going into a desert biome.

#### Skeletons

See also: Skeleton

Skeletons are difficult to slay in melee combat unless you have the correct tactics. However, if you have weak armor, just sprinting toward one and timing your hits correctly can work, but you will take a few shots in the process. Like zombies, they burn in sunlight; if you are low on health and arrows, wait until day breaks so that the sunlight deals with all skeletons.

Skeletons have 20 × 10 points of health and they deal 1 – 5 damage, depending on difficulty and proximity‌[Bedrock Edition  only].

Additionally, skeletons are more accurate the higher the difficulty is. On Hard, dodging their hits is quite challenging, and running away almost always results in a hit, as does trying to wait around the corner and attack the edge of the skeleton. By blocking with a shield, you negate damage taken, and the arrow bounces off the shield.

One of the best ways to approach a skeleton is by circling around them and while doing so, approach and hit/block them. You can also jump-sprint so that there is a chance that the skeleton shoots over or under them. It is then possible for you to hit, block, and repeat until you kill them.

As with all undead mobs, using weapons enchanted with Smite can be very useful against skeletons. Stone axe (or better) with Smite V kills unarmored skeletons in one hit, without the need of criticals or Strength effect. Such axe kills in one hit even skeletons with full iron armor (unenchanted) if a critical hit is performed.

Using sprint hits on skeletons might backfire, as knocking them back gives them a free shot at you before they can approach.

One can make short work of a skeleton by shooting it while outside its search range. If detected, charge the bow shortly after dodging a skeleton's arrow to prevent being shot while under the slowing effects of a charging bow.

Another easy way to subdue skeletons is by pushing them into the water since they sink. When underwater in Bedrock Edition, skeletons stop using ranged attacks and switch to melee attacks, which makes them much less threatening.

Wolves naturally hunt skeletons. Thanks to that, biomes with wolves are a bit safer. Also, since you usually encounter skeletons with other mobs (including other skeleton), you can try getting the skeleton to shoot another mob so that it can aid you in killing the skeleton.

#### Strays

See also: Stray

Strays behave near identically to skeletons, but are more dangerous than their normal counterpart. Strays shoot arrows of Slowness which slow players down and prevents sprinting. Strays use a melee attack that also inflicts Slowness underwater, so fighting them with a ranged weapon is recommended as the stray can be hard to reach and kill, especially when armored and equipped with an enchanted bow. 

Strays only spawn in snowy biomes, so living in a non-snowy biome avoids encounters with this mob.

Wolves naturally hunt strays, so a snowy taiga biome is a safer place to live or explore on.

#### Bogged

Bogged also behave near identically to skeletons, but are even more dangerous than strays. Bogged shoot arrows of Poison, which deal 3 to 5 damage, in addition to inflicitng the Poison effect, which lasts for 4 seconds. However, they have only 16 × 8 points of health and can be killed slightly easier than normal skeletons. Stone axe (or better) with Smite III kills bogged in one hit, without the need of criticals or Strength effect. The same effect can be achieved with any sword enchanted with Smite V.

Poison effect can be cured by drinking milk or honey bottles. Note that Poison on its own can't kill you.

#### Creepers

See also: Creeper

Creepers are very powerful and often catch players of all experience levels off guard, despite their small line of sight. On Hard difficulty, the player can't even survive a point-blank creeper explosion with unenchanted netherite armor. Creepers don’t usually get that close though, and begin to explode up to 3 blocks away because of their detection radius. Using an axe for combat is recommended, as they deal more damage per hit, and the player is highly advised against trying to hit one multiple times consecutively anyways.‌[Java Edition  only]

Creepers have 20 × 10 points of health. One way to kill them is to hit with a sprint attack and immediately walk backward after, having the Knockback enchantment can help with this greatly. Alternatively, you can find sufficiently high ground to strike a creeper from above with a melee weapon without the detonation sequence being activated. By making a 3–4 block pillar by pillar-jumping, and waiting until the creeper comes next to the pillar, you can attack it without exploding.

If you have an iron or diamond sword, charge and spam-click‌[Bedrock Edition  only]. You need to be extremely fast as they explode relatively quickly. 

In Java Edition, killing creepers in one melee hit is possible only with Strength effect and critical hits. Some ways to achieve the one-hit kill include:

- Strength I + netherite axe + Sharpness I + critical hit;
- Strength I + stone axe + Sharpness III + critical hit;
- Strength II + stone axe + critical hit;
- Strength II + netherite sword + critical hit;
- Strength II + iron sword + Sharpness V + critical hit.

Another risky way to kill a creeper is to charge it and perform two consecutive critical hits with a diamond or netherite sword. If this is done correctly, the creeper is killed before it has time to finish its explosion countdown. However, this requires quick reflexes and a bit of practice, so players should train themselves in a Creative test world before they try this in Survival.

Creeper explosions can be completely blocked by shields—useful for surviving ambushes in cramped spaces, such as caves.

The safest way to engage a creeper is from a distance by shooting arrows at it with a bow so it cannot explode near the player. Unenchanted bow kills creepers in three shots, while a bow with Power V might kill them in one shot. The player can finish off the creeper with a melee weapon after shooting the creeper to save arrows.

Swimming creepers can be easily dealt with using melee attacks while the player is on land.

Creepers also run away if close to a cat or ocelot; having a pet cat keeps creepers at a distance.

During thunderstorms, if lightning strikes close enough to a creeper, it becomes charged. Charged creepers are one of the most dangerous mobs in the game, with it's close range explosion dealing so much damage that a player with full diamond armor enchanted with Blast Protection IV is left on just 2 hearts. However, the lightning also damages the creeper, making it a faster kill if you decide to attack it. Just make sure it doesn't explode and you should be able to kill it just like normal creepers.

If you don't plan to harvest the gunpowder or experience from a creeper, one way to deal with one is to just let it blow up. The safest way to blow up a creeper is with a flint and steel. Just simply use the flint and steel on the creeper, and run away before it explodes. Although the creeper drops nothing this way, it's still effectively dead, and can no longer harm the player. If the creeper is next to multiple other monsters, you can kill all of them by simply lighting the creeper up. Note that if you use this strategy, you might have to patch up lots of explosion holes if you don't like them.

If you don't have a shield, another way to block off a creeper's explosion is to place a block in front of the exploding creeper at its feet level. It can be any solid block, even one with low blast resistance like dirt or sand. Since explosion damage is calculated from the feet of the creeper, by placing this block, the "exposure" of the player to the explosion is substantially reduced, and you would typically only take 1 damage. The terrain around would still be damaged though, so you should make sure not to stand in dangerous places while doing this (like floating batch of sand or a lava lake).
