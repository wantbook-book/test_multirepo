### Sofa and chairs
More Chair Designs. From top left clockwise: Sitting chairs (4 of them), low chair, bar chair, piano chair, "sofa" made from warped items and two cyan beds, and a orange sofa set.
A sofa can be made using 2-4 stair blocks, with a sign attached to either side as "arms". Also, as of Java Edition 1.4.2, one could use stairs facing inward to create "arms". An alternate type of sofa can be made by placing 2 or more slabs in a row and surround the sides and back with blank signs. To make a 'leather' sofa, use slabs surrounded by wool blocks.

Another way to make a nice couch is to place four wood planks in a row, with wood slabs on top. Then, put two wood planks on the ends and two rails in the middle. Place minecarts on the rails, and there! You have a couch you can actually sit on!

Chairs can be made similarly to sofas, but the 'sitting' area is only 1 block wide. There are many variations of the chair listed below.
You could just place 1 stair block for a simple chair.
You could also put 1 stair block down, and put blank signs on the side for an armchair.
You could also put down 1 slab, with blank signs on the sides and the back for a cool-looking armchair.

If you have a tamed wolf, you may also want a dog bed in your house for it to sit on. You can make one using 2 wood slabs in a row, with signs attached on the sides, front and back. Also, since the 1.6.1 update, place 2 carpet color of choice on the ground.

A throne can be made by placing a minecart track on the ground with a block (stone, cobblestone, or iron blocks are best) on one end and a staircase on the other end. placing another block on top of the first and one on either side of it. Then, four stairs are placed to the sides of the minecart track and the original staircase. Then, place two stairs on the two side blocks. Put a minecart on the track and enjoy the throne you can sit on.

A step up into the modern world of interior design is the "lounge bench". Make an extra-long "sofa" with a 90-degree angle in it somewhere, no sign "arms", and possibly using slabs and blocks, instead of stair pieces. If in a corner, a bookshelf looks appealing in the corner, and blends in with the wood's texture. You can also place any type of stairs (oak wood stairs are recommended) and place blocks on the sides.

Another model looks like a sofa from a TV show. You are required to have 3 height, 2 length and 6 width. You can use spruce wood or brown wool to make it look like that TV show sofa, but you have to have 26 blocks of that material. Any material is okay, but otherwise, it will not look like the prototype. First, lay 12 blocks of your material in a 2×6 rectangle. Then add your material to ½ of your sofa (width). Then, on the ends of where there is 1 layer of material, add 1 block to each end. Now just add 6 blocks on top of the 2 block height area (other than the ends and add 1 block on each. Never set near fires, as the sofa will burn up.

You can also make a working chair, using a minecart, rail, stair, 2 signs, any full block, a piston, and a lever. First place a piston 2 blocks above where you want your chair to be (facing down) and place a lever on the side of it, next place a full block with a rail on it where you want your chair to be, then place a minecart on the rail and break the block below the rail, after that place a stair where the rail was, finally activate the lever, it should push the stair block into the minecart, now break the piston and lever and place signs on the sides of the chair. To make a cool desk chair you could use a  Red Nether Brick Slab instead of a stair, spruce or dark oak trapdoors instead of signs and 2 more trapdoors behind the chair as the back, and a red banner on the top back trapdoor hanging into the seat (you could also make a working a couch using this method). IMPORTANT: if you touch the chair while moving, it could mess up the minecart. there are 2 ways to fix this, the first is taking apart the chair and repeating these steps, the second can also also prevent this but requires cheats, for the second one you can either enter the command: /tp @e [type=minecart,c=1] (replace this with the coordinates of the chair) facing (replace this with the coordinates 1 block to the left or right of the chair), or place a repeating command block under the chair set to 600 ticks in delay and always active with the same command as before. Ex. if your chair is at coordinates 176 85 293 and facing north then the command is: /tp @e [type=minecart,c=1] 176 85 293 facing 176 85 294(Note: the last number could be 294 or 292).

### Fireplace
Fireplaces give your living room a more "homey" feel. A fireplace can literally be a little hole in the wall with netherrack in it. Or it can be a sleek, ultra-modern piece of contemporary Minecraft art. 

For the actual fire, the simplest option is to simply use a campfire. This has the right appearance and has the useful function of cooking food without fuel, while also not igniting nearby blocks. Campfires can still damage mobs that touch them, so make sure that nothing can get to them. The alternatives are burning netherrack, lava or even an operating furnace.

A nice design is a brick outline in the wall and floor (slabs can make the area around it on the floor elevated). Then make a 1×2×1 hole in the wall inside the brick outline and put in a campfire/netherrack. Light the netherrack (if going with this option), and add a chimney for all the smoke to go out through (and it's also an outside decoration!) A more contemporary and "sleek" design is to make the same brick outline but with lava inside, and put glass in front of the lava, making for an ultra-modern, "artificial fireplace" feel. Iron bars can be added around the fire to look like a fire guard for a more realistic look.

For an alternate fireplace design, pick a spot away from any flammable material. Next, dig a 1 block deep hole (2 blocks if using netherrack) and put the fire in it. Next, you should place a glass block on top of the fire so you won't burn yourself (you will have to put a block adjacent to the hole to place the glass block then later remove it). Put chairs and/or couches surrounding this and you have yourself a fire pit and lounge.

An example of a traditional fireplace. The wooden blocks seen behind are flammable, and are in reach as well as some of the ceiling blocks. These are well in the fire range so be careful where the wood is located.
To build an old-style brick built fireplace, you will want this next to a wall. First, dig a 3 block deep hole. After that, add netherrack at the bottom and light it up. Third, place netherrack on the top of the hole. Next, place a brick on both sides of the fire and put another brick on top of those and in the middle of the ones in the top. Repeat in front of the bricks so you cannot throw things in the fire. This part is optional. If you want to add a chimney, add bricks on the top to the sides and the front of the fire. Keep adding until you reach your roof and then break the area where the fire is. Add 2-3 more levels of the chimney on the roof. Finally, add netherrack on your roof level and light it up!

Alternatively, you can build a traditional style fireplace, which is similar to the old-style fireplace but more elaborate. Simply make a 5×2 floorspace from cobblestone, and replace the center-back block with netherrack (or put a campfire on top of this block). Next, place a 3-high column of stone bricks on each side of the netherrack/campfire, and place stone brick stairs on each side (place them so that the steps go toward the center). Add a stone brick between the two stairs, and attach an additional stone brick below. Build up a column of stone bricks upward from the center brick, until it exits the house, placing a torch on top to imitate a chimney stoke. Finally, ignite the netherrack and add nether-brick fences around the opening. You could also add stone stairs to the underside of the opening. See the image for reference.

IMPORTANT: If you're not using a campfire, wood blocks and stairs will ignite if they are less than 4 blocks above the fire or any adjacent blocks. You can turn off fire spreading with the command: /gamerule doFireTick false, but if fire is ignited (by player, lighting etc.) on a flammable object, it will burn forever unless you stop it. However, the rest of your house will be fine.

Make a huge fireplace 3×3 with a campfire/netherrack, and then add a fence at the side (it'll need to be a nether brick fence if you're using netherrack) and progress it to the center. It should be 3 blocks from the ground. Now, descend it to almost the fire level (2 blocks away) and add a cauldron to the nether brick fence. Add water in and it's done! Fun if making witch houses.

Automatic fireplaces activate at the push of a button or the pull of a lever. There is a glitch that lets fire charges go through a 1-meter wide wall when shot out of a dispenser. Make a wall out of non-flammable material. Leave a 3 space gap. Then make another wall. In the gap, put a single block located right beside where you want the dispenser. Place a dispenser so it is facing the inside wall and there is no space between the dispenser and the wall. Place redstone on the block that leads to the dispenser [you have to use a repeater]. Start building the inside. You need to surround a piece of netherrack with iron bars. Make sure the floor is not made out of any wooden materials, wool or carpets as they will burn. You may decorate this any other way but place a button where the redstone signal would receive the input. Then, place multiple fire charges in the dispenser [they don't have any other important use]. You will have to kill blazes and creepers/ghasts and mine coal or kill wither skeletons to make them so they are hard to make but are worth the trouble.

For a more effective fireplace, place a sticky piston that is activated by a NOT gate. Replace the button with the lever. You may need to use repeaters to delay the dispenser. When you switch the fireplace off, a piston pops out and burns out the fire. You may want to make a fake chimney to hide the piston.

For a unique look to your fireplace, use a dispenser to dispense burning arrows to make the fire look better. You will need some redstone skills to make this.
