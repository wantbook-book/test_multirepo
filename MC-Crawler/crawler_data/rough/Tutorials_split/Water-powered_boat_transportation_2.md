### How it works
After the final dirt block is removed, the two-block-wide space in front of the step has a void space (occupied by a button) and a still-water block (where the dirt used to be). Another void space is upstream ("downhill" direction) one block diagonally from the void space at the step. Otherwise the channel is completely filled with flowing water. Because the boat is bigger than one block, it does not get stuck in either void space. The current pushes the boat diagonally into the still-water block at the bottom of the step, at which point the boat floats up into the flowing water above, and the boat continues on its way.

The boat is always floating downstream, but at each step, it runs into submerged still-water block that buoys the boat up into the next flow. In this way the boat can climb uphill.

The boat submerges while navigating the step, but mobs in the boat do not drown. The top half of a villager's head is always exposed when the boat is submerged.

### Practical construction
Here is a simple procedure for constructing a water-powered uphill boat channel, using a step depth of 3 blocks for each 1 block increase in elevation. The example illustrates a channel that raises the boat in height by four steps, using only water power.

- 1. Create the channel steps and make walls around the channel.2. Place dirt blocks at the bottom of each step on alternating sides.
- 3. Place a button behind ("downhill") and diagonally up from each dirt block and from each step. Add more wall blocks to accommodate the buttons.4. Place a water block on the wall block diagonally up ("downhill") from each dirt block. Each wall block that gets a water block is indicated by a torch.
- 5. Remove the dirt blocks and place a boat at the bottom. Watch it float upward to the top!
- This is a steeper hill, with a step depth of 2 blocks for each 1 block increase in elevation. It is constructed exactly the same way.
