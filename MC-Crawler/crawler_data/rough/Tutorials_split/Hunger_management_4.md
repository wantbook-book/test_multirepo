## Emergency measures
If your hunger meter is dropping and you have no food in hand, there are a few emergency measures you can take, depending on available resources.

** Milk **
If you have a bucket and a cow, mooshroom or goat milk them. The milk will let you fill up onrotten flesh,raw chicken,spider eyes, orpoisonous potatoes, and then cure the illness.
** Fast crops **
If you have anypotatoesorcarrots, and somebone meal(craft 3 from oneskeletonbone, or get fromcomposter), you can make a hoe and till somedirtnear anywatersource, then plant your vegetables and use the bone meal to make them mature more quickly. It can take several pieces of bone meal to get a mature plant. Cooking the potatoes will make them much more filling. If you have the bone meal but no carrots or potatoes, you can destroy someshort grassnear a river or lake, make and use ahoe, then plantwheat seedsand use the bone meal to rapidly grow yourwheat. The same caveats as above apply to the use of bone meal.
** Doing nothing **
You won't lose hunger if you don't do anything (walking, mining, healing, etc.). InHardcoreespecially, this can be a necessary strategy while waiting for crops or baby animals to grow.
** Death **
A last-ditch measure: If you're close to yourbedor spawn point, stuff yourinventoryandarmorinto achestor two â€¦ thendie. OnHard mode, you can just wait to die of starvation, otherwise, good methods are drowning, jumping off cliffs, or droppinggravelorsandon yourself. You will respawn with full health and hunger bars, and can then reclaim your stuff. Naturally, this method doesn't apply in hardcore. Note that this isn't a totally free solution: you lose most of yourexperience.
