#### Creeper
Creepers are ugly in their colors, so use plenty of different colors when making a creeper with pixel art. Use lime wool/concrete, green wool/concrete, white wool/concrete, and light gray wool/concrete for different parts of the creeper. If you want even more variations for colors similar to these, use the same colors but in terracotta for some parts of the creeper, so that you can have a slight contrast. Also, you may want to use blocks that are not wool, concrete, or terracotta, such as stone or slime blocks. The most important thing when making a creeper is to line the blocks up perfectly with the pixels on the creeper's face, as this is the most noticeable part.

Here is a simple example for starters:

#### Witch
Witches are slightly easier to make than the mobs mentioned previously, as witches do not have quite as many colors in them. Their "feet" should be made of light gray wool/concrete and yellow terracotta, and their "legs" should be made of green, lime, and purple wool/concrete. Their torso should be made of mostly purple wool/concrete, with blue terracotta to highlight the center of it. Their face should be made with white terracotta, with light gray terracotta for highlights. Their eyes should be made with purple terracotta and white wool/concrete, their eyebrows black wool/concrete, and the area below their nose with orange terracotta. Finally, their hat should be made of black wool/concrete, gray wool/concrete, green terracotta, lime wool/concrete, and green wool/concrete.

See the following grid for an example of how to make a witch's face:

#### Iron golem
The basic layout of the iron golem is white with "rusted" parts that are more brown. For the white or light gray parts of the iron golem, use white wool/concrete and light gray wool/concrete. For the slightly "rusted" parts, use white terracotta, light gray terracotta, and gray terracotta. White and gray terracotta are actually slightly browned, making them perfect for this circumstance. Use red and black wool/concrete for the iron golem's eyes.

Iron golems have vine-like streaks of green running down their left side. These can be made with yellow, lime, and green wool/concrete. If you want, you can even mix in a little bit of lime terracotta or green terracotta, for some variation, or simply replace the lime and green wool/concrete with terracotta.

## Designs in real life
Designs in real life refer to taking objects that can be found in the world, and building them in Minecraft using blocks. You can also build objects that don't exist in real life but do in movies.

### Overview
When building something from real life, first you must decide what you're going to build. It's recommended to build something easy, such as a box, before trying to build much more difficult things, such as a car. If you're in survival mode, make sure you have all of the necessary materials before starting to build. When in survival, it's strongly recommended to use primarily renewable materials for larger pixel art. 

Once you know what you're going to build and you have the materials, you need to make sure that what you are going to build in Minecraft is proportionate to what real life object you're basing it on. The easiest way to do this is by setting a legend for what a block equals. For example, you may decide to have 1 block equal 1 cubic centimeter (100:1 scale). For bigger objects (such as buildings) 1 block may equal 1 cubic meter (actual size), or perhaps for giant objects (such as the earth) a cubic kilometer. It all depends on the size of the object, and how detailed you want it to be.

Something that is fun to do once you have completed your pixel art project, is to make a hole to go inside of it. If you want, you can even turn the inside into a parkour course, a maze, a house, or a mine. If you're advanced with redstone, you may want to add some to the inside of the pixel art. There are many possibilities; it's up to you to decide which one to use.

### Shapes
When building advanced pixel art from real life that contains anything other than squares and rectangles, you must know how to build shapes that may be difficult to make in Minecraft. These include circles, triangles, spheres, and more. If new to building shapes, start off by breaking 3-dimensional shapes down into 2-dimensional, and combining the 2-dimensional back together. To learn more about how to build shapes, see Tutorials/Creating shapes.
