## A Furious Cocktail
Have every potion effect applied at the same time

Requirements: Have every status effect that can be obtained from a potion at the same time.

Get 13 potion effects at once. These can be obtained from brewing 12 potions:

| Effect                  | Recipe |
|-------------------------|--------|
| Fire Resistance         |        |
| Invisibility            |        |
| Jump Boost              |        |
| Night Vision            |        |
| Poison                  |        |
| Regeneration            |        |
| Slow Falling            |        |
| Slowness and Resistance |        |
| Speed                   |        |
| Strength                |        |
| Water Breathing         |        |
| Weakness                |        |

Optionally, you can extend these potions using redstone and/or turn them into splash potions using gunpowder. Then, drink/splash yourself with all potions in shortest time possible. As the Turtle Master potion has the shortest duration, you should use it last.

However, despite the name, the advancement does not track if you actually drink potions; it tracks the effects that you have. Source of these effects is irrelevant. You can, for example, use beacons for 5 out of 13 effects (Strength, Speed, Jump Boost, Resistance and Regeneration). You can also use suspicious stew, tipped arrows, golden apples etc., but note that effects from these have shorter duration and it might be tricky to apply all of them to yourself at once.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 100 experience.

Parent of: How Did We Get Here?

## Beaconator
Bring a beacon to full power

Requirements: Be in a 20×20×14 range when a beacon is activated with a pyramid of height 4 (excluding the beacon itself).

Be near a beacon when it is powered by a full-size level 4 pyramid. To acquire this, place blocks of iron, gold, diamond, emerald and/or netherite on the ground in a 9×9 square. Place another layer of mineral blocks on top of that in a 7×7 square, and another on top of that in a 5×5 square. Finally, your top layer should be 3×3, and you can place a beacon on top of this. A total of 164 mineral blocks are needed.

Once the beacon shoots its beam to the sky, you will get the advancement. Note that beacons require an unobstructed view of the sky (transparent blocks like glass are allowed, as well as bedrock in the nether ceiling).

A level 4 beacon can also give special and rare powers to the player, if opened and given a type of mineral. For more info, check out the "Beacon" page.

## 
Have every effect applied at the same time

Requirements: Have every non-instantaneous status effect applied to the player that is obtainable in Survival mode at the same time (with the exception of Saturation).

By most criteria, this is the hardest advancement in all of Minecraft. To get it, you need to be affected by all the following status effects at once:

Before attempting this advancement, you must have killed the ender dragon, so that you can reach the outer islands of the End. You also must have killed the wither, so that you have access to at least one beacon. Method described below is not the only valid one to complete How Did We Get Here, but it was designed to be as easy and safe as possible.

First, find a naturally-generated sculk shrieker (such that its can_summon property is true according to the targeted block info on the debug screen) as close as possible to an unexplored ocean monument (such that it still has at least one elder guardian). If you know your seed or are on a singleplayer world, you can use a seed map program like Chunkbase to look for a deep dark biome with a nearby ocean monument (note that, due to how the deep dark generates, it's impossible for a deep dark biome to be right under a deep ocean biome).

Dig a simple 2×2 staircase down to near the inner horizontal edge of the deep dark biome to about Y=-51 and tunnel around inside the deep dark biome to look for a cave system with a shrieker in it. Use the F3 debug screen to confirm that the shrieker's can_summon property is true, then surround the shrieker with wool (optional) and start destroying any nearby sculk sensors, followed by any sculk catalysts. If there are any other shriekers nearby besides the one you intend to use, destroy those first. If shriekers are activated three times (such that one of the "Warden draws close" sounds plays), carefully leave the area and wait at least thirty minutes for your warning level to drop back down to 0 before continuing, as a fourth shrieker activation within ten minutes after the "Warden draws close" sound will summon a warden. When done, double check that there are no more sensors nearby by making some extra noise around the area, then remove the wool surrounding the shrieker, but put a bottom slab on top of it to prevent you from accidentally stepping on it.

Then, begin building the contraption around the shrieker as shown below. (Note that you can't move or replace the shrieker, as it will remove its can_summon property). The stone bricks can be any full, solid block that blocks mob sightlines (including glass blocks), and the gold block can be any solid opaque block that can be powered by redstone. Note that all dispensers and observers are horizontal and the piston is facing up. The trapdoor in layer 2 should be covering the adjacent dispenser face, and the trapdoor in layer 1 should be covering the block under it so that the shulker minecart is raised slightly off the ground. When done, remove the bottom slab over the shrieker. The water column above the beacons should extend all the way up to sea level, and there should be no opaque blocks between the beacons and the sky (transparent blocks like water and leaves are fine). The iron blocks can be any beacon-compatible mineral block, but iron is the easiest and fastest to obtain because it can be farmed with iron golems.

Once finished, place the spectral arrows in the layer 1 dispenser and the splash potions in the layer 2 dispenser and set the beacons to Strength I+Regeneration I, Haste II, Speed II, Jump Boost II, and Resistance II. Dig a simple tunnel at least 1 block wide and at least 2 blocks tall from the top of the water column (at sea level) to the ocean and fill it with at least 1 layer of water (keeping at least 1 layer of air). Find a dolphin (remember that they can spawn in all ocean biome types except frozen and cold) and lead it back to the tunnel and down to the room with the waterlogged chests, then tie it to the fence post there and put a name tag on it to prevent it from despawning. The waterlogged chests should prevent the dolphin from drowning while also allowing it to keep contact with water to prevent it from dehydrating.

From the rails on layer 5, dig a straight staircase up and toward the world spawn until you reach the surface. At that point, go directly to the world spawn and use a compass to find the specific location of the world spawn, which is (by default) the northwest corner of a chunk. Press F3+G (or equivalent on a non-QWERTY keyboard) to show chunk borders and use a compass to find the 1×1 vertical column that the compass always points to as you walk around it. Make sure that there are no blocks over this block (including non-solid ones like flowers, grass, torches, and leaves), then surround the spot with glass and rails as shown below:

Layer 0








































Layer 1


































Layer 2























The netherrack shown above represents the world spawn, where entities show up when they come through the exit portal in the End.

Extend the rail out by 16 blocks on both ends, then begin running rails from this spot all the way to the staircase dug earlier, bridging over water if necessary. If possible, try to tunnel through hills rather than going over them, as the minecart could get stuck otherwise. It may take thousands of rails and bridging blocks to get from the world spawn to the build site, so it may be easier to simply bring a few stacks of logs and iron blocks with a crafting table to craft rails as you go. This is one of the most time-consuming parts of this advancement, but it's far more reliable than using a boat since boats can't be moved vertically up without a piston, riding a boat across water risks drowning the shulker if you move too quickly, and moving a boat across a bridge in the end risks having an enderman teleport and push the boat off the bridge and into the void. Using a minecart to carry the shulker, pushed by a furnace minecart, also allows the player to keep a healthy distance to avoid getting shot at by the shulker, and using a furnace minecart and regular rails instead of powered rails is much more resource-efficient.

Once the rails are run all the way from the world spawn to the build site, double check that there are no gaps anywhere in the rail line from the world spawn all the way up to the contraption's drop shaft. Then break the most recently used bed, make sure you're not wearing any armor with Thorns, optionally grab a shield, and head into the end to find an end city with two shulkers still at the entrance. The city should be as close to an end gateway as possible, though exact distance is less important than how much bridging you'll need to do between the two. Again, Chunkbase can be used to find a suitable candidate. Enter through the opposite side from the entrance to prevent the shulkers from seeing you and place blocks as shown below to obscure the shulkers' vision and set up the rails which will eventually be used to pick up the shulker.

The red concrete blocks mark the spaces that must contain full, solid blocks to prevent the shulker from being ejected there instead of inside the exit portal.
Once that's done, place regular rails leading all the way up and into the end gateway. Take note of the direction your rails are facing using the F3 debug screen, then go through the gateway. A trapdoor or fence gate can be used to force you into the 1-block-tall swimming position to go through without using an ender pearl each time. Depending on the type of gateway, you'll either end up at a corresponding gateway on the main island or on the obsidian platform at 100,49,0. If you arrive at the obsidian platform, just remember that any blocks on and above it will be reset to air anytime an entity enters the end, so if you exit and re-enter the end after building here (or if anyone else enters the end if you're on a server) before you get the shulker, you'll need to replace the rails. Wherever you arrive, place rails under yourself in the same direction as before and continue placing rails up to the corner of the exit portal, with an activator rail at the end, powered by a lever. The activator rail will try to eject the shulker into one of the up-to-8 adjacent air blocks at its Y level, so make sure that there are solid blocks in the spaces around the activator rail so that the only available spot is inside the exit portal.


Now head back to the end city, double-check to make sure you don't have Thorns on your armor, enter through the back like before, place a minecart on the powered rails, and crouch and use a fishing rod to hook the minecart, then get behind the glass blocks and pull the minecart. Wait for the shulker to pass by, then place a furnace minecart on the powered rails and give it some coal/charcoal and a push toward the shulker minecart. Keeping a safe distance, follow the two through the gateway, onto the main island, and up to the exit portal. You should see an empty minecart and furnace minecart and no shulker nearby. Grab both minecarts and go through the exit portal and you should see the shulker in the glass enclosure from earlier. Place the minecart and furnace minecart on the rails leading to the shulker, give the furnace minecart some coal/charcoal and a push, and the shulker will be picked up. Follow it at a safe distance all the way to the build site, but be careful to not let the shulker take damage on the way. If you suspect the shulker may not be at full health, hit it with a splash potion of regeneration. The shulker minecart should fall into the column on top of the trapdoor. Once it does, place a top slab just over the shulker to lock it in place.

Now head to the ocean monument and time how long it takes to go from the ocean monument back to the build site. If it takes longer than about two and a half minutes, you'll need to use nether portals to get from place to place. It may be helpful to build the portals on top of the nether roof to facilitate easy, safe transit. Now look for the nearest pillager outpost and village (Chunkbase can be used for this as well) and build portals to get there as well (unless you can get from the village to the pillager outpost and from the pillager outpost to the build site in under 10 minutes each). At the village, trap at least one villager in a fully-enclosed area with access to a job site, as this is all that's required to count as a "village" for the purpose of raids. At the pillager outpost, it may be helpful to fill the spawning area of the outpost (a 72×54×72 cuboid centered on the top floor) with as many grass spawning platforms as possible to maximize the chances for pillagers (and therefore pillager captains) to spawn and decrease the time it'll take after beating a raid to get Bad Omen again.

At this point, double check that the contraption is set up correctly with a nametagged dolphin tied to the fencepost, a shulker in a minecart next to the shrieker, spectral arrows in the lower dispenser, and splash potions of Fire Resistance, Invisibility, Night Vision, Slowness, Slow Falling, Water Breathing, and Weakness in the upper dispenser (behind the vertical trapdoor). Make sure you can get from the village to the pillager outpost in under 10 minutes, from the pillager outpost to the ocean monument in under 10 minutes, and from the ocean monument to the contraption in under 2.5 minutes (if not, you may need some extra swiftness potions or some other means of fast transportation through the nether portals). Also make sure that the bottom slab covering the sculk shrieker has been removed. If everything looks good, you should be ready to start the process of getting all the effects. It's recommended to make a backup of the world before continuing in case something goes wrong. It may also be helpful to record your screen so that, if something goes wrong, you can see exactly which effect(s) weren't applied.

The sequence for getting the effects is as follows:  

1. Go to the pillager outpost and kill a pillager captain to getBad Omen(1/27).
2. Optional: wait for another pillager captain to spawn. Name tag him and trap somewhere for killing it later—better to do it now than after the raid, because Bad Omen lasts much longer than Hero of the Village.
3. Go to the village (losingBad Omen(0/27)) and beat a raid (kill at least one raid mob in a raid that ends in victory) to getHero of the Village(1/27). Timer is now 40 minutes. After this point, you should make sure to only eat food if absolutely necessary. Your hunger bar must beat most15/20 by the time you reach the contraption.
4. Go back to the pillager outpost and kill the previously prepared pillager captain to getBad Omenagain (2/27). Be careful to not enter another village after that.
5. Go to the ocean monument and get cursed by an elder guardian to getMining Fatigue(3/27). Timer is now at most 5 minutes.
6. Go to the contraption. Getting within range of the beacons givesHaste,Jump Boost,Regeneration,Resistance,Speed, andStrength(9/27).
7. Eat the golden apple to getAbsorption(10/27). Timer is now at most 2 minutes.
8. Enter the contraption and close the fence gate to enter the swimming position and getConduit Power(11/27).
9. Sprint-swim (givingDolphin's Grace(12/27)) over the shrieker (which will activate and giveDarkness(13/27)) and toward the wither rose in the gap between the grindstones to getWither(14/27). The shulker will also begin firing at you, giving youLevitation(15/27). Continue sprint-swimming toward the wither rose throughout the rest of the steps.
10. Flip the lever to the right of the wither rose to trigger the dispenser behind you to shoot a spectral arrow at you (givingGlowing(19/27)) and to trigger the piston next to the lever to extend and activate an observer clock which quickly fires the potions in the upper dispenser, givingFire Resistance,Invisibility,Night Vision,Slowness,Slow Falling,Water Breathing, andWeakness(23/27). The lever can be flipped again to fire another spectral arrow if necessary.
11. Eat the pufferfish forHunger,Nausea, andPoison(26/27). Timer is now at most 15 seconds.
12. Eat the suspicious stew to getBlindness(27/27). This should grant the advancement. However, if Glowing expired before you could eat the suspicious stew, quickly flip the lever again to fire another spectral arrow and give glowing again. As long as you keep sprint-swimming at the wither rose, Wither, Levitation, Darkness, Conduit Power, Dolphin's Grace, and the six beacon effects can all be refreshed (though triggering the sculk shrieker too many times runs the risk of potentially spawning a warden).

This is a hidden advancement, meaning that it can only be viewed when the player has completed the advancement.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 1000 experience, which is the equivalent of 26 levels if the player previously had no experience. This is the most experience that a player can get by completing any advancement.
