## Sound of Music
Make the Meadows come alive with the sound of music from a Jukebox

Requirements: Play a music disc in a jukebox located in a meadow biome.

First, craft a jukebox:

| Ingredients            | Crafting recipe |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| AnyPlanks+<br/>Diamond |                 |

Then, obtain any music disc. There are sixteen different discs. Twelve of them can be dropped by creepers when killed by a skeleton or a stray, other four can be found only as loot in certain generated structures: 

- "Pigstep" can be found inbastionchests,
- "otherside" generates in chests indungeons,strongholdsandancient cities,
- "5" can be crafted fromdisc fragments, found in chests in ancient cities,
- "Relic" can bebrushedfromsuspicious gravelintrail ruins.

After you get a music disc, find a meadow biome. Place your jukebox in the meadow and play your music disc in it by using the disc on the jukebox. You will then get the advancement.

## Light as a Rabbit
Walk on Powder Snow...without sinking in it

Requirement: Walk on powder snow using leather boots

You need a pair of leather boots. They can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Leather     |                 |

You can also rarely obtain a pair of leather boots by killing a zombie, husk, stray or skeleton that was wearing them, trading with villagers, fishing or by finding them in village or shipwreck chests.

Then, either obtain or locate powder snow. It spawns naturally in groves and snowy slopes on the sides of mountains. It can be distinguished from regular snow block by its texture; also, snow layers don't accumulate on top of powder snow, which helps to differentiate between snow variants. 

You can also obtain powder snow by placing a cauldron in a snowy biome. Make sure it has exposure to the sky, and then wait for it to snow, as it will fill with powder snow during snowy weather. Note, however, that the cauldron can take a really long time to fill up. Once the cauldron is full, you can use a bucket to remove the powder snow from the cauldron and place it elsewhere.

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Iron Ingot  |                 |

Once you have found or placed the powder snow, equip your leather boots and stand on top of it. You will not sink into the powder snow, and you will get the advancement.

Look at the Ender Dragon through a spyglass

Requirements: Zoom in on the ender dragon while holding a spyglass.

The third of spyglass advancements (see Is It a Bird? and Is It a Balloon?) requires you to look through it at the ender dragon. This can be either the original dragon or a respawned one. Other advancements related to the dragon, defeating and respawning it are explained in this part of advancement tutorial.

| Ingredients                      | Crafting recipe |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Amethyst Shard+<br/>Copper Ingot |                 |

Once you zoom in on the dragon, you will be granted the advancement.

## Very Very Frightening
Strike a Villager with lightning

Requirements: Hit a villager with lightning created by a trident with the Channeling enchantment.

First, you need a trident enchanted with Channeling. For more information on how to get the trident, see A Throwaway Joke. Next, find a villager and trap it. The villager can't have any blocks above its head, or, in other words, it must have a direct sky access. Also, the villager can't touch water, otherwise lightning will not strike it.

Now you need to wait for a thunderstorm. Note that they are quite a rare event and can last for a very brief amount of time. When the thunder starts, throw your trident at the villager: a lightning will strike it and you will get the advancement.

## Sniper Duel
Kill a Skeleton from at least 50 meters away

Requirements: Be at least 50 blocks away from a skeleton and kill it with a projectile.

Kill a skeleton with a projectile that is shot from at least 50 blocks away horizontally. The best way to do this is to first trap a skeleton in a smallest possible area using fences, so that you don't have to deal with a moving target. Also, make sure that it is nighttime so that the skeleton will not burn in the daytime. Alternatively, if the skeleton has a helmet on or a block above its head, it will not burn in the daylight; however, its helmet will eventually break from the daylight. To ensure that the skeleton doesn't despawn, put a name tag on it.

Then back away at least 50 blocks from the skeleton, horizontallyâ€”you can use the debug screen to see your coordinates in the world. From that point shoot at about a 45 degree angle toward the skeleton. You can also reduce your FOV to aim better. It may take many tries to shoot correctly. You will get the advancement once the skeleton is killed by the projectile.

To weaken the skeleton and kill it in one hit with your projectile, you can hit it with another weapon for a certain number of times, until you can hit the skeleton with the projectile in one hit. You will get the advancement as long as when the skeleton is killed and it was hit by your arrow at last. If you have an iron sword, diamond sword, netherite sword, or any type of axe (except netherite), you can hit the skeleton twice with that weapon before shooting the skeleton with a fully charged arrow in one hit. If you have a wooden, stone, or gold sword, hit the skeleton three times with that weapon before shooting the skeleton. A bow enchanted with Power IV or V can kill a full health skeleton in one hit. 

Although arrows are the easiest to get, any projectile can be used for this advancement: for example, tridents work as well, and it is a bit easier to aim with them.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 50 experience.
