### Nether wastes
The nether wastes is a biome that is a barren netherrack cavern with little to offer in terms of survival.

#### Pros
- If the player has gold armor to wear andgold ingotsto trade, the nether wastes is a safer alternative forpiglinbartering than the crimson forest, ashoglinsare absent from this biome.
- It ties with the soul sand valley as the biome with the most open skyline, and this biome is much safer than the soul sand valley.
- The previous point also allows for plenty of space for the player to built.

#### Cons
- There is no food to be found in this biome, aside from what can be obtained from piglin bartering. The player may need to bring food from another biome.
- Piglins andghastscan cause trouble for players who are unprepared.Zombified piglinsalso spawn here commonly, although they are neutral and attack only if they are attacked by the player.

#### Useful resources
Bartering loot are useful resources found in nether wastes.

### Warped forest
The easiest of the new biomes introduced to settle down in is the warped forest. This is a fairly crowded forest of blue warped fungi trees, which provide a blue-tinted wood that can be used in place of Overworld wood types to make a crafting station, sticks, tools, etc. Endermen are the only hostile mob to spawn in this biome, and combat can be avoided if players are careful to not look near their eyes. Bringing a carved pumpkin to protect yourself from endermen is also recommended.

#### Pros
- It is the least hostile Nether biome.
- Wood can be obtained from blue warped fungi trees, a necessary material for long term survival.
- Nether fortresses cannot generate in a warped forest biome (although they can generate into one if a neighboring biome generates the fortress), meaning blazes, wither skeletons, and normal skeletons are unlikely to be encountered.
- As with all Nether biomes, striders spawn in the lava lakes in this biome. For the player's safety, this is the best biome to house them in.
- Thewarped fungifound in this biome can be used to ward offhoglinsin the crimson forest.
- Twisting vinesare a flora that grows upward-similarly to kelp-that can be climbed like a ladder. Unlike ladders, they do not require a support block to be placed (aside from the block the bottom vine is placed on), meaning they are excellent for scaling cliffs or reaching higher levels of the Nether.
- Thanks to the increased spawning of Endermen in this biome compared to the rest of the Nether, this biome makes an efficient place to gather ender pearls.

#### Cons
- Due to endermen and striders being the only mobs to spawn here, food cannot be obtained from killing mobs. No crops can be obtained here either, meaning the only option for food is for players to venture to another biome to forage/hunt.
- Bastionscan generate in this biome, meaning piglins may be a threat if the forest the player settles in happens to have one.

#### Useful resources
Warped stems, warped fungi, twisting vines and ender pearls are useful resources found in the warped forest.

### Crimson forest
The crimson forest is a red counterpart to the warped forest, with more dangerous mobs inhabiting it. While this makes surviving mobs harder than in the warped forest, the crimson forest offers food options that the warped forest cannot. It is up to the player to decide which of the two biomes is more desirable. Piglins inhabit this biome, meaning the player must equip at least one piece of gold armor to prevent them from attacking on sight. Piglins also become angered whenever opening a chest or mining nether gold ore within their line of sight, so the player may want to enclose their chests in a windowless room to prevent piglin attacks.

#### Pros
- Wood can be obtained from red crimson fungi trees, a necessary material for long term survival.
- If the player has gold armor to wear and gold ingots to spare, piglins can be bartered with for many useful items. SeeBarteringfor more information on what items can be obtained.
- Hoglins, while dangerous hostile mobs, are a renewable source of pork if farmed. They can be bred withcrimson fungi, although the player must take care to build a safe farm area for themselves.
- Theweeping vinesin this biome are the crimson forest equivalent of the warped forest's twisting vines. Unlike the twisting vines, weeping vines grow downward from the underside of a block, instead of upward. This makes them more suited for creating a safe way down a cliff or ceiling, if used carefully.

#### Cons
- As stated previously, piglins and hoglins are potential threats, especially hoglins who cannot be pacified with gold like piglins. However, they can be warded off with warped fungi. If the player does not have gold to pacify piglins, they can similarly be warded off withsoul firerelated items.
- Bastion remnants and nether fortresses can generate in this biome, potentially making the forest much more dangerous.
- Mining gold ore or opening a chest near piglins causes them to become hostile towards the player, whether or not they are wearing gold armor or have soul related items nearby.

#### Useful resources
Crimson stems, crimson fungi, weeping vines, hoglins and bartering loot are useful resources found in the crimson forest.

### Soul sand valley
Soul sand valleys are by far the most trying biome to live in among the Nether biomes. The biome is coated in a floor of soul sand, making traversing slow. Skeletons and ghasts spawn frequently here, which when combined with the slowing nature of soul sand, can be dangerous to the player. Soul fire is present in this biome, and occurs whenever soul sand or soil is set on fire. It deals double the damage of normal fire, but using soul sand/soil in certain crafting recipes can allow the player to craft soul fire variants of useful blocks, such as soul torches and soul campfires.
