### Sniper Duel

Goal: Kill a skeleton by shooting it from a distance of at least 50 blocks.

Find a large flat area on the surface. Dig a trench one and a half blocks deep, two blocks wide and several blocks long. Line the trench with light. Just over 50 meters away from the lip of the trench, make a tower 15 blocks high. When night comes, wait for a skeleton to fall into the trench or lure it in. Then from your tower, aim just above the skeleton, about halfway between it and the horizon, and fire from full charge until it dies. With a Flame enchantment, you can see where your arrows landed better and can adjust your aim easier, but the skeleton might die of the fire, not giving the achievement.



### 

Goal: Construct a Wooden Pickaxe.

Make sure that you have 3 planks and 2 sticks in your inventory.

Arrange the ingredients like so or click the wooden pickaxe button in the recipe book to craft a wooden pickaxe:

| Ingredients        | Input » Output |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Wood Planks+Sticks |                |



### Getting an Upgrade

Use your new wooden pickaxe to mine some stone, which in return you will receive cobblestone. Make sure that you have 2 sticks in your inventory.

| Ingredients        | Input » Output |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Cobblestone+Sticks |                |



### Overpowered

Goal: Eat an Enchanted Apple.

These can not be crafted as of 1.9. You must now find them in desert temple, dungeon, mineshaft, bastion remnant, ruined portal, or woodland mansion.



### Hot Topic

Goal: Construct a furnace.

Mine 8 blocks of cobblestone and open your crafting table. Arrange the cobblestone like so to craft a furnace:

| Ingredients | Input » Output |
|-------------|----------------|
| Cobblestone |                |



### Delicious Fish

Goal: Obtain the item that gets created after cooking fish.

The easiest way to catch a fish is to swim underwater and using a sword, attacking the salmon/cod.

Alternatively, you can craft and use a fishing rod. Cast your rod into a water body, then right-click so the "bait" lands into the water, and wait till it comes closer to the rod and right-click again when you hear a splash sound. The fish fly toward you and probably will be picked up by you too. 

At last, put the cod or salmon you got in the furnace with fuel like so:

| Ingredients                           | Smelting recipe |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Raw Codor<br/>Raw Salmon+<br/>Anyfuel |                 |



### Acquire Hardware

Goal: Pick up an iron ingot.

Mine iron ore with a stone pickaxe, and put it in the furnace like so:

| Ingredients           | Smelting recipe |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Raw Iron+<br/>Anyfuel |                 |

Alternatively you can find them in various loot chests, and are also a rare drop from zombies.



### On a Rail

Goal: Travel 500 blocks with a minecart from where you started.

It will take at least 192 iron ingots as well as 32 sticks to craft enough rails (512 or 8 stacks). Alternatively, you can find and break them in mineshafts or woodland mansions. Then, build a continuous track so that a minecart can travel the full distance. Afterward, place a minecart on the start of the track, then travel from the start to the end without leaving the minecart.
The achievement does not allow you to repeatedly loop the same section of the track.

You will most likely need powered rails to get this achievement. These will take additional resources. You can also make a gradual decline from a great height to use gravity instead of powered rails.



### 

Goal: Pick up a diamond.

Look in various loot chests or search below layer 16 for diamond ore (layer 5-12 is also good, layer 12 is the best; press F3 to see your coordinates) and destroy it using your iron pickaxe. Creeper or TNT explosions have a chance of dropping the diamond as well. Mineshafts are extremely useful for this achievement.

Arrange the ingredients like so to craft an iron pickaxe:

| Ingredients       | Input » Output |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Iron Ingot+Sticks |                |



### 

Goal: Throw a diamond at another player.

Drop/throw a diamond at another player using Q or the key that you use.



### Enchanter

Goal: Craft an Enchantment Table

Make a diamond pickaxe so you can mine at least 4 obsidian (or find it in various loot chests):

| Ingredients     | Input » Output |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Diamonds+Sticks |                |

Then get 3 paper and 1 leather, the paper being made from sugar canes like so:

| Ingredients | Input » Output |
|-------------|----------------|
| Sugar Cane  | 3              |

Then craft a book like so:

| Ingredients   | Input » Output |
|---------------|----------------|
| Leather+Paper |                |

Arrange the ingredients like so to craft an enchantment table:

| Ingredients           | Input » Output |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Book+Diamond+Obsidian |                |



### Librarian

Goal: Construct a bookshelf.

Make sure you have 6 planks and 3 books in your inventory,

Arrange the ingredients like so to craft a bookshelf:

| Ingredients      | Input » Output |
|------------------|----------------|
| Wood Planks+Book |                |

To achieve the maximum potential from the enchantment table, place 15 bookshelves 1 block away from the enchantment table (in a box shape), like this:



|  |  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |

Although not required, this is the most efficient method to acquire the highest enchantment possible. Any additional bookshelves around the enchantment table beyond 15 will not increase the maximum level beyond 30 and will only serve aesthetic purposes.
