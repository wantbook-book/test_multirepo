# Tutorials/Nether hub
Often, players in the Overworld have good reason to travel thousands of blocks from one place to another, costing both time and resources. In these situations, the Nether can be used to significantly reduce the length of a journey. This is due to the fact that coordinates in the Overworld are 8x the value of the coordinates in the Nether, meaning that every one block traveled in the Nether translates to eight blocks traveled in the Overworld.

## Introduction
When players build important structures in other biomes, they often travel to these structures via minecart, boat, elytra, riding a horse, or by walking; however, a much quicker alternative is to use a nether portal.

Once you've made two nether portals in the Nether connecting to two different places in the Overworld, you can make a minecart railway or a boat-way made of packed ice or blue ice to get from one to another for even quicker travel.

### Materials
Assuming you already have access to the Nether, you will need the following materials for a single linked portal:

- 10obsidianat minimum (without filling corners)
- Aflint and steel,fire charge, or something else that can set the inside of thenether portalonfire.
- A few stacks of blast-proof blocks, such as Cobblestone

You will also need to know how the coordinate system works.

## Steps
### Easiest and cheapest method
The most straightforward way to connect two Overworld locations for faster travel via the Nether is as follows:

1. Find the coordinates of the portal you want to use, then divide the X and Z values by 8. Note these divided values, along with the unchanged Y value.

2. Enter the Nether via a (relatively) far-away portal, bringing materials to build and light a new Nether Portal.

3. Head to the divided coordinates in the Nether. Try to place yourself at about the same Y coordinate (elevation), then make a second portal. You should come out at about the location you wanted to go.

4. (optional) Move your exit portal to the location corresponding to your Nether portal. (Multiply the X and Z coordinates by 8.) This makes it less likely that new linked portals will attempt to link to this existing portal.

(Note that this method can have problems with linking to existing portals that are nearby the target destination.)(If the portal links to an existing portal, you may need to travel to the target location on foot. Don't worry: portals "forget" their links every 60 seconds.)

You can also let a website like https://gamertools.net/tools/3 calculate the nether/overworld coordinates for you.

### Example
For example, say that your spawn is at X = 92, Y = 66, and Z = 45. You have found a village at coordinates X = 1054, Y = 78, and Z = -786 and wish to connect the two. Divide the X and Z of the village coordinates by 8, to get roughly X = 132 and Z = -98. Then, make a Nether portal at spawn, go through and travel to X = 132 and Z = -98 in the Nether, and up to Y=78. Make your Nether portal here, and when you go through into the Overworld, you should come out at or near the village.

### More precise method
The above method does not let you choose exactly where your second portal appears in the Overworld, and is more likely to link to an existing portal that is already nearby your target destination. This method allows you to do so, but is more expensive and time-consuming as it requires you to build an extra portal at your desired exit coordinates.

1. Travel to your desired exit point, and build a portal there. Don't forget to light it!
2. Divide the X and Z coordinates of your desired exit point by 8 as above, and note them, along with the Y.
3. Go through an existing portal, bringing enough materials to build and light a new one, and head to those divided coordinates in the Nether.
4. After building the portal, go through it. You should come out the Overworld portal at your destination.

## Comparing coordinates
Compare the following 2 pictures. The first one shows coordinates in the Overworld at a nether portal. The second one shows the corresponding coordinates in the Nether. You will notice that the Overworld X and Z coordinates are about 8 times the coordinates in the Nether, although sometimes they may be slightly off.





## Multiple Portals
If you have multiple locations in the overworld that you want to be easily accessible, then just travel to the location in the nether, build a portal, and travel through it. You should come out about where you wanted to go. If you have an exact spot you want the overworld portal to go that is close to where the portal generated, you can just remove the overworld portal and build a new one in your desired location. If you are running low on obsidian, you may want to consider taking the corners off of the generated portal. It may not look as nice, but it will give you four extra blocks of obsidian. To improve the look of the portal, place cheaper blocks such as wood blocks or chiseled stone bricks.
