### Roof and lintels
The third level of the house (3 blocks high) is as below. Use dirt or sandstone for these blocks above the doorways, window openings, and forming the roof, as they need to ignore gravity whenever there is air beneath them. 

If you did not find dirt, craft some sandstone right away. You can easily create 16 sandstone from the sand you dug out of the trenches. You need a minimum of 12, but 16 is an efficient number (craft 64 sand) and allows some spare in case you make a mistake. Running out of sandstone can get you killed on your first night!

### Roof defenses
If you have enough time and materials, complete the 4 corners as 4-high sand pillars (sticking up one block above roof level) and put cacti on the corners.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

If you don't have time or materials to do the corners, don't worry about it, do it the next day. If you have even more time and materials, add a second set of 4 cacti, each raised on one block of sand to match the others. This is so they are safe for you to bump into, but not safe for spiders to climb over.

You now have a spider-resistant roof that will grow into a semi-lethal spider trap in a day or so.

### Interior finish
It's probably dark by now, so get inside, but you can make some finishing touches on the inside of the house for added safety. Dig down one block in each of the interior corners. This gives you stress-free space to hide if mobs get close, or from ranged attacks. Leave the blocks by the windows and doors in place so you are able to look out. Leave the one sand block in the center of the house in place so you can pillar-jump up through your skylight to take a quick, careful look around.

Keep a few blocks of sand handy in your inventory for pillar jumping. And in case you get really freaked out and just want to rest, you can block up the 'window' openings.

### Day 2 and 3
If you develop your shelter by adding an outer ditch (spaced 3 blocks further out), and add denser layers of cacti, and finally a pillar to help you navigate home, it will look something like this:

- Day 2, with second trench and a low-density cactus wall.
- Day 3, with a navigation pillar and a few more cacti.
- Dusk of Day 3, with a denser wall of cacti.

### Cobblestone spruce
Materials

1 spruce sapling, bonemeal, 1 lava bucket, 1 water bucket, 1 door, 1 fireproof block.

Description
You don't use many items to build this shelter, and this shelter is fireproof.

Location
Anywhere where is a small amount of trees nearby and the surface under leaves of the spruce tree is on one layer.

Construction
Place spruce sapling (Optional: Use bonemeal to grow it faster). Place block on top of the spruce tree. Next, place lava on top of that block. Wait for lava to go to surface (you can wait longer than that, as well). Place water on block that you placed in point two. Wait to water change all lava to cobblestone. Take water. Mine 2Ã—1 hole on the wall. Place door in it. Ta-da! shelter finished using 5 items.

### Freestanding
Materials

64-256 wood planks, cobblestone, stone

Description

These freestanding shelters are not usually the first shelter that the player builds, because it usually consumes the time fast. These shelters provide good protection against mobs.

Location

You can build these type of shelters anywhere where there is flat ground. You can also clear out a flat area, but this will consume more time and leave you vulnerable in the night if you don't have your house built in time.

Construction

The size of the shelter is decided by you, the player. The foundation can be any size you want, but a bigger building will take more time to complete and, hey, the sun doesn't stay in the sky forever! First, make the foundation of the building as wide as you want. Then, you can make a wooden floor, or you can just keep the ground as your floor. Jump and place a block underneath you to make the shelter taller. When your shelter is complete, you can make access to the rooftop, if you like. Placing a door or fence gate at the entrance is important because without one, the aggressive mobs can come inside your house and kill you. Also, make sure your shelter is well lit to avoid mobs spawning inside; the bigger your house is, however, the more torches you need. A lantern provide slightly more illumination than a torch.

Extras

- Watchtower (used for sniping and looking for resources)
- Windows
- Greenhouse (SeeFarming)
- Skylight (extra light and mobs can't spawn on it. Also looks really cool!)
