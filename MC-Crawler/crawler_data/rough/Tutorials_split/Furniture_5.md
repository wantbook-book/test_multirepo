### Shelves
Building a shelf is simple. all you need to do is place a trap door where you want your shelf to go, and you're finished!

You could also place slabs on a wall. That way you can put things on them, such as a cake.

Placing stairs upside down allows functional stair shelves.
Blocks are split into two halves (thus two slabs of the same material make 1 block) so point your cursor at the TOP HALF of the block you want your shelf against and place your stair; if you aim lower it will be right-side-up and you have to replace it. If you aimed for the top half of the placement block it will become upside-down and you can make non-floating cake holders. This way you can skip the trouble of placing a block and your stair and removing the reference block. Place them outside under a window for a windowsill, or maybe even use several with crafting tables mixed in for a cat tree.

### Ceiling fan
Place any block on the ceiling, then put 4 trapdoors on each side of the block to give it the look of a ceiling fan.

### Piano
Need some music in your house? Here's how to make a piano that plays music or just notes.

All you need is:

- 2Nether brick stairs
- 1Note block
- 1Jukebox
- SeveralMusic discs

Now to the building:

1. Dig a 2×4 hole in the ground.
2. Put a note block and a jukebox in the hole.
3. Put two upside-down nether brick stairs on the note block and on the jukebox (or put black and white carpets on 2 quartz stairs).
4. Now you have your fully functional piano!

#### Concert piano
1. Put down a fence and black wool.
2. Behind the first piece, put another and one to the right of it. On the right piece, put another fence.
3. Do that one more time but do three wool pieces.
4. Put quartz stairs facing you (3 of them).
5. Put down two of any block as a bench.

or

1. Put down two blocks of black wool next to each other.
2. Then on the left of these blocks place three blocks of black wool one in front of the other.
3. Next on top of the first two blocks you placed, place two more blocks.
4. After that on top of all of your black wool place black carpet.
5. On the second three blocks you placed, place another layer of carpet on those three blocks.
6. In front of the first two blocks of black wool you placed, place two blocks of note blocks next two each other.
7. Then do the same on top of it
8. In front of those blocks place two blocks of nether brick stairs

Notes for the below diagram:

- The nether brick stairs indicate stairs going from north to south and the oak stairs (which should actually be nether brick stairs) are stairs going from south to north.
- The nether brick slabs indicate normal slabs and the oak slabs (which should actually be nether brick slabs) are upside down slabs.
- The chest has a jukebox under it.

- And that's how it's made!

### Cool fences
To make a "cool" fence, place a stair where you want your fence to go, then place a slab block on top of each stair. Glass panes, iron bars and cobblestone walls with slabs on top will also work.

## Kitchen
A kitchen may consist of a small chest with food products, such as meats, bread, or raw ingredients. You may wish to add a crafting table as well as a few furnaces, to simulate a working area and an oven. Counters are made by placing the stone, stone brick, or wood plank blocks in any manner a real-world kitchen would be placed in. Also, the kitchen should be placed on cobblestone or stone brick floors, rather than wood plank floors. For a more fancy floor, use polished andesite and polished granite, or black and white wool.

You may also make a fridge by placing a dispenser on the floor, an iron block on top, and an iron door in front. Then just place a button next to the dispenser, and when you press it, the iron door will open, and the dispenser will dispense your food! If you have a slanted roof put a 2×1 hole in the ceiling near the wall and over the counter and put two stair blocks there and make it look like there are just two solid blocks there. Then, put a large chest underneath it and you got yourself a cabinet!
