###### Liquid Walls
Liquid walls are walls, which are coated on the outside with a layer of water or lava. While they can allow mobs to enter the liquid and float over the top (undead mobs will sink), they can be used as a damage dealer by drowning or burning them. They can also prevent creepers, ghasts and player-made TNT cannons outside the walls from breaking the wall, and water also prevents endermen from taking blocks out of the wall. While liquid walls are much harder to break than regular walls, though, it is still recommended to build an overhang structure to prevent climbing mobs.

##### Waterlogged Blast-resistant Walls
If you are low in resources and don't want to compromise your building look, you can position stairs so it looks like a full block from the outside, then waterlogging them (other waterloggable block will work). The blast-resistant ability is similar to liquid walls.

##### Walls on demand
The following video shows how to make a large cobblestone wall semi-automatically, using water and lava:

### Cheap mob proof doorway
Here is a cheap mob proof door that can double as a mob trap. However, be careful when using this if you have pets, as it will kill any pets that are sitting.

This method doesn't work in versions 1.13 and later of Java Edition.




### Pufferfish
Dig a block two blocks deep, fill the bottom block with water, and insert a pufferfish into the water block. Fill the top block with the block of the surrounding or a block of your choice. Any mob (including the player) that comes over it will get poisoned by the pufferfish's defense.

### Moats and Ditches
These obstacles, like walls, present a vertical barrier to incoming (and outgoing) mobs and players. The difference between a moat and a ditch is that a moat usually has water or lava at the bottom.

Dry ditches, like walls, should be at least three blocks tall on the inside edge, with an overhang or protrusions to prevent spiders from climbing them. They should also be at least three blocks wide at their narrowest point in order to prevent spiders from jumping over them. It is recommended that players leave a means of escaping the ditch to the outside (not the inside, which would defeat the purpose of a ditch), in the event that they are knocked into it by injuries, explosions or simple mistakes. 

Moats are constructed identically to ditches, but they are additionally filled with either water or lava, with the specific liquid depending on whether harming the mobs or obtaining their drops is required. A water-filled moat, if constructed correctly, can be built into a drowning tank to kill mobs. The down side to this is that a player needs to be nearby to lure mobs into the water, and the AI for mobs makes it hard to do this. On another note, water-filled moats will still slow mobs down allowing them to be easily picked off with a bow and some arrows, after which the player can swim out and pick them up, or have water currents deliver them to a pick-up point. 

Moats can also be made so that water currents push mobs away; while this makes the moat ill-suited for drop collection, any mob which lands in it will be directed away from the wall, since mobs do not resist water currents, unless they are trying to attack the player.

With the introduction of the new water mechanics in 1.13, moats can be mixed with magma blocks to create an effective mob killing system, as bottom of the magma block will create whirlpool bubble columns that pull a mob to the bottom and then proceed to both pin them at the bottom and deal damage. If you wish to collect any drops created, use a minecart with hopper on a powered rail one directly underneath the magma block to collect the drops and deposit them into a storage system.

A lava-filled moat, on the other hand, will kill any mobs in short order by itself, but also destroy any drops. Lava-moats have the additional benefit of producing light, stopping mobs from spawning nearby without torches. However, it can be laborious to collect large quantities of lava, which requires at minimum buckets and the discovery of a sizable source of lava. Structures over a lava moat (bridges, overhanging walls, etc.) should have fences or a raised edge to stop players from falling or being knocked in. Lava should not be used where there are flammable blocks nearby, especially trees, planks blocks, or wool (among others).

Cobweb ditches are more compact than regular ones. They are one block deep and one block wide ditches filled with cobwebs. Mobs get stuck in the cobwebs, immobilizing them to be killed. They can be easily jumped over. This ditch is useful for making a border for your safe area, the outside of which does not need lit up. Cobwebs are found in mineshafts, stronghold library, spider spawner rooms of woodland mansions, and zombie villages. Note: spiders and cave spiders can move freely in cobwebs without being stuck, also some mobs capable of ranged attack can still attack player even though they are stuck in a cobweb.




### Fire
Walls and ditches of all types can be enhanced with burning netherrack. The base and/or top of walls can be lined with the burning block. Mobs running into the wall stand in the flames, while those that make it over the wall must pass through flames on the way. 

A ditch is easily enhanced in the same way, with the row of fire placed either before the ditch, so that burning mobs fall into the ditch and cannot escape (leaving drops to be collected later), or in the base of the ditch itself, where drops may be destroyed by the fire.

Take note that by itself burning netherrack is not an effective barrier, as many mobs that have more health points can run through the flames and attack the player before burning to death. Combining cacti with netherrack is rather effective. Another option would be to put multiple rows of netherrack with fire, allowing mobs to burn for a longer period of time.
Magma blocks also work, as it can hurt mobs that step on it plus fire will burn indefinitely on magma block, similar to netherrack.
