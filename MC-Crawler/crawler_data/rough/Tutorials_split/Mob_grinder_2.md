### Piston grinder
See also: Damage § Suffocation

Example setup of a piston smasher trap.
Using pistons, it is possible to push blocks into mobs so that they suffocate. In the shown example design, a piston pushes a mob underneath a sticky piston holding a block. The sticky piston extends at the same time to "smash" the mob and cause it to die from suffocation at 2 points per second. The water used to push the mobs can also be used to wash the items to a hopper for item collection. This setup works only for tall mobs, but the same principle can be used for smaller mobs as well.

The downside to this trap is the slow rates of kills, since each mob needs about 10 seconds of suffocation before it dies. This problem can be fixed by having a row of pistons push together at once, suffocating multiple mobs in every smash. Another downside is the inability to handle spiders. You must find another way to sort out spiders, such as a cactus choke.

Timing is important for this trap to work efficiently. For single mob smashes, a loop of at least 30 repeaters set at maximum are needed, giving 12 seconds per loop. With this setup, turn on the loop for a little more than 10 seconds to ensure they die, and have the loop off for the rest, giving 10 second kills and 2 second load times. For a full row of 8 pistons, the load time is approximately 6 seconds, meaning the loop needs to have 40 repeaters giving a 16-second loop. Load time for a stream of 8 blocks long and 2 blocks wide, with pistons on both sides, is about 8 seconds. This amounts to at least 48 repeaters.

## Alternative grinders
These grinders are not as commonly used and may be somewhat unusual. They can still be useful in some situations, however.

### Entity cramming grinder

  

This tutorial is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


It is possible to kill mobs using entity cramming. When there are more entities sharing a hitbox than the value set in the Entity cramming threshold setting (default 24), if they cannot be pushed apart, they start to take damage. This grinder deals 6 damage per second, quickly killing mobs such as skeletons and zombies after about 3 seconds of exposure. Because this trap deals suffocation damage, it works with all mobs, including those which are immune to fire and lava, such as wither skeletons.

To make the grinder, first dig a 1×1 pit at least two blocks deep so mobs cannot jump out. As mobs fall into the hole, their number will eventually accumulate to the point where they pass the cramming threshold and start taking damage. Collect the items with hoppers or hopper minecarts, as with any other grinder. When the farm is turned off and the density of mobs in the hole isn't high enough, they remain stuck in the chamber, but they can be finished off with a sword.

No experience is gained from this farm, aside from killing the leftover mobs manually. However, it is cheap, simple, easy to build, and can kill almost anything. Just don't fall in.

### Cactus choke
A cactus choke design
This cactus choke kills spiders, solving potential spider size/jump/climbing issues. It is a simple design, relying on the spider's 2×2 size. The grinder stops all spiders at a bottleneck, where the water-conveyor narrows from 2 blocks wide to 1 block. A cactus is placed on the side, on top of a sand block, where spiders run into it. This grinder works well, but the cactus can destroy some of the loot.

### Sunlight grinder
It is possible to burn zombies and skeletons with sunlight as an effective way of dealing damage and separating creepers. This can also be done with monster spawners. To build a sunlight grinder, simply make a room with a glass or a hollow ceiling. Although it is easy to build, this grinder has several downsides:

- It works only during daytime, making the grinder useless at night and when overcast.
- It requires an area where sky access is possible.
- It requires the kill chamber to be separated from water.
- It works only with certain mobs.




### Mob arena
Strictly speaking, this is not a mob grinder, but has a similar outcome and is a fun way of using the mobs spawned from a mob farm. The mobs are collected in chambers and can be slowly released into an arena to fight against players.

The concept is simple: 2 tall buildings, with about 15 rooms inside, that have holes at all corners, and water around the sides to push anything that goes to the side into the hole at the corner. Then once the mobs fall down, they are trapped in a simple holding area until a lever is pulled to let pistons open so that the mobs can fall out.




### Anvil smasher
It is possible to grind mobs by smashing them with an anvil. To start, the mobs should be contained in a small 1×1 chamber with an open ceiling. Next you should have a tall pillar on one wall chamber which you can climb and drop an anvil from. If dropped from a sufficient height, all mobs should be instantly slaughtered. You can then collect the drops with a hopper or just by entering the chamber. You may wish to place a torch or sign at the bottom of the chamber to break the anvil and prevent it from being damaged. It would then be possible to automatically transport the items and anvil back up to the top using some sort of vertical item transportation.
