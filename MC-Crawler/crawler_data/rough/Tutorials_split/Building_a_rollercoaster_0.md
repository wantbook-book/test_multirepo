## Components
### Rail Type
To maintain top speed throughout your ride, all straight sections of a roller coaster should consist of powered rails activated by means of redstone torches or levers. These redstone power sources can be placed on a block adjacent to or hidden underneath the block that the powered rail is placed on. A single redstone torch or lever will activate 8 connected powered rails in each direction in addition to the rail immediately adjacent to or above it, thus powering up to 17 rails on a track when positioned in the center of a given section. Detector rails can also be used to power 1-3 powered rails when a player is riding the coaster, with the added bonus of sending a redstone signal under or next to the block it's placed on. This creates opportunities for the player to utilize other redstone-powered blocks in their build. Powered activator rails will dismount the player upon passing over one. Only normal rails can guarantee the success of a turn.

#### Realistic railing
Most real-life roller coasters only use powered rails to climb the first hill, using the energy from the descent of that hill to move the car along the rest of the track. This can be achieved in Minecraft as well: simply place powered rails up the first hill (along with your choice of redstone power source) and make the rest of the track from plain rails. The minecart should be able to make it around the whole track, as long as each hill is not as big as the previous one. Note that, if you choose to follow this model, your riders will not maintain top speed throughout the entirety of the ride.

### Station
A minecart at the end of a roller coaster track. When the button to the right is pressed, the minecart will roll to the station.
A roller coaster typically starts with a station, which requires a way to start and stop a minecart. One simple example involves placing a block on the ground where you would like your station to begin and putting a piece of plain rail on top of it. Next to that block, go down one block (to ground level) and place an inactivated piece of powered rail, so that it appears to slope down from the plain rail. Then, place either another piece of powered rail or another plain rail next to it. Put a minecart on the slope of the inactivated powered rail. While inactivated, the powered rail will hold the minecart in place against the pull of gravity.

Once this is done, build a 2-block-high pillar next to the sloping rail. Place a button on the uppermost block, facing the powered rail. When you right-click the button, the powered rail will turn on, allowing the minecart to move forward.

Stations can include a variety of complex features. For example, many builds include a switcher, allowing the minecart to go on a different railway into a station separate from the roller coaster.

### Track
A common way to design a track for a roller coaster involves placing blocks where you want the track to go and then placing the rails and powered rails on top of those blocks. For a more realistic-looking roller coaster, place support beams along the length of the ride and conceal redstone power sources under the track.

Rails can be placed on any fully-solid opaque block, as well as on top of hoppers, upside-down blocks of stairs, and upside-down slabs. However, if you are planning to conceal redstone power sources underneath your track, avoid using blocks that follow the laws of gravity, such as sand, concrete powder and gravel. (Note that these blocks can be used otherwise, as long as they are supported underneath by any block that does not fall when unsupported.) In Survival mode, consider using common or renewable materials.

### Tunnels
Tunnels allow you to move a rider safely through an obstacle, including natural features of the terrain, such as a mountain, water, or lava, the Nether, or anywhere else that an obstacle would otherwise block the way. If the roller coaster moves through The End, there is no way to protect the rider from the dragon without killing or teleporting it away when it draws near (which requires complex commands), except for a tunnel constructed fully of bedrock, which is impossible to obtain in Survival mode without the use of glitches.

Both water and lava will break any rail they come into contact with. (Water problem fixed in 1.17, but will slow down the minecart.) For maximum visual impact, you can construct a tunnel out of transparent blocks such as glass or barriers for moving through either of these fluids.

### Intersections
Intersections usually combine clever placing of rails with redstone. Intersections are based on the normal rail. If a normal rail is placed at a t-intersection between three rails, it will default to one particular side. Powering that rail, however, will switch to curve the other way.

### Drops
In Survival and Adventure mode, drops can be any height. No fall damage will come to the player. Alternatively, the rider can be driven in a boat, since boats negate fall damage as well. However, boats are more water based and are fun to ride with magma blocks and soul sand.
