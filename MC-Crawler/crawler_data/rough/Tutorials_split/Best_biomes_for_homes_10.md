#### Useful resources
Snow, ice, wood, ferns, igloos, wolves, sweet berries, villages‌[Bedrock Edition  only] and their loot, pillager outposts and their loot, and foxes are useful resources found in snowy taiga biomes.

#### Tips
- It is advised to build here only if you do not mind snow on buildings.
- Do not attack wolves, as any other wolves nearby also come and attack you; also, there is little point in killing them, as they drop only a little experience upon death.
- Tame a lot of wolves, as they offer excellent protection. Zombies and skeletons droprotten flesh(for feeding them) andbones(for taming them) respectively. Wolves also scare skeletons away.
- To completely chop the tall trees, try topillar jumpor cut it in a spiral staircase.
- Many light sources melt snow and ice which can be used to keep the player's structures somewhat cleaner.
	- This can also be used to keep irrigation water in farms from freezing, including in village farms.
- You can come to this biome to gathersnowballsas weapons againstblazesin the Nether.

#### Multiplayer
This is a good place to live in multiplayer. Both wood and food can be found here. Igloos make decent bases, and the villagers in their basement offer trades. Consider curing the zombie villager to get discounts on its trades, or alternatively take the brewing stand and golden apple. Wolves are good companions found here, and pillager outposts can generate too.

### Old growth pine taiga
The old growth pine taiga (a.k.a. the giant tree taiga) is a variant of the regular taiga which spawns with huge 2×2 trees. These trees have few leaves, but yield lots of wood. The ground here is made up of coarse dirt and dead bushes can be found, giving it a more "decaying" feel. There are many ferns and double ferns that may otherwise be rare, as well as podzol, which is a good alternative to mycelium (since mushrooms can be placed on it in the daytime). Mossy cobblestone spawns naturally here, making it unnecessary to use up shears to cut vines, if using mossy cobblestone for building. Like other taiga biomes, wolves can spawn in this biome.‌[JE  only] Foxes can also spawn.

#### Pros
- Spawnspodzol, which is a fairly hard-to-get resource.
- Comes with abundantmossy cobblestonewhich can be useful for aesthetic buildings.
- Wolves can be found and tamed here.
- Foxes can be found here.
- Coarse dirt can be found here (although it can also be crafted).
- Plenty of wood to go around.
- Plenty of mushrooms.

#### Cons
- Trees have relatively few leaves (hencesaplings) and can be hard to harvest due to their height and lack of foliage to stand on.
- Other than offering the rare podzol, coarse dirt or moss stone blocks, there is not much that this biome offers in terms of progressing through the game.
- Can house several hostile mobs in the shade of its trees.

#### Useful resources
Podzol, mossy cobblestone, ferns, wood, wolf, rabbits and foxes are useful resources found in giant tree taiga biomes.

#### Tips
- The trees give spruce wood. Since it's possible you may have started out somewhere with oak trees, keep in mind your inventory might become cluttered if you collect different types of wood and their plank variants.
- To cut down these trees, cut into it in a spiral pattern, making a thin spiral staircase all the way to the top. Then destroy the stairs as you go back down
- On the first day, you really need to cut down only the first five or so layers of a single giant spruce.

#### Multiplayer
In multiplayer, this biome is not as good as a regular taiga due to the lack of horizontal cover. However, it provides almost as much wood as a jungle biome and offers a good opportunity for tree bases. There are also mushrooms, which can be used in mushroom soup.

### Savanna
The savanna biome has a similar appearance to the grassland, but it doesn't rain here (except in the windswept variant‌[BE  only]), and it contains plateaus for a greater vertical range of building. Trees are not as abundant as in other forested biomes, with a more open feel. There can be many high mountains, which can be beneficial and problematic. The diversity of views possible offer flat, semi terraced, and sheer vistas.

#### Pros
- Trees are rather abundant.
- Horses can spawn, except in shattered variants.
- Villages can generate here.
	- Villages here generate melons along with wheat in their farms
	- Also, village butchers can have chests that have loot.
- This is the only biome where acacia trees spawn naturally.
- Llamas can spawn.
- Windswept savanna:
	- There is also quite a bit of exposedcoal oreand stone. Also inBedrock Edition, rain can occur in shattered biomes.

#### Cons
- Lack of water makes farms slightly harder to make.
- Grass is thick in this biome. It can hide spiders, camouflage creepers and is hard to get rid of without a bucket.
- Pillager outposts can generate here.
- Terrain in shattered savanna can be dangerous, especially near a cliff as the player can take fatal fall damage and monsters can spawn in the darkness under the cliffs.

#### Useful resources
Acacia and oak trees, horses, llamas for storage, melons and hay bales in villages, tall grass for seeds, an abundance of animals and pillager outposts are useful resources found in the savanna biome.

#### Tips
- Water can be found underground, in villages or in lakes.
- You can set up your main base here, since it has lots of resources like wood, stone, and is still flat.
- Acacia wood, which has a unique orange color and design, is unique to this biome.

#### Multiplayer
Savannas are one of the best places to build bases. They have less trees than a forest, but more than plains. Plateaus are great as vantage points where you can see the surrounding land, and animals and coal spawn here. The only downside to savannas is that once you have gathered the resources, it's just a hotter variant of the plains biome. For this reason, it's important to make a tree farm if the savanna is quite small, so that you can keep producing wood sustainably. Shattered savannas are great for both camouflage and height, but building defenses can be challenging due to the height variation.
