This achievement requires you to hold down the hit/mine button while facing a block of wood until it breaks, then walking over it to pick it up.

Wood blocks are found on trees, which are very easy to find in most biomes, excluding the ocean, desert or badlands biomes.

Logs can also be found in swamp huts, villages, pillager outposts, and woodland mansions.



### Benchmaking

Goal: Construct a crafting table.

Obtain a block of wood and open your inventory. In the four-block crafting space, place the log and pick up the planks from the output slot. Distribute these four planks evenly in the crafting space to make a 2×2 square and pick up the resulting crafting table.

Alternatively, use the recipe book and just click the crafting table to craft it.



### 

Goal: Construct a wooden hoe.

Place the crafting table you just made on the ground, and right-click with your mouse on it, to use it. If you changed the use item/place block key to something else, use that instead.

Then make some sticks, note that this can also be done in your inventory crafting grid:

| Ingredients | Input » Output |
|-------------|----------------|
| Wood Planks | 4              |

Now arrange your sticks and some planks in the crafting table to make a hoe:

|--------------------|----------------|
| Wood Planks+Sticks |                |



### Bake Bread

Goal: Make bread.

Break several blocks of short grass until you gain three wheat seeds. You can do this with one seed but it will take longer.

Then right-click with your hoe on three dirt, podzol, or grass blocks to create farmland, preferably near water, so the seeds get hydrated, and grow faster.

Next, hold the seeds, and right-click on all the farmland blocks. Wait for 1-3 in-game days for the seeds to grow into wheat. Alternately, using bone meal on the seeds will cause it to grow into wheat faster.

After that, break the wheat.

Arrange the wheat like so to craft bread:

| Ingredients | Input » Output |
|-------------|----------------|
| Wheat       |                |

### Cow Tipper

Goal: Pick up leather.

Find a cow, mooshroom, horse, donkey, or llama. Cows can appear at any place with grass blocks and enough light, unless it is an ocean biome. Horses and Donkeys can only spawn in a plains and savanna biome. Red mooshroom only spawn in mushroom fields biome. Llamas only spawn in mountains and savanna biomes. You may have to wander a bit to find one, so make sure you'll be able to find your way back.

Then when you find one, stand next to it and left-click to hit it. You will need to hit it a lot to kill it. They can drop one or two leather (cows along with raw beef). If you did not get any, try the same with another cow, mooshroom, horse, donkey, or llama.

Another way to obtain the achievement is to find and kill some rabbits until you have 4 rabbit hides. Then craft leather and throw it on the ground. When you pick it up, you'll get the achievement.

Another way is by fishing leather if you have luck.



### Repopulation

Goal: Breed two cows with each-other.

Use wheat on 2 cows or 2 mooshrooms to make them breed.



### When Pigs Fly

Goal: Take any amount of fall damage when riding on a pig.

Get a saddle and a carrot on a stick.

Use the saddle on a pig, which should be near a cliff. The easiest way to get it to jump off a cliff is to hold a carrot on a stick in your hand and walk, like you normally would, in the direction of the cliff until you and the pig fall.

Alternatively, you can put the pig on a piston, trapdoor, fence gate, or any kind of opening mechanism. Then ride the pig up there and open the mechanism so you and the pig will take fall damage.



### Monster Hunter

Goal: Kill a hostile mob (monster).

Find a hostile mob. In the Overworld, they can only spawn in darkness, so you should wait until night, or find a dark area like a cave. In the Nether, most can spawn in bright areas. In the End, endermen can only spawn in darkness. You can also find a spawner in a dungeon, mineshaft, stronghold, nether fortress, or woodland mansion and wait for a monster to spawn. Silverfish can be hidden in stone blocks in mountains biomes, and will spawn when the stone is broken.

Then hit it until it dies. With a sword or some tools, this goes faster.
