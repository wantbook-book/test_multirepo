## Farming
### Overworld Farms
In the End, the player can still make many of the farms they would typically make in the Overworld. One of the most important farms to make is a cobblestone generator. Here are two different designs for cobblestone generators that both require 1 lava bucket and 1 water bucket. The first design generates one block at a time, while the second design can generate 4 blocks at the same time, making it far more efficient than the other one.

- Another cobblestone generator but this time generates 4 blocks at a time.

Another important farm to make is a tree farm. To make the trees actually grow, the player must place a torch or some glowstone near the tree, as the natural light level is too low for the tree to grow.

All of the normal farms (like potato farms, sugar canes etc.) work as they do in the Overworld, however they may need to place a light source next to the farm for it to function properly. Nearly all renewable resources of the Overworld can be infinitely renewed in the End, with a few caveats: 

The player must bring the necessary materials and mobs from the Overworld to start. However, once these are in place, the player can make a colony so self-sustaining that it requires no transport to the Overworld for supplies. When enough ender dragons have been killed to open as many gateways as the player is comfortable with, they can start by taking with them some dirt (with optional grass blocks to make the islands more like the Overworld), a few buckets of water and lava, and seeds. Crops and trees can grow normally in the End (unlike the nether, which has fire hazards and no water for the crops) so they do not need anything done differently to care for them, as well as the cobblestone generator. 

Second, once the buildings and infrastructure are in place, the player can transport animals and villagers to the island. Chickens can be brought in the form of eggs and hatched anywhere in the world, but other mobs must be pushed or lured through the end portal. The player is advised to block off the return portal, as this teleports any mobs who fall through it to the player's spawning spot in the Overworld. Provided that the player has brought villagers through the gateway, it is possible to build iron farms in the End, giving the player infinite iron to make weapons and armor to fight the Dragon with once the initial farm is set up on an outer island. 

Building farms on the outer End Islands has several advantages, the biggest being safety from being destroyed by the Ender Dragon. If the player is seeking to colonize the outer End Islands, they must take many difficult steps to get animals and villagers there. Pigs are under a block tall, and can be pushed/lured up a staircase or elevator to the end gateway to be pushed through to the other side. For other mobs such as cows, villagers and sheep, the player must push baby versions of the mobs through the gateway. Building a flying machine out of sticky pistons and slime blocks has several advantages, such as being able to transport adult mobs and able to cover far greater distances than end Gateways. The flying machine travels through the void until it collides with something or is broken en route by the player, and can be built high above the end's tallest structures to avoid collisions. If wanted, a player could take flying machines with villagers and animals millions of blocks away from the center, making for great secret bases on servers.

Since almost everything works the same in the End as it does in the Overworld, the player can then set up the farms they would in the Overworld without great difficulty, once the animals or villagers required for it are in place. (Beds explode if a player tries to sleep in them, but villagers follow a normal day-night cycle in the Nether and End, and sleep in beds without issues, allowing for Iron farms and artificial villages to function normally). Villagers still trade glass, glowstone, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, bottle o' enchanting, bows and arrows, armor, tools, enchanted books, stone variants, block of quartz, and more, and the player can gain the emeralds they need by trading the crops or smooth stone already availiable in the Endâ€”effectively making the End a closed-loop system that eventually needs nothing from the outside world.

### End exclusive farms
One of the advantages of living in the End is that it is far easier to build an enderman farm or grinder. These take a lot of effort to make but are extremely useful after making them. If the player wants to learn how to make one, see enderman farming. Enderman farms are useful, as enderman drop experience as well as ender pearls, which can be used to teleport or crafted into eyes of ender, which are used to make end crystals and ender chests.

Another advantage of living in the End, or at least going to gather chorus fruits, is to make a chorus fruit farm (The player can make it in the Overworld too). Chorus fruits can be used as food, items for making purpur blocks, and its popped variant also make end rod.
