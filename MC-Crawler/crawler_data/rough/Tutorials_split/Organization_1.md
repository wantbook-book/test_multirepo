The setup of how you put items in a specific chest is important too. Putting them randomly is going to make everything a mess, so you can group the same items and blocks together. Create rows of the same thing or section of the chest to specific items. One possible way to do this with multiple tools that have been used before, with differing durability, is to sort them like this: first, sort them by tool, sectioning them off in the chest vertically by pickaxe, shovel, hoe, etc.; then, by what they're made ofâ€“any diamond tools go to the top, while stone or wood goes to the bottom. Within the spaces of the tools, the new ones would be higher up than the used ones. For example, a new iron pickaxe would be higher than the used ones, but still not higher than a used diamond pickaxe. How you sort your items in the chests can save your sanity in the future.

## Inventory
Cleaning up your inventory and hotbar can also benefit players by making unofficial hotkeys. This way, you don't have to look at your hotbar to select what item you want and you can find an acceptable limit for the extra resources you carry. Inventory management is crucial if you want to be an efficient player.

The following are suggestions only. There is no one way to organize an inventory, and if you are overflowing with items, you may need to adjust your item locations.

### Designated inventory slots
This is a method of inventory organization that is capable of changing depending on the task at hand. It uses a general layout with easy access to many items and utilities, but also leaves room for personalization. Some mods may allow you to bind inventory slots to hotkeys.

#### General layout

The screenshot to the right shows the different "zones" in the inventory. You can add these colors to your survival inventory using resource packs.  The color codes are explained below:

| Category           | Items                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

#### Slot switching
The keys used in this suggestion.
There are two ways you can navigate the hotbar: using the mouse wheel to switch between items, and using keyboard keys. The mouse wheel is better for beginners, but it takes longer to scroll to an item and you have a high chance of skipping over the item you want. The keyboard keys can allow to you to switch to any slot on the hotbar from anywhere, but requires you to memorize the keys and you have limited mobility in the split second you switch slots. By default, the number keys are assigned to the corresponding hotbar slot. Some resource packs add numbers to the slots to make it easier.

Here are some different recommended keyboard bindings to use for more advanced players and what fingers might be assigned to them:

| Slot | Key | Finger |
|------|-----|--------|
| 1    | T   | Index  |
| 2    | R   | Index  |
| 3    | G   | Index  |
| 4    | X   | Middle |
| 5    | C   | Index  |
| 6    | V   | Index  |
| 7    | B   | Index  |
| 8    | Z   | Ring   |
| 9    | F   | Index  |

#### Tips and tricks
** Hotkeys **
- Tis for torches.
- Cis for cobblestone (or stone if using silk-touch pickaxe).
- Fis the easiest key to press, so having your sword here is good practice. However, you must change the switch-to-off-hand hotkey.
- You can hover over an item stack in a chest or in your inventory and press a hotkey, and that item swaps with the item currently on the hotbar slot you selected. If nothing is on the hotbar slot, that item moves there.
- You can hover over an empty square in an inventory and press a hotkey, and the item in that hotbar slot jumps to where your mouse pointer is.

** Mouse Wheel **
- The water bucket is in the middle.
- The sword is actually only one slot from the torches and two from the pickaxe.

** Both **
- You should have your sword selected when you're not using any other items.
- Putting things in their places even before you have the items to occupy every space teaches you where to find everything, even early game.
- Having a crafting table and furnace with you at all times lets you be prepared in case your pick breaks while mining or other things of that nature.
