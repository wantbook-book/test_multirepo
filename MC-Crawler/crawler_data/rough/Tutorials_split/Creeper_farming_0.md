# Tutorials/Creeper farming
Creeper farming is one of the most reliable methods of obtaining large amounts of gunpowder. You can either burn them using campfires or kill them with a Looting III sword that multiplies the drop rates significantly.

Charged creeper farming is a variant of creeper farming that produces charged creepers for later detonation to obtain a mob head. As charged creepers are created only when a creeper is struck by lightning, charged creeper farms can be difficult to build. The simplest design is the 'creeper field' design, where creepers are kept in cells below the ground in a flat area.

## Farm designs
### Creeper only farm






























Creeper-only farm
When trapdoors are placed on a 2 block high ceiling, it lowers the height to 1 13⁄16 blocks high. This is tall enough to allow creepers to spawn, but short enough to prevent other mobs such as zombies and skeletons. In Bedrock Edition, this mechanic may not work.[verify] Be aware some Creeper farms can also spawn Spiders. This is easily avoided by removing 3-by-3 areas in the farm. For example, carpet can be placed with 2 blocks between them to block spiders with a minimal loss of spawn area for the creepers.

You can make a creeper farm by placing a spawning platform in an ocean to maximize spawning rates. Make a 2 block wall and the roof has to be trapdoors. Place cats in boats in the end of the farm to scare the creepers away and it directs the creepers to the other end in which you have a water stream guiding the creepers to a Tutorials/Mob Grinder.

Another way to get the creepers to move into a killing zone it to place a snow golem at one end. These snow golems must be at least 3 blocks away from all creepers otherwise the creepers explode, killing the golems. Snow golems are the only creature that players can create that naturally attack creepers.

### Java design



### 
This design requires 2 cats. It's a fairly simple build and despite its small size, it produces around 700 gunpowder per hour, which is enough in the early game. The build layout is in the form of an hourglass, and to make sure only creepers spawn, trapdoors are placed on the roof as creepers are slightly smaller than zombies and skeletons. An AFK platform is built high-up in the sky to increase pack-spawning. To improve the rates further, it is recommended to light up the nearby areas and caves. The farm is also expandable by digging underground. Creepers are killed using campfires or lava but it's recommended to use campfires as gunpowder can be burned in lava.

### 
This design is best used on the cold ocean biome, although it can be used on land, albeit with a bit of spawn proofing to boost the rates. Namiature's design is almost similar to Gnembon's creeper farm, but instead of using a redstone timer to push the creepers away, the creepers are transported to the killing chamber by using cats. Also, instead of using glass pillars, carpets are used to increase the rates further. The creepers are killed by using magma blocks in an X-shaped pattern and the top of the farm is covered with slabs to allow pack spawning. The AFK platform is 127 blocks from the ocean level, with a 21 block bridge made out of glass protruding toward the farm. At the 21st block is where the AFK platform is situated. According to the creator, this is to boost the rates further. The farm itself is fairly expandable, requiring more building blocks, cats, trapdoors, glass and slabs. More layers meant better rates for this farm and is one of the best to build.

SB737 would later modify this design by making a water chamber pushing the creepers toward a nether portal. In the nether, a glass tube is built around the portal, with creepers falling to the killing chamber. SB737 would then kill them after some time, with 5 minutes of AFKing from his 11-layer farm producing over 10 stacks of gunpowder (the Looting III is also applied, amplifying the rates). This is also a good source of XP to mend your equipment.

### Bedrock design



## Charged creeper farms
This farm works with a general mob farm attached to a filter to obtain only the creepers. It then gives each creeper its own 'cell.' The system detects when lightning strikes a cell and then moves the charged creeper into a separate area.

This type of farm is very expensive to build and is not recommended unless you have a lot of time and resources. It is probably better to create a creeper-only farm and use a channeling trident to charge the creepers. The mob filter however may be interesting for platforms that do not have reliable creeper-only farms.

Charged creepers are necessary to obtain mob heads (except for wither skeletons'). Charged creeper farming is one way to create charged creepers. Since the introduction of Channeling tridents, these methods have mostly become obsolete. However, they may still be useful in some editions.

In order for a creeper to become charged, lightning must strike within a 4×4 area of it. Charged creepers despawn just like regular creepers, so it may be prudent to nametag any creepers that you wish to keep for an extended period of time.

### Channeling trident
You can use a trident with the Channeling enchantment to summon lightning during a thunderstorm. Simply create a collection area for a Creeper farm that is small enough that the creepers are within 4 blocks of the lightning strike. Then, wait for a thunderstorm and throw a channeling trident at one of the creepers. Note that the creepers must be exposed to the sky for the Channeling enchantment to work. It is recommended to have the Loyalty enchantment on the trident to allow for easy retrieval.
