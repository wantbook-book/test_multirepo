| Ingredients                | Input » Output |

This is the second most tedious achievement because you will need 164 blocks of gem/metal, or 1,476 gem/metal ingots (around 23 stacks).

- Once you have all of your iron ingots, gold ingots, diamonds, emeralds or netherite ingots make 164 blocks of gem/metal. Then make a square layer of 81 blocks, then a layer of 49, then 25 and then 9. In the middle of the last layer of the pyramid, place a beacon. Make sure there are no opaque blocks above it, as an opaque block above it will deactivate the beacon. Feed it an iron ingot, gold ingot, diamond, emerald, or netherite ingot and choose your primary power and secondary power.
