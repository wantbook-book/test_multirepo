### Operation
After the first 15 minutes of operation, this farm already collected a trident, some gold (copper ingots in 1.17 and later), and a nautilus shell (hard difficulty).
The farm becomes operational as soon as the glass-bottomed pool is filled and you descend to the killing platform. Whack at the drowned legs with your sword (or your fist), and start collecting loot and experience. Fish also spawn in this farm and mostly swim upstream avoiding the fall, but once in a while they fall through and die. This does not affect drowned spawning, but expect to see an occasional raw cod or salmon appear in your chest.

To increase the farm performance, stand on your killing platform and clear all the hostile mobs from the world by temporarily switching the game to peaceful difficulty and then back. Then the only available location where mobs can spawn is your spawning platform. Switching the difficulty to "hard" yields better loot in the collection chest.

### Improvements
The aerial farm described here is slow, although it does produce tridents and nautilus shells. This is the most basic farm, needing only basic materials that are readily available in survival mode.

One reason for the slow yield is due to the mob cap. For example, In Bedrock Edition, only five naturally spawned drowned can exist at any given time. The drowned try to resist the water flow in the spawn platform; therefore they spend much time facing upstream inside the platform before eventually falling through the hole.

To speed things up, the drowned need to face the hole. One way to do accomplish this is to find a turtle egg. Unfortunately, once you find a turtle egg, retrieving it requires a pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch, which may not be available easily in survival. If you can get a turtle egg, your spawning platform should have a 3×3 hole in the center with a block suspended in the middle, connected to the edge of the hole by trapdoors in the open position so that drowned are fooled into thinking they can pathfind to the egg to trample on it. Instead, they fall through the trapdoors. The turtle egg doesn't hatch unless it's on sand. Drowned are not automatically attracted to turtle eggs; they must happen to look in the right direction first, but once a drowned sees it and can find a path to it, the drowned goes for it and falls through the hole.

The best bait is a villager, but in a survival build, it is impractical to transport a villager high in the sky to the spawn platform. Also, if playing an island survival game with few resources, there may not be any villages available to poach. This gets into more exotic farms. The purpose of this tutorial is to teach the basics of drowned farming in survival mode.

To bypass the mob cap and dramatically increase the production rate, you can have the drowned be swept into a Nether portal, so the drowned disappear from the Overworld and drop onto a killing platform in the Nether. This works fine if you are the only player in the world, but if there are other players in the Nether, they need to be within the despawning radius of the killing platform to prevent the drowned from despawning in the Nether.

## Simple variation
There is a simpler, starter design of drowned farms. This build does not involve any redstone and is completely manual. Here are the steps to build and use the farm:

1. Dig a 2×2×4 deep hole in Java Edition (2×2×3 deep in Bedrock Edition).

2. Place a trapdoor at the topmost block (make sure it is on the top half of that block).

3. Fill the remaining blocks with water source blocks (note that in Java Edition, trapdoors cannot be waterlogged, so you will have to build out if you get stuck).

4. The design is complete. After you have built your farm, lure zombies over to the farm. Make sure that the trapdoors are closed in Bedrock Edition so they don't get out of the farm.

Your drowned farm is now complete! You may use it for an easy copper and nautilus shell farm for your survival world.

## Complex variations
The basic flooded-dungeon drowned farm described in this tutorial is quick and simple to construct in survival mode. It isn't automatic, however. It requires your involvement to harvest items from the drowned. While it doesn't yield tridents (and doesn't yield nautilus shells in Java Edition), that farm is still useful for a zombie loot farm to get experience, tools, armor, and weapons with occasional interesting enchantments, as well as other items — without needing to build a deep falling pit or a tall structure in the sky.

Drowned farms on the ocean floor are more complicated because they function similarly to a mob farm, capturing naturally-spawned drowned. First, the drowned should be attracted to one location. Once they are attracted, they need to be funneled into one area where the player can easily kill them. The attracting is often done with villager bait and the funneling is often accomplished with bubble columns.

### Fancier variations
Some farms incorporate innovative ideas such as bubble-column elevators to bring items to surface level, and devices to sort items. The player can circumvent the hostile mob cap (but not the maxEntityCramming gamerule) by pushing the attracted drowned into the Nether dimension. If the Nether dimension is unusable for this purpose, then the bubble columns can transport the drowned up to the player's AFK spot, typically high in the sky.

A river biome converted to an aerial drowned farm (1.17 and lower):




A river biome converted to an aerial drowned farm that takes advantage of terrain generation changes (1.18+):





This river biome farm uses a flying machine to place over a million water blocks quickly. The depicted method of harvesting the drowned from this farm, however, is dangerous in survival as it involves swimming after trident-throwing drowned in a crowd of other drowned.





Basic underwater farm:




Advanced river farm (fastest design):





This design relies on the zombie reinforcement mechanic to allow new zombies to spawn regardless of the mob cap, and converts the zombies into drowned. It does not yield any tridents, but allows for the farming of copper at rates much higher than natural spawning-based drowned farms.




A slightly easier design:
