### Cupboards
All you need is a bookshelf and trapdoor.
Place down a bookshelf (preferably next to a fridge or furnace) and on the side of the bookshelf facing you place a trapdoor and close it. Now it looks like a bunch of boxes of food or colored cups in a cupboard when you open the trapdoor.

You can also do it this way:
You Need:
2 stairs
2 trap doors
Place the 2 stairs inward so it looks like a U. Then place a trapdoor in front of each of the stairs.
Now you have a simple but cute looking cabinet.


The method from RastaPastaWolf:
Use a shulker box in any color. Place on the wall so it opens out toward you. Place a trap door so when closed it covers the box. The boxes can then only be opened when the trap door is open, and you can store items in the boxes. So real cupboards!

You could also put barrels horizontally. This frees up space AND allows you to put stuff like item frames (plates) or sea pickles (cups) for washing on top!

### Stove
** Design 1 **
take two smokers/furnaces and put them side-by-side. Then, in front of each, put any trapdoor (preferably spruce) and close them. Last, put a carpet (aesthetic) or a campfire (functional) on top of both. A campfire functions!

** Design 2 **
Place the furnace at a 2 by 2 arrangement. Crouch down and place iron pressure plates on top of all furnaces.

** Design 3 **
Again two smokers/furnaces side-by-side. then on top, shift place detector rails as burners, for a gas stove. 

## Bathroom
Most nicely built bathrooms have some kind of tiles for the floor. Slabs can help you save time and resources if you're in survival. Quartz looks attractive in bathrooms as they add a clean, polished feel and can be chiseled into different styles. You can even make bathrooms with running water, but these would mainly serve as decorations since you (hopefully) can't actually take a bath or use the toilet. Technically, any small room with an infinite water source and a door, qualifies as a "water closet". However, here are some ways to build fixtures that can be used for disposal and/or decoration. 

### Toilet
Place a hopper then put a trapdoor on it, then you put a lever by the side. Now you have a realistic toilet! Or, take a cauldron, place it, then take an iron trapdoor, put that on top of the cauldron, and then place a button near the trapdoor.

### Shower
You can place slabs on the ground to mark off the edges of the shower. This should usually be built in a corner. Then place a piston in the ceiling or wall and place water behind it. You can use a lever to turn the shower on and off.

Another version is that if you make a wall around 3×3 blocks and put holes in the roof and cover them with glass or trapdoors and then every time it rains if you open them you can have a nice shower.

Another option is to do what it says in the paragraph above this one but don't make holes in the ceiling. This is the easiest and quickest option but you won't have a functional, water-spewing shower. The reason for this option is purely for decoration and you would not be able to use it. 

However, placing a water source above the ceiling (with particles on) will solve the above problem, because the water will make little blue drops (purely for decoration) that fall from the ceiling, making the shower actually "work" in all weathers and without one huge torrent of water that looks pretty unrealistic (have you ever seen a shower that looks like a waterfall?).

Another design involves using a dispenser filled with splash water bottles and a clock circuit to create a more advanced shower which will spray water when turned on. For aesthetic purposes, you can also place a tripwire hook or lever on top of the dispenser's opening.

You can also use a repeating command block with the command "/summon splash_potion shower x, shower y, shower z." You then will need to place a lever on the block adjacent to the command block. Flicking the lever will create a large current of Splash Water Bottles, and the particles produced will create a rain-like effect.

### Bath
** Design 1 **
Use a fence, wall or block and surround a 2×1 area near a wall. Get a dispenser and place it in the wall near a button (or lever if you want it to look more like a tap) and place a water bucket into the dispenser, when you hit the button/lever the water will come out and if you hit again it will clear the water out.

** Design 2 **
Repeat the 1st sentence of Design 1, then fill the space with water, add lever or tripwire hook for a tap. Feel free to change the size of the space where the water is but this size is suitable for an average-sized bathroom.

** Design 3 **
You can simply place a minecart down and sit in it to save time.

Design 4
Dig a 2×2 hole and fill it with water. Surround the water with iron blocks, quartz blocks or white wool.
If in Creative, you can use lingering splash potions for the effect of bath scents.

Design 5 make a border for the bath dig down so it is 2 blocks deep place soul sand on the bottom layer, add water to make a nice bubble bath

You could also combine most of these with a birch boat in the middle to be able to sit in it!
