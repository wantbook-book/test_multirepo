## Locating a monument
Monuments are found only in deep ocean biomes, so you'll need to find an ocean and explore it. Being underwater, the monument may be difficult to see, but the sea lanterns are distinctive and are easily visible if you're looking for them, especially at night. The top of the monument is generally close to the surface, making it possible to search for it in the day, however may be easier to miss. You can also listen for the sound of guardian lasers as they attack squid.

The right seed

- InBedrock Edition,seed templatesincludes a world called "Ocean Monument Ahead", which has a monuments reasonably close to (and visible from) the spawn point.
- InJava Edition, three simple seeds spawn you close to an ocean monument in 1.17: 101 (the closest), 400, and 555555.

These seeds tend to be island survival worlds; it is possible to defeat the nearest monument, but see Tutorials/Island survival for survival tips.

Survival searching

- Using aboat(or aDolphin) is the easiest way of searching for a monument, especially looking for sea lanterns at night.
- Apotion of Night Visionhelps to see the monument from above the water.
- If you have enough,ender pearlscan help travel large stretches of water quickly, but only when thrown above water. You can also use aTridentenchanted withRiptide.
- Use anOcean Explorer Mapfrom the cartographer villager.
- Use anElytrain late game.

Other Methods

- Online tools, such asChunkbasecan be used to locate monuments based on the world seed.
- Using a resource pack with clear water textures makes it easier to see the monument.
- Using the command/locate monument. You can re-create the world from the same seed in creative mode for locating and map-making.
- You can locate a monument by luck if an elder guardian inflicts mining fatigue upon you while you are traveling in a boat.

## Equipment checklist
Equipment that is particularly helpful when infiltrating a monument:

- Aconduitmakes looting the monument much easier to do, as it reduces or eliminates the need for some potions and armor enchantments. Placed appropriately it grants permanent water breathing and better vision throughout the complex, as well as faster mining speeds. If a complete frame is established, this can also attack the guardians. However, the frame requiresprismarineorsea lanterns, which are only otherwise found inocean ruins; excavating them from the monument itself is impractical due to the Mining Fatigue effect.
	- A water plant (e.g.kelporsea grass), waterloggable block, or instantly-breaking block is needed to properly place the conduit while under the effect of Mining Fatigue.
- Atridentmakes the process tremendously easier, especially when it is enchanted withImpalingV andMending; the Impaling enchantment gives the trident a damage bonus against aquatic mobs‌[Java Edition  only]or any mob that is in water‌[Bedrock Edition  only].Loyaltyis also a good enchantment for your trident as it allows you to recover your trident immediately after throwing it, and it also mitigates the risk of losing your trident. Throwing the trident also has the additional benefit of bypassing the thorns effect from guardians as well as ignoring the 30% reduced attack speed, as both penalties only affect melee combat.
	- Lacking a trident, abow, particularly when enchanted withPower, is effective underwater at close range, and can be used easily to kill the elder guardian at the apex of the monument after drying out the "gazebo" area and shooting through a hole in the floor. It also allows the user to bypass the guardians' Thorns effect. Bear in mind that arrows are slowed down significantly while underwater and lose a large portion of their damage when this happens, and as such cannot be fired from medium or long distances.
		- If the damage loss from firing arrows underwater is an issue, consider usingArrows of Harming, however they are hard to obtain onJava Edition, requiring endgamelingering potionsor luck withfletchertrade offers.
	- Acrossbowcan fire arrows like a bow, and the arrows from a crossbow are faster and more damaging than that of a bow. However, underwater there is little difference. Crossbows can also firefirework rockets, which, if crafted withfirework stars, explode upon hitting a mob and do not have their velocity changed by the water, unlike arrows. They require a lot ofgunpowder, however.
- Asword, optionally enchanted withSharpness,Looting, andMendingorUnbreaking, particularly if lacking a trident. Avoid using axes because they are slower (especially with mining fatigue) and lose 2 durability if used to attack a mob.
- Any armor; it is actually possible to defeat a monument without armor, but armor allows you to have helpful enchantments. Wearing aturtle shellinstead of a helmet supplies some additional water breathing. If possible, obtain thesearmor enchantments:
	- Respirationallows you to spend less time worrying about your air supply, which buys you significantly more time should you lack a conduit and run out ofWater Breathing.
	- Aqua Affinityspeeds up mining blocks underwater, which may help with a quick break-in before Mining Fatigue is applied.
	- Depth Striderincreases your movement speed underwater.
	- Protectionreduces damage from the guardians' lasers and thorns. Since the damage is magic and melee oriented, specialized defenses likeProjectile Protectiondo not mitigate the guardians' attacks.
- Foodis essential since you want to regenerate from damage you take. The better the food, the faster you regenerate health.
- Slime blocks,honey blocks,TNTsanddecorated potsare useful for walling off areas you don't want to go to yet, creating barriers to break line-of-sight, and otherwise marking your path, since they can be broken instantly even while affected withMining FatigueIII.
	- If you can't get enough slime blocks, honey blocks, TNTs or decorated pots, you might also try woodendoors,trapdoorsandfence gates, since they can be opened and closed.
		- InJava Edition, doors and fence gates can make an air pocket, which can replenish air in an emergency.
- Potions:
	- Potions of Water Breathingallow you to ignore your air supply and concentrate on hunting the elder guardians and navigating the monument. Not needed if you've set up a conduit.
	- Potions of Invisibility, while wearing onlybootswithDepth StriderIII, let you sneak past the guardians to fight the elder guardians without interruption. Do not wear more than one piece of armor, or the Invisibility does nothing.
	- Potions of Night Visioncan help with seeing in dark areas of the monument. Not needed if you have activated a conduit.
	- Potions of Strengthgreatly increase your melee damage.
- Soul sandis an option to restore air as they emit air bubbles that can be used to replenish air supplies. Their only downside is that they jam you to the ceiling while being used so the best strategy is to use them in safe rooms and make short excursions to clear ahead, then placing another when you feel another safe area has been cleared.
	- Magma blocks also provide air bubbles to replenish air, but forcibly drag you downward to them as you stand in the column. You also take damage if you stand on them without sneaking. You can place a block diagonally above the magma block, and stand on the edge, over the magma to replenish air and not take damage. Magma blocks can also deal some damage to the guardians.
- Golden apples give you 2 extra hearts andRegenerationII for 5 seconds: great when you're coming under heavy fire.
- Milk Bucketmay be useful inJava Editionto remove theMining Fatigueeffect, allowing you to mine through the walls of the monument to reach your destination easier. However, this also negates your beneficial potion effects, and the elder guardians re-apply Mining Fatigue within 60 seconds. Milk is useless inBedrock Editionbecause the elder guardians re-inflict you with Mining Fatigue immediately after you drink the milk.
- ATNTblock and a gravity-affected block such asgravel, as well as a way to light the TNT (preferablyflint and steel). TNT by itself does not destroy blocks underwater. However, if you place a gravity-affected block on top of the TNT before lighting it, the gravity-affected block displaces the water inside the TNT entity, allowing it to blow a hole in the monument.
	- TNT can also be lit right next to an elder guardian, dealing massive damage to it without the player taking thorns damage, while leaving the monument's structure unharmed.

After the elder guardians are dead and the Mining Fatigue has worn off, some additional equipment is helpful for looting the monument:

- If you're planning to collectsea lanterns, a tool withSilk Touchcollects them whole.
- If you do decide to dry out the monument,spongesare extremely useful for that purpose.
	- In that case, you'll also want afurnaceandfuelto be able to reuse them. Or you could also set up aNether portalwith a safe space on the other side, as sponges instantly dry when placed in the Nether.
- Ladders can come in handy for getting up and down within the monument once the water is gone.
