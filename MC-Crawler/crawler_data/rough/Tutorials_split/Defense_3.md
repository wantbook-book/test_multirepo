## Active Defenses
### Materially Inexpensive
#### Overall
If you have a bow or crossbow and arrows, this is a good way to kill mobs (and perhaps players) that get within range is murder holes. Often incorrectly described as "holes in the ground", the actual term is a hole in a ceiling or gateway, in which defenders can fire at enemies. To make one, extend an overhang over your walls to 5-6 blocks outward. Be sure to add battlements. After you've done that, dig a 1-block hole in the floor every little bit, so no bit of ground is uncovered. You can optionally add trapdoors. Make sure to build it off the ground so that creepers cannot blow up while you are looking through a murder hole. This also adds to the overall safety, as you do not have to lean over the walls and subject yourself to skeleton arrow fire when you're sniping a zombie.

If you make a pit with signs and then water on top of it, you can hold space to swim over it, where as mobs will fall.

#### Creepers
A simple way to protect yourself against creepers (or any other 1×1×2 mobs) is a four door trap. Place four doors with left hinges around a pressure plate. Then, place a block above the pressure plate to prevent the mob from jumping free.

Adding a waterfall layer around your wall will stop any explosions from damaging your wall.

#### 
Zombies are well-known of being easy to deal with, and should only cause concern to the inexperienced player or in the presence of other mobs. Zombified Piglins, on the other hand, are peaceful by default and usually only serve as a nuisance within your Overworld base, but could become a problem in your Underworld (or Nether) base.  Zombies can only break down wooden doors, and therefore the best defense against these mobs is always a passive defense. However, protecting your base can be done in multiple other ways which are more effective:

- Placing a column of sand above the door, which will seal the door when it is broken down by a Zombie.

- Placing water next to the bottom of the door. When the door breaks the offending zombie will enter, but other mobs will be slowed down.

- Placing water next to the top of the door and doing the same forlavaon the other side.

- Pistonsandpressure plates.

- You may also place your door 1 block above ground, so zombies cannot destroy it because zombies destroy doors by breaking the top.

#### Skeletons
Since skeletons attack from a distance, the best defense is a good offense. You may need to try and out-range them with a dispenser trap, or simply just bow and arrow to kill from a distance. Skeletons will only chase the player if within 16 blocks, so if you are further than 16 blocks from a skeleton, you should be able to kill it pretty easily with a bow and arrow.

#### Spiders
A clever way to fight spiders is to dig a one wide two deep ditch. Spiders cannot pass through it, but players and another mobs that are 1×2, can. This way, you can simply hit the underbelly of the spider. Spiders also can climb walls, but adding an outcropping or overhang prevents them from getting over since they can't wall-climb on ceilings.

#### Spider Jockeys
Spider jockeys have the dangerous qualities of both skeletons and spiders; they are fast, they can climb walls, and can shoot arrows. Therefore, the best course of action when you are facing one is to kill it off with arrows. Like when fighting skeletons, try to stay at least 16 blocks from the jockey.

#### Slimes
Slimes may spawn above ground during the day. Unfortunately, drowning traps are rather hard to make for slimes, because of the fact that they swim in water instead of sink. However, slimes can be easily defeated using bow and arrow. Due to their melee only attack, they can also be defeated by sword easily. Tiny slimes will not hurt you, though they will push you around. TNT is also very effective against slimes, though it's also quite expensive.

To protect against them if they spawn underground, simply wait and see if any spawn. If they don't, you're fine. If not, try to find where in your mine they are spawning. It's recommended to block off cave systems and noting and cutting off slime chunks, if this happens.

Remember, slimes are also able to spawn in lit up areas.

#### Ghasts
Ghasts cannot see through glass, so if you are in the Nether with some glass, you could make a glass box around yourself to defend yourself. This is helpful because you can see when the danger of a ghast has passed. Building a glass base around your Portal in the Nether is a good idea as you can take in the Nether's epic terrain while being protected from ghasts. This protects both you (whether you're entering the Nether and getting your bearings or leaving the Nether and standing still inside the portal) and the portal, which is deactivated if a fireball explodes within several blocks. Because of this danger, always bring a flint and steel with you. Note that a ghast fireball can also relight an unlit portal, but only if it explodes inside the frame. Ghasts also can't see through sugar cane or vines; however, sugar cane is impossible to plant in the Nether normally, due to the fact that you can't get water into the Nether without using commands (such as /setblock) and sugar cane must be placed next to water. Keep in mind that ghast fireballs have low blast penetration, so many materials are ghast-proof (cobblestone being the best known). Netherrack (which is extremely weak) and transparent blocks, however, are still vulnerable to ghast fireballs. It is traditional (due to Mojang suggesting it to players constantly on the Xbox version) to build a cobblestone room around the nether portal to protect it.
