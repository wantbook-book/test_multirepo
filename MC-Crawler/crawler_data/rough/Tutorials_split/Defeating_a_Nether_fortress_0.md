# Tutorials/Defeating a Nether fortress
Nether fortresses are large structures found in the Nether. Exploring them is essential to game progression, as they are the only places you can find blaze rods and wither skeleton skulls, and one of the two places where nether wart is found. Be careful, however, because these structures are huge and you can easily get lost or killed by powerful mobs.

## Preparation Equipment
### Sword
Your sword (preferably iron, diamond or netherite) is useful for taking out mobs within melee reach, oftentimes wither skeletons, magma cubes, and blazes that haven't flown up. If you have access to enchantments, the most important enchantments will be either Sharpness or Smite. Sharpness adds a slight but noticeable damage increase against all mobs. A case can be made for Smite as well, since it deals far more damage although it can only be used against undead mobs. Most of the mobs you will be fighting in melee anyway are wither skeletons, an undead mob. Unbreaking and Looting are optional but recommended.

### Bow
Your bow is invaluable in the Nether in general, doubly so in a nether fortress. This will be used for taking out high-flying blazes (a common threat) along with ghasts as you roam on bridges.

For enchantments, Power is always useful, along with Unbreaking. Infinity is good although not required, Punch will have little effect since most mobs you shoot at will be far enough away for a slight amount of knockback to have no effect, and Flame has little to no effect except against a few mobs like piglins, hoglins and normal skeletons.

### Arrows
Your bow is useless without arrows. If you haven't picked up some glowstone yet or find some within easy reach, go ahead and mine it because it will be useful for brewing, powerful lighting, and to make spectral arrows.â€Œ[Java Edition  only] Four glowstone dust and an arrow makes two spectral arrows. A spectral arrow, when it hits an entity, makes it glow for a brief time which can help with visibility. If you are low on arrows, using spectral arrows can double your arrow count.

### Armor
You will not survive long in a fortress without armor (what are you doing in the Nether with no armor anyways). Powerful armor is always essential, so netherite is preferred. If you cannot afford them, diamonds will suffice (most of the time). Also, you will want to have at least one piece of gold armor on (preferably helmets as you probably won't need the exclusive enchantments) to ward off piglins attacks. While they don't directly spawn in fortresses, if the fortress is near a nether wastes or crimson forest biome, a pack can come to attack you without provocation while you traverse the exposed bridges. Even if they can't get near you, some are armed with crossbows and will try to shoot at you.

For enchantments, stock up on Fire Protection or Protection. Feather Falling, Thorns, Unbreaking (especially on gold armor) and Mending are useful to prevent unforeseen knock-offs, inflict recoil damage and prevent armor breaking mid-combat, leaving you vulnerable.
