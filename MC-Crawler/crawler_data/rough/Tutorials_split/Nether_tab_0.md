## Nether
Bring Summer Clothes

Requirements: Enter the Nether dimension.

To get this advancement, you will need to enter the Nether. Walk into a nether portal and stand there for 4 seconds: you will appear in the Nether. This is exactly the same as We Need To Go Deeper advancement from the Minecraft tab.

## Return to Sender
Destroy a Ghast with a fireball

Requirements: Kill a ghast with a ghast fireball. Other fireballs do not work.

Ghasts spawn in three Nether biomes: soul sand valley, basalt deltas and nether wastes. When a ghast shoots a fireball at you, wait until it comes close, and then attack the fireball to send it flying back to the ghast. The reflected fireball will roughly go in the direction your crosshair is pointing in, so you can aim at the position where the ghast is about to fly to. 

To reflect the fireball without endangering yourself too much, you should face the fireball, stand slightly to the side, and start spam-clicking the attack button as the fireball comes close. The fireball can be attacked slightly outside its hitbox, so even if you fail to hit the fireball, it flies past you without dealing damage. The spam-clicking is beneficial because the time window to hit the fireball is very short, and the fireball can be reflected regardless of attack cooldown.

The above method is, however, very dangerous for unskilled players. A safer method is to shoot a projectile, such as an arrow or a snowball, at the fireball. When hit with a projectile, the fireball moves in the direction that the player is facing, and this can be used to more accurately aim the projectile at the ghast.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 50 experience, as it is a challenge advancement.

## Those Were the Days
Enter a Bastion Remnant

Requirements: Go inside a bastion remnant.

Bastion remnants are hard to miss, since they are enormous structures made of blackstone (and all of its variants). Bastion remnants spawn in every biome in the Nether except for the basalt deltas. When you enter any type of a bastion, you will be rewarded the advancement.

Note that bastions are quite dangerous places to be in: for tips on how to conquer them, see this tutorial.

## Hidden in the Depths
Obtain Ancient Debris

Requirements: Have ancient debris in your inventory.

Ancient debris can be found exclusively in the Nether. It generates as a block at levels 8 to 119, but mainly at levels 8 to 22. On average, level 16 has the most ancient debris. To mine it, you need a diamond pickaxe or better. Ancient debris can be also rarely found in chests in bastion remnants. Once you have the ancient debris in your inventory, you will be rewarded the advancement.

For a specific tutorial on how to find ancient debris, see "Tutorials/Ancient Debris".

## Subspace Bubble
Use the Nether to travel 7Â km in the Overworld

Requirements: Travel at least 875 blocks horizontally from your original nether portal in the Nether, and then create and enter another nether portal in that location.

Use the Nether to travel between two points in the Overworld with a minimum horizontal distance of 7000 blocks between each other. Horizontal distances are scaled down in the Nether by a ratio of 8:1. This essentially means that for every one block you travel in the Nether, you travel eight blocks in the Overworld. This also means that you must travel at least 875 blocks in the Nether in order to travel 7000 blocks in the Overworld.

The distance is measured as Euclidean. For example, traveling from coordinates 0,0 to coordinates 600,600 in the Nether and building a nether portal to the Overworld there is not enough, but traveling from 0,0 to 700,700 is enough, as that translates to 700 * 8 * sqrt(2) blocks in the Overworld, which is roughly 7920.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 100 experience.

## A Terrible Fortress
Break your way into a Nether Fortress

Requirements: Enter a nether fortress.

Nether fortresses spawn in all Nether biomes: look for a large, dark brown structure with many rooms, hallways and pillars, made of nether bricks. Sometimes one may have to travel a long way in the Nether in order to find a fortress.

For tips on finding a nether fortress, see this part of the tutorial on defeating a nether fortress.

## 
Obtain Crying Obsidian

Requirements: Have crying obsidian in your inventory.

Crying obsidian can be obtained from bartering, from finding it as part of ruined portals, or from loot chests in bastion remnants. You will need a diamond pickaxe or better to mine it, if you found it as a block.

Once you have the crying obsidian in your inventory, you will be rewarded the advancement.
