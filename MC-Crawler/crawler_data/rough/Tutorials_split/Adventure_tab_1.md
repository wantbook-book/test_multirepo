Successfully trade with a Villager

Requirements: Trade with a villager or a wandering trader.

First, you need to find a villager or a wandering trader. Villagers naturally spawn in villages (except abandoned villages). If you can't find any village or if you are in a world where villages don't generate, alternatively you can cure a zombie villager (see the advancement Zombie Doctor in Minecraft tab, or paragraph about curing). Wandering traders spawn randomly near the player, once in every few days. 

Use the villager or wandering trader to see their trades. Depending on villager's profession, their GUI will look slightly different.

Next, you need to gather the item that villager/trader wants in a sufficient amount. Item wanted is shown on the left side of the trade, and item gives is shown on the right. If they want emeralds and you don't have any yet, you should probably switch to a different villager; you can also loot chests in the village if you find any, these have a chance to generate emeralds.

When you gathered items for the trade, put it in their trading slot. Then, pick up the item that they give you in return. This will grant you the advancement.

## Crafting a New Look
Craft a trimmed armor at a Smithing Table

Requirements: Trim a piece of armor at a smithing table using an armor trim smithing template.

First, you need a smithing template. It can only be found in rare generated structures, and a complete list can be found here; any armor trim template works for this advancement, but the netherite upgrade does not. Probably the easiest smithing template to find is coast armor trim, found relatively often in shipwrecks.

If you have only one trim, it is strongly recommended to duplicate the smithing template using seven diamonds and a corresponding material before trimming the armor, so you can apply this template to other armor pieces later, as the smithing template is consumed each time you trim an armor using it.

Next, you need a smithing table:

| Ingredients               | Crafting recipe |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Iron Ingot+<br/>AnyPlanks |                 |

Smithing tables can also naturally generate in villages and trail ruins.

Put your template, a piece of armor and a trimming material in proper slots.

| Ingredients                                        | Smithing recipe |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Any Armor Trim +Any Armor Piece +Any trim material | Upgrade Gear    |

Pulling the trimmed piece out of the smithing table will grant you the advancement.

## Sticky Situation
Jump against a Honey Block to slow down your fall

Requirements: Jump into the side of a honey block so that it slows you down as you fall.

Craft a honey block from four honey bottles to (more info on how get those under Bee Our Guest advancement in Husbandry tab).

| Ingredients  | Crafting recipe |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Honey Bottle |                 |

You need for the honey block to "slow down your fall". Touching any side of this block while falling slows you down, but the game tracks this in a slightly unpredictable way, so multiple attempts may be required. A recommended way of obtaining this advancement is like so: place the honey block one block above the ground, all spaces around it should be empty. Stand right next to the honey block, so that your hitbox collides with it, and jump. Try a couple of times if this didn't trigger the advancement, you should eventually get it.

## 
Shoot a crossbow

Requirements: Load (fire up) a crossbow, then shoot with it.

Crossbows can be obtained in a few ways. You can craft a crossbow like so:

| Ingredients                                          | Crafting recipe |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Stick+<br/>Iron Ingot+<br/>String+<br/>Tripwire Hook |                 |

Crossbows can also drop from pillager and piglin, be bought from fletcher villagers, and found in chests in bastions and pillager outposts.

Besides the crossbow, you need at least one arrow in your inventory. Select the crossbow and hold use to load it. Release and press use again to fire it, and you will get this advancement. You don't need to hit anything with the shot arrow.

## Surge Protector
Protect a villager from an undesired shock without starting a fire

Requirements: Be within 30 blocks of a lightning strike that doesn't set any blocks on fire, while an unharmed villager is within or up to six blocks above a 30×30×30 volume centered on the lightning strike.

First, you need to find a villager (see What a Deal! above or "villager" page for more info). You should also get a lightning rod, which is crafted like so:

| Ingredients  | Crafting recipe |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Copper Ingot |                 |

A trident enchanted with Channeling is not necessary, but will be helpful (see A Throwaway Joke below for more info). 

In the setup, distance is crucial: the lightning rod needs to be far enough from the villager to not convert it into a witch, and close enough so that this advancement is triggered. The player also needs to be close to the lightning rod. To make the lightning not set any blocks on fire, the best option is to build a small pillar out of non-flammable blocks at least 4 blocks high, and put the lightning rod on top of it. Make sure the lightning rod has access to the sky. A simple setup can look like this: rod on top of a 4-high pillar, 6 empty spaces between the trapped villager and the pillar.

An exemplary setup
When this is done, you have to wait for a thunderstorm. Note that they are quite a rare event and can last for a very brief amount of time. When the thunder starts, any lightning that would strike in the area protected by the lightning rod (a sphere of 128 blocks) will divert into the rod instead. However, it is not certain that during a thunderstorm there will be such a lightning. If you want to guarantee getting this advancement on your first thunderstorm, prepare a trident with Channeling, and throw it at the rod as soon as a storm starts.

Once the lightning strikes the lightning rod, all players within a 30 block radius of the rod are granted the advancement.

This is one of only two advancements in the game that requires a thunderstorm: for the other one, see Very Very Frightening below.
