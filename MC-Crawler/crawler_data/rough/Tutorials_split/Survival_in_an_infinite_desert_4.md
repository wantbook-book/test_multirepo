### The gory details
Thankfully, Minecraft does not consider the need of human beings for water (perhaps all the cactus takes care of hydration). However, from Day 3, if you have not yet found a village, or earlier if you have been injured (from falling or fighting mobs), you need food. There are few options in the nake desert as most passive mobs, such as pigs and cows, cannot spawn except at villages. While sugar cane can grow in the desert (if there is water), sugar is not edible in Minecraft. You can make pumpkin pie and cake with sugar, but this requires many other ingredients that are difficult or impossible to acquire in the desert. 

So, in a desert, outside of a village, the only living food sources are rabbits or salmon, and you probably have to eat them raw, which is not nutritious. A campfire becomes a valuable tool for cooking, making meat-based foods more effective.

First of all, let's look at the food you can obtain without finding a village farm.

### Rabbits
Rabbits can sometimes be difficult to catch. Early in a desert survival game, you'll only be able to hit them with your bare hands, but if you are persistent you can eventually kill them. If you are lucky enough to be near water, chase them into water. They lose their speed advantage in water and you catch them more easily. Of course, the loot drops into the water, so be prepared to swim after them. Also, don't get lost chasing rabbits and lose your way back to your shelter. That can be fatal.

In addition to rabbits dropping raw rabbit, they also drop rabbit hide, which can be used to make leather. However, leather is not much use without a full-sized crafting table. 

If you are lucky enough to have any grass blocks or buy podzol from a wandering trader, you may be able to get flowers. With flowers, you can attract and breed rabbits. This then turns them into a renewable food source. Otherwise, you may have to keep wandering around the desert to find more rabbits after you have killed off all the rabbits in an area. If there are no flowers nearby, kill skeletons for their bones, because you can craft bone meal and use that to fertilize grass blocks to grow additional flowers. As long as skeletons keep coming, you can create a permanently sustainable food supply this way. Alternatively, if you are able to mine fossils, you can craft bone meal from those, but that is difficult without at least stone tools (bone meal can be obtained from various ways in villages, but villages can solve your food problems in easier ways).

So your renewable sustainable food chain (without a village farm) looks like this:

skeletons or fossils --> bone --> craft bone meal --> spread on grass blocks --> new flowers --> breed new rabbits --> rabbit meat (probably raw, see below)

When breeding rabbits, note that they are stupid and often kill themselves in falls (in fact, they follow flowers to their deaths, if you just want to slaughter them without having to chase them). Keeping them alive for farming can be challenging. They need at least a 3 high wall (or a 3 deep trench) to keep them from jumping out. Make sure your bunny enclosure doesn't give them the opportunity to fall. However, be careful roofing over your bunny enclosure, you don't want it to spawn monsters. If you can find water, an enclosure with water near the edges might keep them from suicide. The ideal enclosure is probably a three deep trench or pit (so they can't jump out), flooded with water (so they don't die falling in), only one block deep (so they don't drown). Or alternatively, a natural lake surrounded by a wall that lets the rabbits in but not out.

Rabbits are also present in Superflat Desert Preset worlds, but they seem much less common.

### Salmon
If you’re lucky enough to find a river, you might be able to tap into a new food source. Until then you must rely on rabbits or village food. Besides fishing, salmon can be acquired in buffet worlds through river biomes. They are easier to catch than rabbits and can easily be trapped in sections of rivers. Expanding river areas can allow increased salmon spawns. They’re less nutritious than rabbit but more likely spawn in groups. They also drop bonemeal, for farming seeds or flowers. However Drowned can be a real threat if they carry tridents. Besides the threat of drowned, building your home in the middle of a natural lake or river biome would be safe. It would allow you to access food easily from the water. And at night , the water would protect against creeper explosions, and if two blocks deep zombies, husks, and skeletons.



### Seeds
If you have any grass blocks, and more dirt, use the dirt to 'grow' more grass blocks, use bone meal to grow tall grass, harvest lots of tall grass and eventually you might get some wheat seeds. Seeds can also be obtained from Wandering Traders or from village farms. However, make sure to remember that you can only grow the seeds in a village farm that has already been turned into farmland, because you can't make a hoe so you can't convert dirt to farmland. And unless you get a crafting table, also from a village, you can't even turn wheat into bread. Without a village, probably the best use for seeds is to save them until you have managed to obtain two chickens from the incredibly rare husk chicken jockeys. You could then use the seeds to attract and breed the chickens.
