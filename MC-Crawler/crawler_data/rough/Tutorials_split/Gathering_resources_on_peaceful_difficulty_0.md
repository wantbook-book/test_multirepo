# Tutorials/Gathering resources on Peaceful difficulty
This tutorial is about how to gather resources that are usually dropped from either hostile or neutral mobs. 

Because most hostile or neutral mobs do not spawn in Peaceful, sometimes it is hard to gather these resources. Also, this page may be helpful when playing any Survival world, if you do not like to fight monsters, but want to get the items that they drop. Another use of this page would be if you want to play Minecraft without any data packs, as this will disable mob drops. However, it will also disable loot in chests, so trading with villagers is one of the few ways you can acquire these items.

## Achievable In Peaceful
These materials are usually mob drops, but can be achieved by other means when a world is on Peaceful difficulty.

### Bones
Bones are commonly dropped from skeletons. Being hostile, however, skeletons cannot spawn in Peaceful. Still, there are other methods of achieving bones.

Bones can be found naturally occurring in the chests of desert temples, jungle temples, dungeons, ancient cities, and woodland mansions. Unless you happen to have a jungle near your spawnpoint, or if you're very lucky a dark forest with a woodland mansion in it, your best bet would be to find a desert or a dungeon. It's best to find a dungeon in caves, but if you don't have many caves nearby, you can just mine underground. Unfortunately, monster spawners can't spawn mobs on Peaceful difficulty, so in Peaceful, you can't listen to the sounds of zombies, skeletons, or spiders to find dungeons. To find a desert temple, you will need to find a desert first, and then explore around the desert. The advantage of desert temples is they can be seen from a long way away. However, when finding structures with chests that could potentially hold bones, remember that a desert temple chest does not always have a bone in it.

There are 2 more ways to find bones. One of them is through fishing. If you fish with a fishing rod without a Luck of the Sea enchantment, you will have a 1.1% chance of getting a bone. However, the disadvantages of this method are that a fishing rod requires string, which is most commonly obtained from spiders, which don't spawn in Peaceful, and that you will only have a small chance of getting a bone when fishing. 

In Bedrock Edition, all fish mobs have a 25% chance of dropping 1–2 bone. As at least one fish variety can spawn in every single type of ocean, and salmon spawn in rivers as well. This actually makes bones quite easy to obtain.

### Bone Meal
A common way to obtain bone meal is by crafting it from bones, but there are several ways to obtain it without using bones.

The first method is by finding fossils, which contain bone blocks. This will be useful if you need a massive amount of bone meal. The advantage of this method is that 1 bone block = 9 bone meal, and fossils usually have many bone blocks within them. However, fossils are rare, and only generate in deserts and swamp biomes. The best way to find bone blocks is to first find a swamp or desert, and then either find caves, or ravines, or try using this method. Remember, fossils generate around 15–24 blocks under surface (around altitude 40–49), so if you are on desert hills or swamp hills, fossils generate higher. Another way to find a massive amount of bone blocks in 1.16 and above is to find a soul sand valley where small fossils generate very commonly, and due to being in peaceful mode, you will not need to worry about the ghasts and skeletons.

In Bedrock Edition, you can buy 3 bone meal for one emerald from the wandering trader, but wandering traders do not always offer bone meal.

In Java Edition, all 4 types of fish mob have a 5% chance to drop bone meal. Salmon is especially convenient because it can be found in rivers, and rivers are one of the most common biomes in the game, so you don't need to go to the ocean.

The easiest way to get bone meal is by using a composter, usually using items from a farm. For example, if you have too much cactus from a cactus farm, or  excess seeds from a wheat farm, just put them into the composter and you will get bone meal after composting it several times. This is the best way to get bone meal without traveling to the nether, as you just need a composter to transform plant-related items or blocks into bone meal. Although not very efficiently, the composter can be used in conjunction with roses dropped from iron golems to automatically create bonemeal from an iron farm.
