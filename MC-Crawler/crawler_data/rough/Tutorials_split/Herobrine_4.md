## Lost media
A screenshot posted by Copeland in his forum thread, showing the room where Herobrine appeared.
No known archive exists of the earliest 4chan thread containing the original Herobrine story, and it is not known where the earliest known image of the creepypasta originated.

The original Herobrine livestream was located here[81] and the second Herobrine livestream was located here.[82] Both livestreams were deleted at some point during the following months, and no known backups are available. Copeland, the Brocraft founder, and Livestream.com have all stated that they do not have a backup copy of these streams.

The earliest known Herobrine plugin was located here.[83] This was also deleted at some point during the following months, and no known backups of any of the original versions of the plugin are available either.

Any users who may have captured, recorded, or downloaded these media for personal use are encouraged to share them for future generations of Minecraft fans.

### Stream recreation

## Similar characters
Due to Herobrine's popularity, other stories regarding similar entities have since appeared.

The most popular example is "Entity 303", who supposedly behaves much like the common interpretation of Herobrine as being hostile, griefing builds and crashing players' games.[84] According to the legend, he is a hacker who planned to destroy Minecraft by 2014 or 2015.[85] Notch has acknowledged Entity 303, telling players to "go read a science, people! there are no ghosts!"[86] Interestingly, this dismissal by Mojang and Notch has been incorporated into the creepypasta in order to increase the sense of urgency.[85]

Another example is "Null", who according to the story, behaves a lot like Herobrine, passively modifying the world, but seems to be slightly more active than Herobrine, and appears to have Herobrine under some kind of threat.[87] He seems to appear based on upgrading and downgrading versions. Both of these stories claim Herobrine is benevolent,[87][88] which is an expansion on his original passive nature and a subversion of his commonly described hostile nature.
