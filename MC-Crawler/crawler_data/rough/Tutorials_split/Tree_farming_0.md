# Tutorials/Tree farming
Tree farming is the process of planting a large number of saplings and waiting for them to grow into trees. These trees are then harvested for wood and more saplings, which can be used to grow another generation of trees. This can be repeated indefinitely, yielding a regular supply of logs without the hassle of covering large areas of terrain, therefore making wood a renewable resource. A secondary benefit of tree farming is that it allows conservation of the surrounding environment. The use of bone meal can speed up the process, or players can just plant the saplings and go do something else while they grow.

For detailed information on the mechanics of tree growth and structure, see the article on trees.

## Uses
Tree harvesting is an essential first step for any player in Survival mode. The wooden blocks can be harvested for wood, without requiring tools, although an axe quickens harvesting. Each wood can be crafted into planks and sticks, which are used to craft tools, like a wooden pickaxe and similar wood-derived materials.

Wood can also be smelted into charcoal, a functional, easily renewable substitute to coal.

When leaves are harvested, or decay naturally, they have a chance to drop a sapling of their own species, which can be planted to grow a new tree. Decaying oak and dark oak tree leaves also have a 1/200 chance of dropping an apple.

Destroying leaves does not require a tool; a sword is negligibly faster than bare hands but wears out the sword. Using a hoe increases the speed of breaking leaves, with an iron hoe able to mine them instantly. Using shears harvests usable leaf blocks for the player to pick up and later place elsewhere. Use of fire also destroys leaves quickly, but when used on a tree, fire also destroys much of the wood. Also, any leaf block unconnected or too far from a block of wood decays naturally over time.

Wood is also one of the most used building blocks in the game, used as pillars, flooring or simply as the main building material for base building.

Aside being used as a building material, wood is also essential in crafting. Chests, hoppers, tools, fences, torches, etc. have wood as one of its materials and are thus really important.

## 
Because all eight types have different advantages and disadvantages, the best tree to choose can vary with the situation: 

### Harvesting
- Oakis plentiful and convenient in compact spaces, making it the best at the beginning of the game. Oak leaves can also drop apples.
- Birchgrows quickly and has the most uniform height, and is ideal for automatic farming, making it the best in moderately sized fields.
- Dark Oakgrows extremely quick, has a larger average yield than oak, and is considerably more compact and safer to harvest than jungle giants. Dark oak leaves can also drop apples. Difficult to farm automatically.
- Junglesize and its tendency to spawn branches is ideal for mass-production of raw wood yield per tree, making it the best late game tree if provided plenty of time and space. The giant variant is difficult to farm automatically, however the smaller version is considerably easier to automatically farm.
- Acaciais ideal for space-efficient farming. Also difficult to farm automatically, however the amount of logs per tree almost makes it viable.
- Spruceis easy to find, but is too tall for convenient harvesting, and is not especially convenient to farm. The giant variant is good for time-efficient wood-quantity especially when a spiral technique is applied to harvest it. The giant variant is difficult to automate, however, with a fast enough layout it is well worth it.
- Huge fungusis only found in the nether and require anyliumblock to grow on. They are space-efficient, however. They grow only when bone meal is used. The near nonexistent growth restrictions allow great freedom for automated farming. And much like the giant spruce trees, if you have a fast enough layout it is well worth it. Plus they also grow other useful blocks, such asshroomlightsandweeping vines.
- Azaleatrees  can be farmed for azalea and flowering azalea leaves. They also yield oak wood without the chance of growing a difficult to remove large oak tree. Azalea trees can also be fully automatically farmed without any player input using moss farms.
- Mangroveis a rare tree, but they can be planted underwater and they createmangrove roots, which can be used as extra fuel.Bone mealingthe leaves also produces a guaranteed propagule.
- Cherryis also rare, and their logs grow very unpredictably, but cherry wood has a very unique texture. Huge number of Saplings will drop from every tree.
- Bamboocan also be made into wood. While it takes a lot of bamboo to make planks, it is easily farmable. Seethis pagefor more details.

### Wood texture
Different kinds of trees have different wood textures. If building wooden structures, you may choose a specific type of wood for its texture. Because the efficiency difference among tree types is only slight, appearance often has priority. If building or decorating with multiple wood types, having a tree farm for each is also useful.
