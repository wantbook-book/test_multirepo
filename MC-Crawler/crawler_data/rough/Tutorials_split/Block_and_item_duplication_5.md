When using this method there might be a chance the items will get deleted, so creating a backup is recommended.
This method will not work on Realms. 

1. Gather all the items you want to duplicate as well as a chest.

2. Place your chest, and make sure there is 4 dirt in front of the chest.

3. Save & Quit, and then rejoin the World. 

4. Place the items you want to duplicate in the chest and quickly break 4 dirt in front of the chest 1 y-level below it in a 2Ã—2 square shape then count to 4.

5. Quickly forcibly close the application. 

6. Rejoin the game. One of three things will have happened; 
A) The items will have duplicated (both in inventory and chest), 
B) The items will have been removed (neither in inventory nor chest), 
C) Nothing will have happened (in chest or inventory).

#### Chunk save stating
This method works by causing the game to crash in a way that only the chunk you are standing in will not save correctly, this will cause the chunk you are standing in to revert to the last save, allowing you to dupe in that chunk.

### Patched
To use the following methods, you will have to either not update past that point or revert to a previous update (if possible for your system, not all can, such as on Xbox One or Nintendo Switch).

This can be used to duplicate any 2 block tall flower.

Steps:

1: Get an item with Fortune (level 3 works best) and a 2 block tall flower.

2: Place the 2 block tall flower.

3: Break said flower.

The flowers should have at least duplicated. I think you can get up to 6!

Duplicates all gravity-affected block except dragon eggs

This video will explain how to duplicate any gravity-affected block. It works similarly to gravity block duplicators in Java Edition: by having a falling block enter an end portal and become a block on the same tick. 




The reason this design does not work for dragon eggs is that it relies on pistons being able to push blocks into their original position. This allows for the block to be duplicated repeatedly, every 6 redstone ticks. However, one can manually duplicate dragon eggs with a similar process:

| G | D |  |  |  |
|---|---|--|--|--|
| P |   |  |  |  |
|   |   |  |  |  |

In the above diagram, the G, D, and P denotes the grindstone, dragon egg, and portal, respectively. The repeater is necessary for the timing to work correctly, due to MCPE-15793. Like the automatic gravity block duplicator, one must use huge mushrooms to replace the End portal frames.

To use, deactivate the lever, and a second dragon egg will appear in The End. You can then re-activate the lever to break the dragon egg and place another one. This design can be used for other gravity blocks, but the automatic version is generally more efficient.

Another alternative to end portal based duping is end gateway based duping, however, it is not as fast as end portal based duping.

You will need two book & quill and an anvil. Write any text in one book & quill, and sign it. From then, copy the first book & quill by placing them next to each other in the crafting grid. Take the item you wish to duplicate and rename it to the name of the copied book. From here, you can shift-click the anvil result and duplicate your item.

#### 
When naming a stack of items in an anvil, you can use the "Take Half" option to receive the output items without depleting the original stack. As long as you do not take the final renamed item, you can go to the original stack and pick it up to start more or just leave the anvil interface if you are done.

- A way to speed this up is to hit "Take Half", then "Toss Item" while standing close to the anvil, so you can rapidly go through a full stack without having to manually move each selection.

Items duplicated this way won't work for quick use in a recipe, though certainly can be used for Classic crafting and any other use. However, if you wish to revert an item to the default name, you can do so by crafting it into another item then crafting it back to the original (such as redstone block -> redstone dust x9 -> redstone block), or by placing it as a block then breaking it back into an item.

- Sometimes a block won't lose its name when broken into anitem, such asshulker boxeswhich are meant to keep their name, or just randomly the name may stay with a regular block and repeating the process will remove the name. However, some items may break into different items, such as anender chestdroppingobsidian, and the obsidian will each retain the ender chest's name (this was likely a glitch).
- TNT Duplication
- 1. Put a TNT anywhere
- 2.Put a chest aside the TNT
- 3.Put the item that you want to duplicate in the chest
- 3.Light the TNT and at the same time the TNT explodes take out the item in the chest(this requires correct timing and good armor if you want to stay alive after the explosion)

1. Get a donkey

2. Get a Looting 3 sword

3. Put a chest on the donkey

4. Put your items in that chest 

5. Kill the donkey

The Looting 3 sword causes the donkey to drop more items than normal.
