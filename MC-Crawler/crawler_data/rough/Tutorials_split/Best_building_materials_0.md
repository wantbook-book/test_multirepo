# Tutorials/Best building materials
When building houses or other structures, it's important to choose the right materials for construction. Using lots of flammable or non blast resistant blocks may make it easy for your house to be destroyed. You may spend unnecessary time looking for supplies to build a house out of rare materials. If no consideration is taken to building materials, the end result can end up looking strange at best and unappealing/haphazard at worst. This tutorial page contrasts different building materials and gives an overall view of the quality of the material.

## What to look for
When picking a material to build with, there are three main considerations: obtainability, durability, and decoration.

### Obtainability
Some materials are easier to get, while others are extremely difficult and many are somewhere in between. For example, in Survival, making a house of cobblestone is certainly easier than making one of diamond blocks. Also to consider is the renewability of the material you would like to use. Some materials can be replicated through various means and thus gained infinitely, while others must be sought after over increasing distances from spawn.

### Durability
The durability of a material is important, especially in PVP. The biggest factors are hardness, blast resistance, and flammability. However, maximum durability is not always necessary. If you don't expect to be attacked by players, then hardness shouldn't be a problem. If you can stop creepers from getting close, blast resistance isn't as important. If there is no nearby lava or trees to spread fire and you aren't concerned about lightning, flammability isn't a problem either. Just remember that it is usually better to have too much durability than too little.

### Decoration
See also: Tutorials/Adding beauty to constructions

Unless you are building strictly for function, decoration blocks are a big part of enhancing your builds when you've done all that you feel you can with normal building blocks. Ultimately, what looks the best is a matter of opinion, and there is no right or wrong way to decorate.

However, it out best to use gradients on your build. For a stone wall, rather than just using stone bricks, try to use a variety of blocks on your desired colour to create a mod varied, textured, wall. 

Another useful tip when creating your textures is to put the lighter colours higher up, to draw to the eyes to the top.

| Dirt         | Dirt is very weak and isn't the most beautiful material to build with either. However, it is found on the surface of nearly all biomes and can be mined up very quickly, even with a player's hand, meaning that it is suitable for beginners on their first night but is easier to make a hole in the ground. It is generally not a good idea to use dirt as part of a permanent structure, unless you are explicitly aiming for an "earthen" look, complete withgrass blocksfor extra decor. Alternatively, dirt can be used to "camouflage" a structure made from other materials, either to make it blend in more with the surroundings or make it look less valuable than it actually is. | Very common and easy to obtain.<br/>Not flammable.<br/>Renewable via crafting and then tilling coarse dirt, or by trading with a wandering trader.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Low blast resistance of only 0.5.<br/>Easily broken by hand.<br/>Turns into grass blocks if exposed to sunlight (unless converted into coarse dirt), which may not be desirable.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |  |

| Stone Bricks | Stone bricks grant a very medieval and in some ways, militaristic feel to structures made out of it and is in many ways the ideal building material for structures meant to look medieval, militaristic and/or fortified in general, like forts and castles. Stone Bricks are style-wise fitting for structures meant to hearken back to the High and Late Middle Ages and later (Compare with cobblestone, which looks more fitting for structures aiming look in line with the Early Middle Ages).                                                                                                                                                                                           | Obtained by crafting it from Stone (which in turn is obtained by smelting cobblestone), making it renewable.<br/>Has a good blast resistance of 6.<br/>Not flammable.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Is somewhat expensive and time-consuming to acquire, as every batch of 4 blocks of Stone Bricks requires 4 blocks of Stone which must be smelted from cobblestone.

| Bricks       | Bricks have a very pleasant look to them and a high blast resistance. However, they are also rather expensive, even though they are renewable. They are good for buildings with a neutral yet pleasant look, looking similar to stone bricks but without the belligerent feel. Bricks also convey and express an image of sturdiness more readily than blocks likeconcrete.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Has a high blast resistance of 6.<br/>Has a detailed and polished look, but not a wild look, making it great for many styles of buildings.<br/>Renewable via trading with mason villagers.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Costs 4 clay balls per block, and they must be smelted, or bought from masons, making it expensive.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |  |
| Obsidian     | Obsidian is an extremely strong material and takes a long time to break. Its breaking time can be a pain when building but is great for protection against other players on multiplayer PVP servers but some players may not like the look.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Invincible to vanilla explosions with a blast resistance of 1,200.<br/>Very hard to mine through, even with proper tools.<br/>Renewable via bartering.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Difficult to collect and build with due to the long breaking time.<br/>Cannot be moved by pistons.

| Sand         | Sand is a gravity-affected block that can be found in manyOverworldbiomes. Sand is generated in large numbers in thedesert. it might be good for walls but not roofs. It can also be layed out and used to pave over a surface to import a small slice of the desert to an environment. Red sand on the other hand, is identical to normal sand, save for its reddish color. This reddish color makes it somewhat resemble Mars dust, so it can be employed to create an environment with a "Martian" feel. Compare withend stone, which somewhat resembles stereotypical Moon rock.                                                                                                           | Easy to obtain.<br/>Not flammable.<br/>Renewable via trading with a wandering trader.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Affected by gravity.<br/>Blast resistance of 0.5.<br/>Can be easily destroyed by hand.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |  |
| Sandstone    | Sandstone looks great for certain style of homes, especially a desert-style home or if one wishes to emulate Ancient Egyptian architecture. It's strongly recommended to have a desert biome nearby if you want to make a building out of sandstone. It has a low blast resistance, however. Red sandstone, a variant for normal sandstone, behaves identically, but has a reddish color, making for a similar style to red sand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Fairly easy to decorate with and has several variants for different textures.<br/>Easily found and mined in the desert biome.<br/>Renewable via the sand purchased from wandering traders.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Has a low blast resistance of only 0.8.<br/>Easily mined through.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |  |
| Terracotta   | Terracotta is a rather colorful block, making it good for some styles of homes. It also has a high blast resistance. However, it is rather time-consuming and expensive to acquire unless the player has access to abadlandsbiome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Comes in many different colors, providing many variations for decoration.<br/>Has a decent blast resistance of 4.2.<br/>Not flammable.<br/>Colorless terracotta is renewable from being made by smelting clay, which can be made with renewable clay balls gifted from masons after raids‌[Java Edition  only] or mud convert to clay block, while colored is renewable by trading with masons.<br/> | Is expensive and time-consuming to acquire, as it requires lots of clay, smelting, and dyes, or access to a badlands biome.<br/>Has no stairs or slab versions<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |  |
| Concrete     | Similar to terracotta, Concrete is a very colorful building block, making it very versatile and useful of styling. In contrast to terracotta, however, concrete displays its color cleanly, as opposed to terracotta which displays its chosen color on top of its own base color, causing it to distort all colors and make them appear slightly darker than they should be. Additionally, concrete's surface is completely smooth, flawless and clean of blemishes, allowing it to be used for giving of a more clean and pure look, suitable for emulating modern architecture.                                                                                                             | Comes in many different colors, providing many variations for decoration.<br/>Not flammable.<br/>Competely smooth surface, making for a much cleaner look.<br/>Displays its color perfectly, without any distortions (compare terracotta).<br/>                                                                                                                                                      | Somewhat expensive and time-consuming to make: Made from concrete powder, which is itself made from sand, gravel, and dye.
