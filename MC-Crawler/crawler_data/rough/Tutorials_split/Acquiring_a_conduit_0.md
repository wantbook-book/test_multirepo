## Heart of the sea
Heart of the sea items cannot be farmed. They generate only in buried treasure chests, which are difficult to find.

### Step 1: Underwater breathing
Before diving down underwater, a player should secure a way to breathe underwater. This can be done with doors‌[Java Edition  only], turtle shells, Water Breathing potions, helmets with the Respiration enchantment, and bubble columns.

A simple but time-consuming way to extend your underwater time is to obtain a helmet with the Respiration enchantment. Even one level of Respiration doubles your normal 15-second underwater time to 30 seconds, and each level of Respiration adds another 15 seconds.

You can try fishing until you obtain a book with a Respiration enchantment, and use an anvil to enchant a helmet.

Or, you can find a zombie spawner to create a drowned or zombie farm to get enchanted gold armor in Hard difficulty, which may include a Respiration-enchanted helmet dropped by zombies when they drown or die. If you are playing Bedrock Edition, you can also use this farm to obtain nautilus shells, which are necessary for crafting the conduit.

### Step 2: Treasure maps
Buried treasure maps can be found in shipwrecks and underwater ruins chests. These structures can be found just about everywhere in oceans, and underwater ruins are usually marked with bubble columns, sea lanterns or drowned.

Optionally, the player can feed a nearby dolphin, which then leads the player to a structure with treasure.

#### Shipwrecks
If you are fortunate enough to find a shipwreck in reasonably shallow water (enough for you to dive down, linger for about 5 seconds, and return to the surface), go straight for the map chest. This is located in the lower section of the stern of the ship. You likely have to open a door to get into that section. Open the chest, get the map (not the blank pieces of paper, but the paper with a mark on it), and don't be distracted by anything else. Return to the surface immediately after obtaining the map. If you want to explore the ship, save it for another breath.

### Step 3: Following the map
Buried treasure maps are usually blank with a white indicator dot. This shows where the player is in relation to the buried treasure. Remember that upward on the map is north and rightward on the map is east. As the player gets closer to the treasure, the indicator dot increases in size until they start filling in map features. Traveling may involve a long boat ride. Upon reaching the red "X" use a shovel to start digging 2×2 or 2×3 around that area to find the treasure chest. A more convenient method is to dig straight down the center of the chunk when at the red "X" (chunk coordinate 9,?,9 in Java Edition, 8,?,8 in Bedrock Edition), because treasure chests always generate in this certain position in a chunk. A buried treasure chest always contains a heart of the sea.

## Nautilus shells
Depending on your setup, obtaining eight nautilus shells could be tedious.

### Method 1: Fishing
Fishing is practical and easy, yielding an occasional nautilus shell as a treasure catch. Fishing this may also yield enchanted fishing rods that improve the catch rate and chance of treasure. The odds of receiving a nautilus shell from fishing with an unenchanted rod are 0.7%, so you have to spend a lot of time fishing.

Always fish in open water, otherwise you don't catch nautilus shells or other treasure, you just catch fish and junk. Fishing directly under the sky while it's raining decreases waiting time between bites.

### Method 2: Drowned
Drowned have a chance to drop nautilus shells, but ease of obtaining them depends on the edition.

- Java Edition:Drowned have a 3% chance to spawn carrying a nautilus shell. If they do, they are guaranteed to drop it. Only naturally-spawned drowned carry nautilus shells; zombies converted to drowned do not.
- Bedrock Edition:Drowned have an 8% chance to spawn holding a nautilus shell. If it is holding a nautilus shell in the offhand it is a guaranteed drop. Also, converting zombies into drowned resets the drop counters, giving newly-converted drowned the same chance to spawn with a nautilus shell. Therefore, nautilus shells are most easily obtained conduit ingredient in Bedrock Edition. If you find adungeonwith a zombiespawner, then building a basicflooded dungeon drowned farmis the simplest and most efficient way to produce nautilus shells inBedrock EditionSurvival mode, yielding more nautilus shells than a player would ever need.
