This is similar to the 3×3, except that players dig out the edge of a 5 by 5 grid. The center column is cleared, acting as a supply of light on the way down. The middle acts as a safety barrier, and the outer ring has the staircase itself. The middle can also be hollowed (digging straight down should be safe so long as the player didn't find any caves or lava pools as they have made the staircase) out and a ladder or waterfall can be placed in it, with openings at different levels to allow for quick and easy access. Note that climbing ladders does not deplete hunger, unlike walking and jumping used to travel the outer ring. Swimming does deplete hunger, but since they have less distance to travel, they still come out ahead.

This design drops the player 16 layers each full turn, and provides an exploratory dig over a wider region. At the same time, it has a bigger chance to miss things in-between the spirals.

Additional Staircases

With a shaft of 4×4 or more, two staircases on opposite sides of the shaft going in the same clockwise direction can be added, allowing horizontal 'satellite shafts' to be added on each flight of stairs on opposite sides if the shaft, allowing for extremely efficient and exhaustive mining, and in shafts of 5×5 or more, a staircase can be added on every side of the shaft for an even more productive mine.

##### Room Spiral
This is variation of the spiral which consists of a spiral of 5×5 rooms leading down. Simply dig a straight staircase down for a short while, then dig out a 5×5 room and add a torch or two. Turn right or left, and dig another staircase for a short while, and dig out another 5×5 room, add a torch, and so on. Remember to always turn the same way. This method allows players to find a large number of ores. If they hit bedrock, don't worry, go back up to the first room and turn the opposite direction this time. It is very helpful if players want to avoid lava and such. It also has the tendency to open up underground caves, which are always well-stocked with ores and gems. Just remember to be careful of monsters, so always bring a sword when using this method.

##### Steep Diagonal
If one wishes to mine straight down, but needs to get up and down quickly, a steep diagonal staircase is useful.  This method resembles a straight 1×2 staircase that has been folded onto itself for space efficiency.  To achieve this, simply place stair blocks in a descending 1×2 pattern, with each one leading into the next.  Repeat these units, descending 2 blocks every time until the desired length is reached.

Example of a steep diagonal staircase.
To ascend, center yourself with the middle halves of the stair blocks and tap A and D alternatively.  To descend, center yourself and walk forward.  If a clearance of 2 blocks is left above the highest stair in a unit, one may fall to each successive unit without taking fall damage.

### Vertical shaft mining
Vertical shafts are mined vertical tunnels used to gain access to underground mining sites. They can be of any width starting from  2×1 blocks,or 1×1. Don't forget to keep a water bucket and a stack of blocks in your hotbar, to deal with lava quickly.

Also known as "Digging straight down". While there is a 62% chance of reaching bedrock and a 27% of landing in a cave, the player has a small chance of falling into dangerous places like lava (8%) or ravines (3%) (100 tests) (percentages from a video Mumbo Jumbo produced). If you absolutely must be the crazy one, try this: Put a bed and a chest at the top. Sleep in the bed, and put everything from your inventory into the chest except for pickaxes, ladders, a stack each of gravel and cobblestone, and perhaps some torches. Dig down until the player dies or reaches their target depth, placing ladders above the player as they go. Every 5 levels or so, cut a 2-block high foothold opposite the ladder. If they fell into a cavern and survived, pillar jump back to the hole the player fell out of, and/or build a cobble pillar in front of players, and put ladders on that. If they fall into a cavern and die, the footholds might let them break the ladders below it so they can drop gravel for a pillar, and perhaps retrieve any ore they have found on the way down, but be watch out for the hostile mobs. If the player fell into lava, they can forget about the ore, but perhaps they can drop water to quench the lava.

It is possible to do this method safely, but it is very time-consuming. It's the same as before, except hold Shift to cling to the ladder while mining straight down. This way, if they mine into a pit or lava, they won't fall into it unless they unhold Shift (Shift won't let the player move down the ladder, but makes the mining speed slower). If the player does find a cave, they can climb up a little bit, remove the last ladder the player put down, and put a bucket of water there instead. Now they can swim down, and if there was lava under the player, it will turn into obsidian, and will be harmless. They can also dig 1 deep and 2 wide alcoves in the side, giving them a place to put a torch, rest, and most importantly dig the hole deeper as far as they can reach without having to hold onto the ladder.

Note that mining upward in a 1×1 shaft can actually be safer, if the player are placing ladders as they go up. Lava will be blocked by the ladder, which can't burn (and even if it could, there's no place for a fire block to appear).
