### Killing the dragon
If you are not sure that you have destroyed all of the crystals, let the dragon fly away. If you see a healing beam, then there is still a crystal left. Once the last crystals have been destroyed you can start to attack the dragon. You can also swap out your extra blocks with your water bucket, because you do not need the blocks anymore. There are many ways to attack the dragon, but there are many things to watch out for.

#### Healing
The dragon has three types of attacks: body attacks, the breath attack, and dragon fireballs. The more crystals you have destroyed, the more often the dragon attacks you. It inflicts 15 × 7.5 damage if it hits you with its head on hard mode, but its wings inflict only 7 damage (without armor). The dragon's breath inflicts 6 damage per second. The dragon has an extremely high knockback ability and can throw the player into the air to fatal heights, so they should keep drinking their slow falling potions when they run out. They make the player immune to all fall damage.

Keep track of health at all times. If you take at least 12 × 6 damage at a time, hide behind a tower and eat a golden apple. You should use your healing potions if you're on the brink of death to recover instantly. If the totem of undying in your hand goes off, and you have another totem, quickly throw it in your off hand and resume fighting immediately.

####

It is extremely useful to collect the dragon's breath during the fight because it can be used to make lingering potions, which can help if you want to fight the dragon again, or if you want to fight the wither (if you chose to fight the dragon first).

To collect the dragon's breath, wait for the dragon to perch and do its breath attack or shoot a dragon fireball, either of which puff out into lingering purple clouds. The only difference is that the dragon's breath comes instantly from the breath attack, whereas you must wait for the fireball to slam into the ground. To collect it, simply hold out an empty bottle and scoop up the clouds in the same way you would fill a bottle with water. However, you should avoid making contact with the clouds, because the clouds cause damage. Armor cannot protect you from damage from the dragon's breath, because it counts as magic damage. The dragon's breath is stackable, so you should collect as much as possible. Additionally, the leftover bottles from your used potions can increase your collection.

#### Attacking
While the dragon is flying you can shoot it with your bow or crossbow. However, the dragon is difficult to shoot because it can fly fast, and shots miss if they don't line up properly. It is recommended to shoot at a spot in the dragon's flight trajectory, which is the area in front of it, and it flies far enough to get hit by the arrow. Try to mainly shoot it in the head because the dragon takes the most damage on its head.

The more crystals you have destroyed, the more often the dragon dives at the portal. When it's hovering over the portal, it is immune to arrow damage, and you are forced to use your sword. Here, get as many critical hits as possible, which deal more damage, however it is not possible to get critical hits when you have Slow Falling. It is also suggested to drink a strength potion because you can inflict more damage using the strength the potion provides.

After a few minutes, the dragon's behavior changes. It dives at the portal once for every circle, so you should make sure that you always have the strength from the potions when the dragon perches. Remember the pattern of the dragon’s attacks, so that your attacks can be efficient for the rest of the battle.

Once 200 × 100 damage has been inflicted, the dragon dies and drops four rare rewards.

## Alternative Strategy
A alternative approach (for Java edition only) to defeating the ender dragon is based on trapping it in downflowing water while it is attempting to perch.  This allows the player to easily attack the dragon until it dies, for example, by using a bow.




## The rewards
When killed, the dragon floats upward and disintegrates, with bright purple beams of light erupting from its body. It then explodes and causes a sound effect to play that gradually fades away into the infinite darkness of the End, leaving almost no trace that it was ever there. Four rewards then appear.

### Experience
What the ender dragon looks like a few seconds after being killed.
After the dragon disappears, experience orbs rain from the sky. These orbs can take the player from level 0 to level 68, which is worth 12,000 experience points. Some of the orbs may fall into the portal, so run a few laps around the portal and then sneak on the rim of the portal to grab some more. Since it takes progressively more experience to gain a level at higher levels, the player gains enough to make over ten level 30 enchantments. The best time for the player to enchant extra equipment is as soon as they go back home, in case they die and lose all of the precious levels they have earned (unless you have a lot of experience farms to get more levels than that).

### Dragon egg
The second reward is the dragon egg. It sits on top of the portal when it first appears. However, it cannot be broken directly, as the egg teleports if the player attempts to do so. 

Instead, touch the egg once and let it teleport to a block of end stone. If the player can't find it, follow the purple teleportation particles. To pick up the egg, place a torch two blocks underneath it, and break the end stone block it is sitting on. Since the egg obeys the law of gravity, it falls onto the torch and break as a collectible item. If you forget to bring a torch with you, take one from the exit portal frame or use any other transparent/half block like a button, slab or pressure plate.

Alternatively, if the player has a piston and a source of redstone (such as a lever), place the piston facing the egg and power it with the redstone source. The egg still breaks as a collectible item. To prevent the egg from falling into the portal, cover the portal with blocks.

If the player uses either of these strategies, they obtain the dragon egg successfully. It currently has no use other than as a trophy to show that the player has defeated the ender dragon, but it can serve as a beautiful decoration or an addition to a trophy room at the player’s base.
