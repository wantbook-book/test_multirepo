### Operation
Operational drowned farm as described above, showing a drowned and a zombie not yet drowned. The recessed area in the floor with stone slabs gives the player a better vantage point for whacking at the legs.
Go down into your collection room. As zombies fall into the water-trap channel, they wander back and forth across the tops of the hoppers with their heads in the water channel. After 30 seconds of having its head submerged, a zombie starts to drown, quivering visibly for 15 seconds, and then changes color. Its pants turn from blue to greenish. Its eyes, visible through the glass blocks, also change to a blue glow.

The legs of the mobs are exposed to you. With your cheap weapon, or even bare hands, whack at the legs of a drowned. Four hits with a stone sword can kill it. Experience orbs float toward you, and the drowned's possessions drop into the hoppers and end up in the chest (or if you didn't use hoppers, the drops come to you if you get close enough). Eventually nautilus shells‌[Bedrock Edition  only], as well as copper ingots, armor (leather, gold, and chainmail, often enchanted) appear in the collection chest along with rotten flesh and miscellaneous other items.

The chest fills quickly because weapons and armor each occupy their own inventory slots. You may find it useful to have a garbage disposal hole in the ground somewhere in the room in which to throw unwanted items, which despawn after a few minutes in the hole. You can combine unenchanted armor and weapons in a grindstone to repair them, thereby saving space in your chest.

Spawning room full of monsters, with drowning platform below built to bypass the mob cap.
Killing platform with dozens of drowned and zombies due bypassing the mob cap. This becomes a good source of gold or iron from zombies, and copper from drowned.
Baby zombies occasionally spawn, but they don't drown because they're too short. Simply kill these when they appear. The slabs under the glass blocks prevent them from escaping, and also prevent them from attacking you (although they can still hit downward if you get too close). Zombie villagers also spawn occasionally, and can be killed immediately because they don't drown.

To bypass the mob cap, make sure that part of the drowning platform is outside the 9×9×9 volume (in Java Edition) or the 16×10×16 volume (in Bedrock Edition) centered on the lower northwest corner of the spawner. This is easily accomplished by expanding the dungeon to 9×9, lowering the floor two blocks below the spawner, and building the killing platform so that it extends away from the spawner. When a zombie or drowned wanders outside that volume, it is no longer counted in the mob cap and the spawner keeps producing more zombies. This way it is possible to have over 100 zombies and drowned crowded into your farm.

### 
If you are in a situation where there isn't any way to build an iron golem farm for iron (say you are playing an island survival game and there is no village within thousands of blocks), or a gold farm for gold, you feel like you've mined out your area, and you no longer need drops from drowned, you can use a flooded dungeon farm to harvest iron and gold from the zombies, and copper from drowned. It's a slow but effective way to get iron and gold ingots. Gold ingots (mostly from gold armor smelted into nuggets) accumulate faster than iron ingots. The accumulation rate of copper ingots is in between gold and iron.

The flooded dungeon farm simply needs some minor modifications in your killing room:

1. Add another large chest, to keep special enchanted items.
2. Add a crafting table.
3. Add a furnace.
4. If you haven't done so already, dig small hole in the floor to discard unwanted items (leather, rotten flesh, plain gold items after you have enough gold, etc.)

Bring plenty of food, stock your furnace with fuel, craft a few stone swords, and do the following:

1. Switch toHard difficultyto maximize the zombie drops of gold and iron items.
2. Kill the zombies as they enter the killing chamber. You can wait for them to drown but you don't have to. The zombies still drop their items whether you kill them or if they convert into drowned. However, if you see an armored zombie, let it drown, because an armored zombie requires more hits to kill, and it drops the armor anyway when it drowns.‌[BE  only]
3. Periodically check the collection chest and remove any iron or gold items (and copper ingots from any drowned), and put them in your inventory.
	- If you get a sword or iron shovel, use it as a weapon butdon't use it until it breaks. This lets you avoid crafting more swords to kill the zombies. You're going to smelt it into a nugget, so you may as well get some use out of it first.
	- An iron sword kills a zombie or drowned in four hits. A shovel needs seven hits.
	- Pay attention to the durability as you use these swords or shovels. When the durability bar shows that the item is nearly depleted, put it in your inventory and move on to the next weapon. Don't try to repair them. You need each worn-out iron weapon or tool to get an iron nugget.
4. When your inventory is full, use the furnace to smelt your iron or gold items (especially the worn-out ones you used as weapons) into nuggets.
5. Use the crafting table to craft the nuggets into ingots.
6. Remove non-smeltable remaining items from your collection chest and throw them down the hole.
7. Repeat.

You can collect gold ingots rather quickly this way. Iron is much slower. With luck, you can collect enough iron nuggets to make about 5 ingots per hour. It's a grind, but depending on your situation, this may be a viable option to obtain iron. As a bonus, you accumulate a lot of experience while doing this.
