### Island Stronghold
Description

A large wall and ceiling over an island for lots of protection against mobs, similar to an Irish crannog.

Necessary Materials

About 100-2000 blocks of any building materials depending on the size of your island.

Location

On a small-medium island.

Construction

Find a decent size island and get lots of stone. Then, you build a 6-9 block wall with your stone. After you've done this, place torches everywhere over your walls and floor and get rid of them afterward if you need to build. Next, you add your roof and you can live hostile free!

Extras

- A small tunnel leading to a secondary base.
- A mine.
- Obsidian shelter in case that creeper one day gets you.
- Extra rooms
- A walled-off passage to the mainland

### Underwater Shelter
Description

An underwater base for total protection from creepers and other mobs, along with looking good. 

Necessary Materials

Any block; preferably glass.

Some form of light, glowstone, etc. Torches cannot be placed on the sides of glass, so be wary when utilizing glass for the walls.

Location

In a deep lake or in the ocean. Be careful to not build near ocean monuments so that guardians will not spawn.

Construction

Start by filling the space where you are going to build your house, then dig out the inside. Next, start removing the wall and replacing it with the block of your choice. Then, add your ceiling and replace the water on the top. For added ease build your house underwater out of wood then cover it with any non-flammable material. Now, dig one block under your house and burn it which will remove all the water. You now have a "creeper proof" house (unless it blows up the water without being in it, although this has only been proved with TNT). Make sure the surrounding area is lit up to prevent drowned from spawning.

Extras

- An underground base below this base.

- Glass walls and roofs, as the strength of the blocks doesn't matter.

### Freestanding - Hard
Description

The freestanding shelter, just bigger and harder to build and also with extra floors.

Necessary Materials

- Preferred building material (wooden planks, cobble. About 256-2048 blocks)
- Logs
- Glass panes and blocks
- Fences for patio and/or balcony
- Stairs
- Ladders (to get up or down your floors)
- Doors
- Trapdoors

Location

A large, flat area, with room for expansions, underground or to the side.

Construction

The size of the shelter is up to the player, however, the bigger your house is the more room you will have for expansion. 

1. Build the foundation of your house one block higher than the ground, so you can make a patio and as an added bonus you don't have to clear out the ground to make a floor.

2. Next, build your walls 5 blocks high so the ceiling isn't too low, and the windows don't look weird. The house will also feel bigger that way.

3. Make the ceiling. This means the inside of the house is currently 4 blocks high.

4. Make any rooms you want (crafting room, brewery, bedroom, etc.).

5. If you don't want a second floor, you're done! If you do want a second floor, continue on. Punch 1×1 hole in your ceiling. Pillar jump up on to your second floor, but as you keep going up and down you will have to destroy your pillar, so ladders are recommended here. For the second floor, repeat step 2, 3 and 4. If wanted, you can make glass skylights for both the roof and the floor of the 2nd level.

6. If you don't want an underground floor, you're done! If you do want an underground floor, continue on. Dig down 5 blocks from your floor. Next, hollow out the area you want to use. Dirt and stone don't really make great décor, so wooden planks are the preferred building material. Hollow out the wall and replace it with the planks. You can make entrances to all your expansions here. You may use ladders or stairs to get down to your underground floor.

7. If you don't want a balcony, you're done! If you do want a balcony, continue on. Go outside your house. Pillar jump to wherever you want to place your balcony. Use cobble or wooden planks. Extend your balcony about 3-5 blocks out. Add a fence and you're done! A nice extra is to put wooden steps and a sign by each side, so it looks like a chair.

Extras

- Greenhouse made out of glass (consider adding a chest or two for keeping your seeds and tools and a crafting table to make quick bread).

- Universal underground stopping point for all expansions (passageway to the guard tower, entrance to quarry or mine, iron door to emergency bunker, etc.)

- Craft Room. a room full of crafting tables and furnaces for quick crafting and smelting. Add a chest to store valuable ores and ingots.

- Emergency bunker. Creeper invading your house? Make an underground shelter made out of obsidian or 3 layers of cobble and an iron door. A bed is a must. A chest full of food, weapons and tools is needed. A workbench and a furnace are useful as well.

- Indoor fishing pond. Useful source of food if a greenhouse has not been created.

- Storeroom. A room full of chests to keep less valuable materials (dirt, cobble)

- Guard Tower. Make a tall tower (5×4) and about 30 blocks high to survey the land. Add a chest full of arrows and a bow to 'snipe' some mobs.

- Escape passage. This is a must! You can also add this to your bunker.

- Emergency kit. Need to leave quickly? Found a group of zombies in your basement? A chest full of weapons, food, crafting table, furnace and tools is helpful if invaded by an army of monsters.

- Tree farm. Although time-consuming, an indoor tree farm can be extremely useful. Note that the room must be tall enough to accommodate the trees. The room will have to be well-lit. Consider adding a chest full of axes and saplings.

- Skylight. Extra light and looks cool. Why not even make your roof out of glass? No mobs can spawn on it!

- Tunnel to another base. This is helpful if you need to go to another safehouse to collect more resources.
