### Undesirable
- Crowded— This can make biomes difficult to move around in smoothly, as well as requiring the player to landscape the environment if they intend to build. Biomes that contain an excessively large amount of trees can sheltermonstersduring the daytime and allow them to resume spawning under the cover of vegetation. Because of this, players can potentially get ambushed by groups of monsters at a time. Biomes that contain a lot of hills and mountains can cause similar ambush situations.

- Flooded— Due to the player's dampened speed in water, it can be difficult to navigate at speeds that you'd get on more land-based biomes. This, in turn, means that escaping dangerous situations and monsters are harder. It is also difficult to build large farms or structures. Mobs that die in sunlight can survive if they are within the water.Skeletonscan shoot the player in the safety of bodies of water whilezombiesmay sink and becomedrowned.

- No/Few Animals— Some biomes do not spawn animals when generated. Others lack grass, so animals cannot spawn over time.

- Scarce Wood— Some biomes contain few or notrees, forcing the player to resort to alternative methods of obtaining wood.

- Unsteady footing—Mountainsandjunglesoffer a greater chance of falling to one's death and may make it more difficult to build farms or homes on the surface. Hostile mobs can attack the player suddenly and can collect in valleys.Lavaflows are more hazardous due to the terrain, causing it to flow unpredictably.

- Lack of food- In some biomes like deserts, icy biomes, or small islands in the middle of the ocean, it is hard to find food and set up a constant food source.

## Overworld
The Overworld is the main dimension in Minecraft and the one the player spawns into on world creation. It is by far the easiest of the dimensions to live, being the one designed best for living in. It is also the only place you can use a bed, without it exploding. There are many different foods here, and the hostile mobs that spawn are often easier to defeat than those in other dimensions. The player has an abundance of biomes to choose from, each offering a different pro/con dichotomy for the player to consider.

## Surface biomes
### Plains
The plains is a good biome for a player's first house. The lack of obstruction makes it fairly quick to walk or sprint around. The flat ground makes it easy to create a large house, and villages are common. Horses spawn here, allowing for even faster transportation. There is a lot of tall grass, making it easy to collect seeds and start a wheat farm. This biome has many gullies and short hills. Wood is scarce, but forests are likely nearby.

#### Pros
- Flat landscape for easy building and traveling.
- Plentifultall grassfor initial seed farms.
- The presence of animals offers much-needed meat, and resources likeleatherandwool. Compared to other "green biomes" like the forest, the spawn rate of passive mobs is not increased, but the lack of obstruction makes them easier to find and offers more spawning areas that are usually covered with trees.
- Villages that offer great trades, potential chest loot, and maybe a good shelter.
	- Plains villages are also the only villages that can generate large houses, which have 4 beds.
- Horsesanddonkeysspawn exclusively here or in the savanna. Horses offer great mobility and combat advantage, while donkeys can be used for extra storage. InBedrock Edition, this is the only biome where donkeys can spawn.
- The sunflower plains is the only place to findsunflowers.
- The abundant tall grass can sometimes hide you from monsters (or surprise them), even when you're on the move.
- Bothwaterandlavalakes spawn here, often easily identified due to the flat landscape, and can provide plentiful resources for various advanced tasks.
- Fewer trees mean the undead have little protection from sunlight.
- Cornflowers generate here, used for blue dye.
- Bees and bee nests can spawn. This allows forhoney farmingwhich brings farming ofhoney bottles,honeycomb,honey blocksandbeehives.
- If you are on a multiplayer server and at your base, the lack of cover makes it hard for an enemy to sneak up to your base.
- Plains villages have large amounts ofhay bales, which can be made intobread.
- If you are looking forores, caves entrances (sometimes ravines) can be easily spotted from the surface.

#### Cons
- Trees are a somewhat uncommon, although the plains biome often has forests nearby.
- There are many open caves which can disrupt the flat landscape, and mobs such aszombiescan come out of the caves to attack you.
- When in combat the tall grass can often obstruct your melee attacks, while hostile mobs are not blocked by it.
- Skeletonsandwitchescan more easily shoot you down due to the lack of obstruction.
- Tall grass can clutter your inventory with seeds, and can be annoying to clear out when building a large structure.
- Lava lakes generate here, which can easily kill a player or animal and destroy any items dropped.
- Pillager outpostscan generate in the biome, and although it has loot chests, it spawnspillagersinfinitely around the structure and can easily kill unarmed players.
- On servers, a base here is easy to see and therefore may become a prime target for attack.

#### Useful resources
Sunflowers, seeds, meat, lava, horses, donkeys, villages and villagers, hay bales (from villages), cornflowers, pillager outposts, and bees are useful resources found in plains biomes.

#### Tips
- Consider building your first or permanent house here, with resources you've acquired from other biomes.
- It is highly recommended not to kill villagers or leave them vulnerable to zombies by breaking their houses for wood. Eventually,iron golem farmsand fully automaticcrop farmsall become possible through villagers. They are also the only renewable source of enchanted diamondtools,weaponsandarmor.
- Tall grass can be removed quickly by dumping water on the ground to wash it away, although this requires abucket.
- Build a more hidden house when on servers.
