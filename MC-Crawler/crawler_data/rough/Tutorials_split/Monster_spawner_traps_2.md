### Flow trap
This trap is highly recommended. It's effective and safe on all mobs, except blazes, since you need water. Disable the monster spawner, and then make a 10Ã—10 room around the monster spawner. On one side, place water on every block. On the opposite side, make a one-block deep trench extending along the side opposite the water. Light up the trench well. The holes have to be next to water. Now, get plenty of food, a few chests, and two or three swords. Remove the torches and let mobs spawn. The water will bring them to you, and you can shoot them and hit them. Also, make a room to eat and heal in safety, just in case you didn't build the trap thoroughly. With this trap, you can go for hours in one go, and gain a massive amount of experience levels and items at minimum risk. The trap system is built in a way where you can easily leave when you want, with almost no creepers or non-monster-spawner mobs popping up.

If the monster spawner is a spider, make these adjustments:

- Add iron doors with levers to control mob flooding and possible death.
- Bring milk for cave spiders.
- Add an on/off lighting system.
- Bring bows to help control mob flooding and possible death.

### Sunlight based traps
This type only applies to zombie and skeleton monster spawners. Sunlight-based traps are made by placing water below a monster spawner. This water will flow from one side to another. Where the water stops, dig a pit a few levels down. This will drop the mobs into the pit. To finish, make sure that the pit is open to sunlight. This sunlight will burn the mobs alive. An example of this can be found here: https://youtu.be/1AijahlBqyU .

### Potion-based trap
This is a fairly expensive and hard-to-make trap, so it's not recommended.

First: Light up the room to prevent mobs from spawning.

Second: On top, dig out 2 blocks from the monster spawner room top without breaking the monster spawner roof.

Third: Place the wires and dispensers like shown:

DWWWWWD    X - Roof Block
XXXWXXX    W - Wires
XXXWXXX    D - Dispenser looking in the monster spawner room
XXXLXXX    L - Lever, button or even a redstone clock, whatever you want to power
XXXWXXX        the dispensers up!
XXXWXXX
DWWWWWD 

Fourth: Put inside the dispensers:

HARMING POTIONS: Used to damage spiders.
HEALING POTIONS: Used to damage skeletons and zombies.
POISON POTIONS: Used to weaken any mob that is not undead.

Fifth and last, but not least: Take the lights out, get up, and when you hear the mob noises, push the lever/to activate clock/ whatever you used to power it up.

### Iron golem traps
In this trap an iron golem is used to kill the monsters for you. To make it, simply make an iron golem in the dungeon and watch it kill for you. However, the iron golem will eventually die (especially if more than 1 mob is spawned), so you'll have to replace it with another, or link it to an iron golem farm.

### Wolf traps
Similarly to the Iron Golem trap, have tamed wolves kill mobs for you. However, this only works for skeleton dungeons, as wolves will only automatically target skeletons. Additionally, as wolves have much less health than golems, you'll need to either have many wolves available, or weaken the skeletons beforehand (i.e. a large fall). The benefit of wolf traps over golem traps is that kills from tamed wolves can produce experience and extra loot.

### Cactus traps
The following cactus trap is designed for spiders. It has a chance of destroying the items, but this is an inherent issue with cacti (this can also incorporate a small cactus farm by placing a block 2 blocks above the cacti).

1. Dig the main channel. The spider monster spawner is left in the wall forcing spiders to spawn on the small dry patch.
2. Dig two blocks down and one block in just before the cacti. These two holes will hold the collection water sources.
3. Place three ladders on the far side of the collection output. Place one on either piece of sand. Place the two water sources in the holes.
4. Place the main water in the two openings. The block between them makes the water flow towards the gap in the cacti, slightly improving the collection rate of string.
5. Cover the entire trap and remove all lights.

- Main channel, dry.
- Collection channel, dry.
- Collection channel, water and ladder placement.
- Main channel, water flow.
- Both channels. Front view.

### Fall damage
Fall damage onto hoppers is another option for killing mobs and collecting items automatically.

### Villager traps
This trap only works with zombies. Both rooms in this design must be very dark. The zombies will try to get the villagers, they will fall through a hole, and if the room was high enough, kill themselves in doing so!

1. First make a room high above the ground and move at least 2 villagers to it.
2. Now put at least nine doors in it.
3. Next change one of the walls to glass.
4. Attach another room to the side that the glass wall is on.
5. Mine a hole in the floor of the empty room.
6. Line the hole with open trap doors (if your hole is 2 by 2 you will need 4 trap doors)
7. Directly under the hole, make a room without a roof on the ground.

### Blaze traps
One way to make a blaze farm is to box in the monster spawner, so that the blazes can't fly away. Leave a space at the blazes foot level and stand so that your eye level is at that space. That way the blazes can't hit you (mostly), but you can hit them. This is also a pretty good experience farm since each blaze drops twice as much xp as other mobs with its health. Be warned, however, that sometimes blazes will spawn outside the box so it is advised that one box themselves in as well.
