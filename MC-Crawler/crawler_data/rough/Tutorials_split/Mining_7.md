### Branch Mining
Branch mining consists of mining out side tunnels from an access shaft to expose as many blocks as possible with a minimum of blocks removed.

Creating a Branch Mine is simple. First, dig deep underground until 0-16 blocks above the bottom level. To keep track of this, press F3‌[JE  only] or type /gamerule showcoordinates true‌[BE  only], and the Y-coordinate tells the vertical level the player character is currently at (It is best to mine at level 11 because it is easier to deal with lava lakes on that height). Upon reaching the desired level, begin to dig at least 20 blocks into a wall to create a shaft. Come out of the shaft, move at least 3 blocks to the left or right, and do the same again, digging 20 blocks into the wall. Each shaft made will almost always contain a resource block ranging from coal, iron, redstone to even gold and diamond.

There is a tradeoff between the spacing chosen between each branch of the mine. A spacing of 2 blocks per branch means that players will end up exposing almost every block, but at the cost of a lot of work. A spacing of 5 blocks per branch will give them a wider area covered but there is the possibility of missing some blobs, especially diamond or lapis lazuli which can appear in blobs of less than 4 blocks. Using the diagram titled "More compact 3-Space branch mine" (open the "Offsetting mine levels" collapsible to see it) leaves no ores hidden, however requires them mine more stone. It is recommended to use this method if they don't mind mining a bit extra and really need the gold, redstone, diamond, iron, and coal.

#### Layout 1
The trade-off for spacing can be minimized by making a branch mine a level above and below the first branch mine that is offset from it. (This is a side view) For example:

#### Layout 2
Another option is the per-chunk branch mine. This is a 2 space branch mine, but is constructed over the space of a single chunk, and is capable of ensuring that every ore deposit is found, while still only mining around 45% of the chunk's stone. For the initial shaft to bedrock for this mine, a 1×2 shaft will fit lengthwise in the central corridor. Also, considering in most cases each chunk have one diamond ore blob, if their only priority is diamonds, they can place the top most branches at level 14 & 15 and dig branches from top to bottom until they strike a diamond blob and then skip the rest of the chunk.

#### Layout 3

An effective technique if players want to find rare resources with minimal effort. It is basically mining down to any level, usually to bedrock, and then mining outwards to the sides, much like a tree with a trunk and branches. 

1. Use the staircase method to dig down to bedrock.
2. Go up 2 blocks and fill any space below they have mined out.
3. Dig a 3×3 room.
4. Dig a straight 2×1 tunnel in a straight line then dig out 32 blocks every 4th block.
5. (Optional) If the player don't want to count to 32 every branch, dig out a "Marker" 1×1 tunnel 4 blocks in and stop by it in the next branch.
6. To further increase efficiency, the player can end the 20-block tunnel by digging 4 blocks of an 1×1 tunnels as each of the mined block reveals more than a 2×1 tunnel.

This method is based on the relatively low probability of desirable blocks being created without any neighbors, so it will occasionally miss small or narrow ore deposits that fall entirely between the branches, but it covers ground faster, so players will usually get more ore for their time. If the player would rather be sure of 100% coverage, simply place the tunnels closer together. It is also meant to be done quickly.

                           X = Tunnel "Trunk"
                           B = Branch
                           S = Staircase
                           Y = Outpost (for supplies, etc.)
                           - = (Optional) 1×1 block tunnel

          B       B        S        B       B
          B       B        S        B       B
          B       B        S        B       B

          B-------B        S        B-------B

Each branch can be any length, but about 32 blocks long is a good length to begin with, as it can be measured with the durability of a stone pickaxe.

The Pinwheel Mining layout:

The Pinwheel Mining layout is designed to cover large squares of land, over long periods of time. 

1. Get to the diamond layer by the player's preferred method,
2. Dig out a room-as large as 10×10×8 if the player want to set it up as a self-sufficient base, or as small as 4×4×2 if the player just want to get mining, and use even numbers if they like 2×2 access shafts or odd numbers if they prefer 1×2 access shafts.
3. Mark the access shafts into the middle of the walls; the picture shows 2×2 tunnels. If players do not use the wide tunnels, mark the main shafts with signposts.
4. Dig a given access shaft out until their inventory is full. They'll have plenty of chances to get the ores out of the access shafts.
5. Note: If they use a simple straight staircase to get down, they may need to leave off the south tunnel for a while.
6. Mark the branches at the desired interval. The picture shows a spacing of 2, which is 100% thorough but inefficient.
7. Dig out each branch until their inventory is 3 spaces away from full, then turn around.
8. On the way back, place torches in any dark spots, and collect any missed ores — collecting all the coal is advised, but not required.

As always, the player can use any spacing; a spacing of three provides both reasonable efficiency and reasonable thoroughness.

This layout can compete with the phoenix mine in terms of efficiency, and is easier to modify if necessary, but it does require a lot of time for each trip.
