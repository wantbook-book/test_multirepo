### Construction











































































































































































































































Side view of a drowned farm. It can be made with a single hopper but works better with more, so the mobs spread out for easier targeting. The lower-level water is surrounded by glass blocks with slabs attached to the bottoms to prevent baby zombies from escaping. Signs are visible behind the slabs, holding up the water. The hole next to the chest allows for easy disposal of unwanted items, which despawn a few minutes after being thrown into the hole.
The illustration on the right shows a side view of a basic drowned farm, showing the dungeon above and the trap / collection room below.

#### Prepare the dungeon
Upon locating a dungeon and breaking into it:

1. Quickly place a torch on the mob spawner block to prevent it from spawning further zombies.
2. Use your good weapon to kill any remaining zombies in the room.
3. Close off any holes in the walls other than the entrance way you intend to use to get in and out of the room.
4. Ransack and collect the chests for later use.
5. It is not necessary to dig out the floor around the mob spawner, but doing so lets the spawner use its full vertical spawning volume. Digging out two layers allows mobs that spawn upstream of the spawner to be be swept underneath without getting stuck. You may also optionally expand the room to 4 blocks horizontally from the monster spawner block (a 9Ã—9 room). The room still produces more than enough zombies without these expansions, however.

Take note of the coordinate location of the center block along the wall with your opening. This floor block is in line with the mob spawner. In the last step, you flood the dungeon with water and dig a hole in this location for the mobs to fall through.

After preparation, exit through your opening. Don't close it off yet.

#### Prepare the trap
Next, underneath the dungeon, excavate the trap room. The room should be large enough to move around in, and contain the trap described below.

At the most basic level, the trap consists of a single water block that the zombie falls through from above, landing on a block (or a hopper) so the zombie's head remains in the water and drowns it. A sign on the wall holds up the bottom of the water block, and solid blocks enclose the water on all sides. The enclosing blocks may be glass to aid your identification of drowned zombies versus non-drowned zombies.

With a one-water-block trap, zombies just crowd into that one-block space, making it difficult to target the drowned zombies with your weapon. Allow the zombies to spread out as they drown by extending the trap to multiple blocks. In practice, a trap using a two-block water channel held up with two signs, with two landing blocks (or hoppers) below the channel, works sufficiently well. The illustration shows a design using a three-block water channel, three signs, and three hoppers.

1. Place blocks (preferably glass) on the ceiling to contain the water channel. One long side of the channel can be bounded by the wall of your room. The channel should be directly below the floor block previously measured in the dungeon above. This is where the water falls through into the channel.
2. Place signs along the wall. The signs hold up the bottom of the water blocks while providing air space for you and mobs to pass by the signs.
3. Using a water bucket, place a block of water on each end of the channel. If your channel is 3 blocks long, you need only two water blocks; the center block fills itself in. The channel must be completely full of still water. Running water allows for some breathing space; you want to avoid that.
4. Onlyafterfilling the channel with water, place the hoppers under each sign, pointing toward the chest at the end of the line. Be outside the channel before you install the hoppers, lest you end up drowning yourself.
	- Hoppers are needed only to collect drops and move them into the chest.
	- If you can't afford hoppers (due to the amount of iron required), you can use stone blocks. In this case, just dig a 1-block trench next to these stone blocks so that you can fit underneath the overhead slabs, to get close enough to the dropped items to collect them yourself.
5. Place slabs underneath the glass to create a half-block high space, enough for you to swing a sword at the drowned's legs, but not enough for baby zombies to slip through.

#### Start the farm
Finally, go back into the dungeon above.

1. Place two water blocks, one at each corner opposite your entrance opening. The water should completely fill the room, sweeping you toward the entrance. If you have expanded the room and the water doesn't cover the whole floor, you may need an additional water block on each side wall, or build a stone structure in the far corners for the water to cascade down and spread more. If you stand anywhere in the room, the water should push you toward the center of the wall at your entrance hole.
2. Stand on the threshold of your entrance,out of the water, to avoid drowning yourself in this step. Dig out the floor block at the center of the wall, causing the water to spill down into the channel in the collection room below. The reason to dig this hole after flooding the dungeon is because placing a water block near a hole causes theflow direction rulesto prevent the water from covering the entire room.
3. Break the torch on the mob spawner. A zombie spawns the instant the torch breaks. Quickly seal the opening of the dungeon. You can seal it with glass blocks as shown in the illustration, to let you see into the dungeon. You can recover the torch from the chest below.
4. If no zombies spawn, the light level in the spawning room may be too bright. Adjust your arrangement of torches outside the room accordingly.
