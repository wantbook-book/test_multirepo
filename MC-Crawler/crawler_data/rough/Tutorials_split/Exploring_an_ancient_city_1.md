## Starting out
To prepare yourself for an expedition to an ancient city, there are a few things you need to do.

### Finding a city
To locate an ancient city, you first need to make sure you're in the right biome. Ancient cities are found exclusively in deep dark biomes, which are more likely to occur beneath tall mountains, and never generate below aquatic biomes like oceans, rivers and swamps, so make sure not to waste your time digging underneath the wrong biomes. When you locate a mountain biome, dig down at the foot of the mountain to Y=-51, and then start tunneling horizontally towards it. This gives you the highest chance of finding a deep dark biome. 

Once you find a deep dark biome, start exploring around until you find an ancient city. Not all deep dark biomes contain an ancient city, so you likely have to explore multiple deep dark biomes until you find one. While you explore, try to stay between the Y-levels -30 and -50 as much as possible, as these are the coordinates between which ancient cities may generate.

A more tedious, but more guaranteed way is to dig parallel tunnels at Y=-51 in a zigzag pattern: dig a long horizontal tunnel, and when you reach the end of the deep dark biome, dig to the side for a few hundred blocks, and then turn around to dig another tunnel. Tunnels should be spaced about 200 blocks from each other; ancient cities have a massive footprint of about 220 blocks on each horizontal axis, so they cannot be missed even when tunnels are spaced that far apart.

You should approach and reach the ancient city either from the same level or from below, as if you mine into it from above, you run the risk of falling directly into it. If you survive fall damage, then death likely comes from the warden.

### What not to do
- Try not to build or destroy anything except Wool-related blocks unless you are sure there are not anysculk shriekersorsculk sensorswithin a 9-block radius.
- Try not to take any damage, keep your health bar at full, just in case.  While taking fall damage doesn't alert nearby sensors as long as you are sneaking, consuming food to heal your healthdoesalert them.
- Try your hardest to avoid alerting sculk shriekers or sculk sensors, so do not step on them, let alone go anywhere near them except to break them.
- Fighting the warden is suicide! There are no incentives whatsoever for doing killing it besides getting a sculk catalyst. Instead, try to be as far away as possible, because it may detect your presence the closer you are to it and be able to track you down, with fatal results.
- Don't use the ladders generated in the ancient city. Climbing a ladder causes vibration, and that might trigger sculk sensors and shriekers nearby. Instead, pillar up using wool blocks.

## Exploring the city
When you explore the city, the most important thing is to sneak at all times, unless you are on the corridors with gray wool walkways. This causes slower movement unless you have Swift Sneak on your leggings, which you wouldn't have if this is your first trip to an Ancient City, as it can be found only in an ancient city. However, there is a trick to sneak faster: sneak diagonally. When pressing two directional keys (such as forward and right) at the same time, the player moves at a faster 1.8 m/s as opposed to 1.3 m/s. This can make it hard to see where you are going, so you can use the third-person view to get an eagle eye view of your character. but if you first run and jump and then press shift, you will also move forward quickly.

Use your potions of Night Vision to see without having to place torches (as that potentially alerts sculk sensors and shriekers). Torches, however, are useful as a last resort if you run out of Night Vision potions or are under the Darkness effect, so use your night vision to identify spots where a sculk shrieker or sculk sensor cannot detect the sound, and place torches in those places, so that you can see by their light later. There may be some areas where it is extremely difficult to get through if you have run out of night vision potions or have the darkness effect and you should simply avoid these areas. Lastly, you can throw your snowballs into an area to check how many sensors there are, or if the area is safe. Additionally, doing this at a distance allows you to stay out of range of the warden that spawns if it is your fourth time activating a shrieker within ten minutes, for the warden spawns relative to the sculk shrieker, not the player. However, this technique should still be used only when you have a good escape plan.

### Destroying sculk shriekers
The most dangerous block in the ancient city by far is the sculk shrieker, as it is directly responsible for spawning in the wardens. So one of the most important things to do when exploring an ancient city, is to destroy all the sculk shriekers to stop that from happening, or place wool around them to stop vibrations. Breaking the sculk shrieker triggers nearby sculk sensors, which can in turn alert other shriekers nearby, so placing wool is the recommended choice. Breaking all sculk shriekers without spawning any wardens is a challenging task, but it is not impossible. To do so, the player needs to understand how the Sculk Shrieker works.

#### Mechanics
Main article: Sculk Shrieker § Usage
When a sculk shrieker activates, it starts shrieking but it does not actually spawn a warden right away. It does so after its shrieking has finished, if you have activated a shrieker four times. The shrieking lasts for a total of 4.5 seconds, during which the player can do a couple of things to utilize the situation:

- The player most likely cannot run out of the sculk shrieker's range. A sculk shrieker has a spherical range of 40 blocks.If the player gets outside the 40-block radius before the 4.5-second shrieking ends, then the shrieker does not inflict Darkness on the player or spawn the warden.This option is viable only if there are no other shriekers nearby to break.
- The player can break the shrieker before its shrieking ends. Ahoeis the fastest way to break shriekers, so a player with a fast hoe can quickly break multiple shriekers within a short period of time, allowing for a dangerous but faster way to raid and secure the city.
	- Be warned that if a shrieker is attempting to spawn aWarden, breaking the shriekerimmediatelyspawns a warden, even if it hasn't finished shrieking yet.
