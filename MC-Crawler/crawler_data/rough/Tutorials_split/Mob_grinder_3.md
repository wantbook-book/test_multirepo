### Sweet berry bush
Sweet berry bush grinder
Sweet Berry Bushes deal damage to mobs (except foxes) as they move through the bushes. Sweet Berries result in a slow grinder as they deal damage only when the mob moves. Sweet berries can be placed only on top of grass blocks, dirt, podzol, coarse dirt, or farmland.

### Floor-suffocation grinder

  

This tutorial is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition. 


This grinder involves surrounding a 4×4 pit with pistons, one block above the floor of the pit. Have mobs pushed into the pit, and attach the pistons to a loop or a lever so that the pistons quickly go on and off, causing the entities inside the pit to fall into the floor and suffocate. This requires that there is a one-block tall space beneath the floor of the pit, so that the mobs can fall. This kills extremely quickly. 

## Item collection
You may want to collect items automatically after the mobs have been killed. An easy way to do this is to place a hopper at the end of your water flow or wherever your items drop out. A double chest can then be placed under or next to the hopper to contain the items. If there is a large area where the items can land, you may need multiple hoppers, or manage water flows to move items into a single destination hopper.

For more complicated designs, you can also use hopper minecarts. Hopper minecarts can pick up items through solid blocks, so you can easily run a rail line underneath the blocks where items rest. Rail lines are often useful as an alternative to many hoppers or in combination with magma rock grinders
