## Breeding and population cap
Main articles: Villager § Breeding and Breeding
Villagers can breed without player intervention, but there must be at least two adult villagers who can reach one another.

Villagers go into love mode (indicated by red heart particles above both their heads) if they have enough food to make themselves and their partner willing. They enter love mode based on their amount of food and not the population cap, but can produce a baby only if they have their own beds plus an available bed for the baby, and the beds have two empty blocks above them (there needs to be room for the baby to jump on the bed). If the population cap is met,‌[Bedrock Edition  only] or the beds are obstructed, this prevents them from mating, and angry particles appear above their heads (along with the heart particles, note that when this happen, they still use up their food points). Much like with farm animals, when two villagers are in love mode and can see each other, they go to each other and stare for a few seconds, after which a baby villager spawns next to them. Breeding villagers does not drop experience. The baby villager spawns wearing clothing dependent on the biome the village is in (with a small chance to inherit one of its parents' outfits, if different). It acquires a job after it has grown up and if there is a valid, unclaimed job site.

### Willingness
Villagers must be  willing in order to breed. 

Villagers can become willing by having 12 food points, which are gained by consuming food in the villager's inventory. Bread provides 4 points, while carrots, potatoes, and beetroots each provide only 1. Farmer villagers occasionally throw harvested crops at villagers, allowing them to pick them up to obtain enough food to become willing.

Breeding consumes 12 food points.

Villagers do not accept food or farm food themselves if gamerule 'mobgriefing' is set to false. This makes villager breeding possible only with 'mobgriefing' set to true, because villagers cannot become fully willing without food.

In Bedrock Edition, villagers can become willing if the player trades with them. Willingness is granted the first time a new offer is traded, or at a one-in-five chance on subsequent trades. This does not cause them to immediately seek out a mate, however.[verify]

## Curing zombie villagers
See also: Tutorials/Curing a zombie villager

5% of zombies are zombie villagers. Additionally, when a villager is attacked by any zombie they have a chance (50% on Normal difficulty, and 100% on hard) of turning into a zombie villager instead of just being killed.

Players can cure zombie villagers by using a golden apple on them while they are affected by weakness. Players can usually apply weakness by brewing potions. In nether-disabled servers, a witch and a zombie villager, or Weakness tipped arrows from a master fletcher are needed. Witches sometimes throw a splash potion of Weakness if a player is within 3 meters, which players can use to their advantage.

After the player uses the splash potion of Weakness and a golden apple, the zombie makes a loud sizzling sound, emits orange swirly particles, and shakes. During the conversion time (up to 5 minutes), they still behave as zombies, so they should be protected from sunlight and kept away from nearby villagers. After a few minutes, they turn into regular villagers.

A zombie villager who has been cured gives a permanent discount on trades to the curing player.

## Popularity

  

This section describes content that exists only in outdated versions of Java Edition. 
Village popularity was removed in Java Edition 1.14 in favor of per-villager reputation.


A player's popularity starts at zero and ranges between −30 and 30. The following can alter a player's popularity:

A player's popularity does not reset on death, and players cannot alter other players' popularity. Popularity is stored per village; a player's popularity may be high in one village and low in another. When a player acts directly on a villager, particles around that villager indicate the change in popularity. Conversely, because popularity is stored per village, if the entire village is destroyed, any accumulated popularity, positive or negative, is also eliminated.

If a player has -15 popularity or less, the village's naturally-spawned iron golems act hostile to that player until the player's popularity is increased by trading. Golems constructed by the player, however, are always passive toward the player.
Summoning golems, trading, and healing increase popularity.
