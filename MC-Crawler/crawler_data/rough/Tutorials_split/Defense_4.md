#### Players
Arrow turrets are one way to defend yourself against other players.

They consist of any number of dispensers attached to a rapid pulsar redstone alternater. Simply add a lever to the side of the pulsar, and switch it on or off at will. Make sure the dispensers are loaded with something that will damage the players, such as arrows.

A good, fast machine gun requires one sticky piston, four redstone blocks, one slime block, and four dispensers. Place the sticky piston horizontally and the slime block on the head. Take the redstone blocks and place them on the sides, top, and bottom of the slime block, but not the front. Then go one block forward and place your dispensers. Activating the piston causes a redstone update, causing the piston to go to and fro VERY quickly due to quasi-connectivity. It fires off a stack of ammo in less than a minute. Please note that you cannot turn it off, unless you keep it constantly on by placing a torch on the back.

Players with elytra can raid from the sky, making walls useless (unless it's seriously tall). This causes the need for air defenses. As of recent updates, dispensers shoot fireworks in the direction they're facing, instead of just up. One can build a missile launcher this way, using the quasi-connectivity method stated above, or with a rapid pulsar. The fireworks will explode in the aerial attacker's face and hopefully kill them. However, flying attacks makes the defensive area a 3D space, so multiple launchers may be needed in multiple directions. Range can be altered with the firework's flight duration. This can be used for intimidation purposes rather than actually defending.

These will give any player trying to grief, or steal from, one of your structures, a nice shock. This turret is fully automatic, and as long as you have the arrows to support it, it will demolish anything in front of it. Fire charges can also be used if you have the resources. However, these are not recommended if your structure is made out of a flammable material, as it could set it on fire and burn it down. An easier (and lower resource cost) way to make the turrets more damaging is to put a lava curtain in front of them. This will set the arrows passing through on fire so they cause more damage.

### Materially Expensive
The following methods require more materials but are much more effective

#### Creepers
Creepers have an explosion nearly as powerful as TNT, so they can easily blow through a wall made of stone; if this happens, it can break a hole in the wall, so that other uninvited mobs can enter your protected area. The only true wall that will protect against creepers is a wall made of bedrock or obsidian, although the former can only be used on a multiplayer server with item spawning enabled, with a mod, or via creative mode. A self-repairing wall can also be created using a cobblestone generator. Place lava and air alternating and also place waters diagonal to the lava. Note that you have to have the lava as source blocks. See Tutorials/Cobblestone farming for more information about different designs of cobblestone generators.

#### Zombies and Zombified Piglins
Zombies are difficult creatures to face when in a claustrophobic area, such as a cave. They can only attack when they are near you which gives you an advantage and a disadvantage. The advantage is that you can take them from a distance and be safe. However, this method gives the zombified piglins an upper hand when there are multiple of either one and they surround you. This leaves you unable to escape. If building a defensive structure to prioritize against zombies, you should try and stay away from them, but in the case that you cannot make sure you have an open area both inside and outside of your defensive structure such as a courtyard, so that you have alternatives of escape. The best defense from piglins and the zombified versions of them is not to attack them. This is because unless you damage them somehow, they will not attack you.

If you have a supply of villagers, you can make an automatic zombie killing machine. There are many ways to do this but the cheapest and most compact is a 1Ã—1, 3 deep pit. Put the villager in the pit, cover it with netherrack and ignite the netherrack. Zombies will walk towards the villager and get set on fire.

#### Spider jockeys
Create a 1 (or more) block wide hole in your wall and shoot the spider (or attack with your sword). When the spider gets killed, shoot the skeleton. You can also try an arrow dispenser trap instead of shooting them yourself.

#### Slimes
You may defend against slimes by simply creating a long 1 block wide, 2 block tall corridor as an entrance to a walled-off area. Place dispensers loaded with arrows on the bottom row of each side, and any solid block on the top. The floor can be made with any material, but cover it with pressure plates.

The said slime will travel through the corridor, and every time it lands on a pressure plate, it will be struck by two arrows, and if or when it splits, the process will simply repeat itself. To collect the drops, simply remove the pressure plates, stroll on through (reloading as you go if needed) and then when you are done, simply replace the pressure plates on the way out. to help prevent mobs entering while you do this, it may be useful to place a door at the entrance or exit in the wall, so you may close it when you are in the corridor and open it to begin the executions. This also works for most other mobs that will fit through the corridor.

#### Ghasts
There is no particularly expensive way to defend against ghasts. Glass or cobblestone (which ghasts cannot damage) will do just fine, but you could also use an expensive material like iron blocks, or obsidian. However, while glass panes protect you from being noticed and fired on by ghasts, they are shattered in the event a stray fireball explodes near the panes. Glass blocks, on the other hand, do not shatter even when hit directly. To fully ghast-proof a Nether fort, use only glass blocks, and use iron bars or nether brick fences for windows.

Ghasts are easy to kill if you can hit them or reflect their fireball at them. Two well-charged arrows or hits with an iron sword will take one down.
