# Tutorials/Diamonds
Diamonds are one of the most sought-after items in Minecraft, due to their use in crafting diamond and netherite tools, weapons, and armor. Diamonds are also one of the rarest ores in Minecraft along with emeralds, lapis lazuli, and ancient debris. This makes diamonds extremely difficult to find and severely limits a player's supply of diamonds. This tutorial is intended to help players who want to obtain, maintain, and expand their diamond supply.

## Obtaining diamonds

Diamonds can be obtained from diamond ore, a rare find found in about ~0.0846% (~1 in 1200) of blocks in levels 5-16. Diamonds can be found anywhere beneath layer 16, but is most common in layers 5-12 in version 1.17.1 and below; in versions 1.18 and later they are expected to be most common between layers -50 to -64. Most players find it through caving or mining. Most advice seems to suggest using starting at -58 for 1.18 or later and 11 for earlier versions as your starting point.

The player needs an iron, diamond, or netherite pickaxe to mine diamonds (and any gold, emerald, or redstone they find, as well). Although it may be tempting to use stone tools for digging to save the durability of iron tools, remember that diamond ore does not drop diamonds when mined with a wood, stone, or gold pickaxe. Use an iron pickaxe (or better) at these low levels for anything that looks unusual. A pickaxe with the Fortune enchantment increases the average number of diamonds obtained depending on the level, with Fortune III pickaxe harvesting an average of 2.2 (maximum 4) diamonds per ore.

An example of what a player should bring are:

- the rightpickaxe, as mentioned above (bringing 2 or more is a good idea, in case one breaks)
- food
- torchesto help see and also prevent mobs from spawning and some sticks to make more along the way
- awater bucketto convertlavaintoobsidianfor easy traversal and to remove the burning status from falling into lava
- a crafting table to make mineralblocksandfurnaces
- aswordto fight off mobs
- ashovelto removedirtandgravel
- armorto reduce lava and monsterdamage.

Optionally, you can also bring potions of Fire Resistance just in case you accidentally expose yourself to lava.

Players can use a bucket to store lava or from nearby lava pools for some good smelting, but if the bucket contains water, remember to store the water in a hole before starting the smelt. Water Buckets are also good for mining a lava pool.

Diamonds can sometimes be found in naturally-generated chests and structures.

### By spelunking
Spelunking (exploring caves) takes less time and tool-usage than mining, but is more dangerous since there could be monsters within.

To locate diamond ore by caving, simply explore any cave, either by locating surface entrances or digging and working down to level 15 or lower. In Java Edition, pressing F3 (the debug screen) helps check depth. In Bedrock Edition, there is a "show coordinates" game setting that doesn't count as a cheat. It is best to mine at level 11 or 12 because lava beds mainly spawn at level 10. A bucket of water can be useful to stop lava flows. For versions after 1.17.1 for Java Edition and version 1.17.41 for Bedrock Edition, mining in deepslate level (starting from Y=8), especially very deep in the Caves (Y=-40 or deeper) have the best yield of Diamonds, but you must be careful since the deep dark almost always generate at these levels. Avoid any sculk sensors and sculk shriekers (for versions after 1.18.2 for Java and 1.18.32 (1.18.33 for Nintendo Switch players) for Bedrock) as those can spawn the warden after several activations of the shrieker (made by generating noise picked up by the sculk sensors or throwing projectiles at the shrieker). The warden is a very strong mob that tracks you down with hearing and can bring even the best armored players to critical health, and can one shot you if you're at the stage of finding diamonds this way.

Ravines and shafts can provide shortcuts to the depths; creating a waterfall can help players get down and back up safely. Finding underground lava pools is a good indication of the proper depth range, but may not be the best place to find diamonds. Lava may have replaced part of the ore pocket, leaving fewer diamonds to mine.

If a player does see diamond-ore blobs exposed near a lava pool, use a water bucket to convert the surface of the pool into obsidian or cobblestone, then leave the area flooded while mining. That way, if there's more lava under the diamond ore, the water can quench it before the lava can destroy the newly mined diamond(s).

If no diamonds are revealed after spending some time searching, don't give up: diamonds are considered rare for good reason. Search for more caves at similar levels, or switch to the next method: mining or searching for village chests.
