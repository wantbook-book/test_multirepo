#### Collecting excess items
Shears are made for collecting plants like leaves, vines, and grass, but the player should avoid collecting too many, as the extra items consume too many inventory slots. The player should instead collect a number of items slightly above the amount they need for their projects instead of collecting large amounts of items for no reason. It should also be remembered that shears lose durability from breaking blocks, so if the player collected several stacks of leaves and did not know what to do with them, the player would have just wasted two iron ingots which could have been used for something else.

#### Cluttered inventories
This is how big the player's inventory is.
The player has a limited amount of space in their inventory, so they should keep from carrying items they do not need everywhere and can collect more of the items they do need without much hassle. Often, a player who believes there is enough inventory space may find many more important items and have no room for them.

The player should consider organizing their inventory for quick access and perhaps a professional feel to help themselves keep track of what is necessary and what is not. Organizing also helps cut down on the time it takes to find items the player needs or just collected. If the player needs to, they can increase the items they have on hand by using shulker boxes and ender chests, which retain their inventory when picked up. 

In addition to this, the player is recommended to not store items that have no use other than being crafted into something (e.g. iron ingots) or being expended (e.g. arrows) in their hotbar, clogging it with unusable items. During travel, the bundle can be used to store stray items like flowers, seeds or other items that you have in ones or twos but still fill an inventory slot.

#### Disposing of tropical fish items
Tropical fish are pretty much useless apart from restoring one hunger point. Despite this, the player may want to keep some as an emergency food source or for giving to cats and ocelots, and to tempt and breed axolotls. It is best to save any tropical fish you have.

#### 
When they are in its smaller components, they give you more bone meal. Even though the high level of compost is tempting, it doesn't get you anywhere further. For example, using 100 kelp blocks as compost only yields 7.143 bone meal while if crafted into 900 kelp you get 38.571 bone meal, which is more than 5 times as much.

#### Making your base out of the wrong material
Wherever you are, make sure your base cannot be destroyed by endermen (particularly in the warped forest or the End), as they can pick up some blocks, and preferably use strong, blast-resistant materials unless it interferes with the aesthetic that you care about, so that neither creepers nor griefers can blow it up. Lava and lightning both have massive destructive power, so if you don't have a lightning rod and "Fire spreads" is on, try not to use flammable blocks like wood or wool.

#### Using fire charges
If the player has a flint and steel, they should not use fire charges to light casual fires. Fire charges require far more expensive materials to create than flint and steel and unlike flint and steel, each fire charge only has one use. Under normal circumstances, it is not worth wasting those hard-earned fire charges when the player could just use a flint and steel. However, if the player gets trapped in Nether without flint and steel, they can be useful for re-activating the portal, since all their ingredients appear naturally in Nether. (Gunpowder from ghasts, coal from wither skeletons and blaze powder from blaze rods obtained from blazes.) It can also be used for redstone contraptions, such as automatically lighting portals and ranged firebombs.

#### Smelting ores rather than mining them
| Ingredients       | Smelting recipe |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Ore+<br/>Any fuel |                 |

Except for Ancient Debris, ores can only be obtained using the Silk Touch enchantment. The player always gains more experience from mining ores with the correct pickaxe to collect the raw material than from smelting the ore. Additionally, the player misses out on the chance to collect multiple items from each mined ore, especially if they own a pickaxe enchanted with Fortune, or if mining redstone ore or lapis lazuli ore. The only exception is when nether gold ore is smelted, which makes one gold ingot (9 gold nuggets) rather than gold nuggets (2-6 for nether gold ore; average yield does not extend 9 nuggets even with Fortune III).

#### Brewing weakness potions inefficiently
Potion of Weakness can be brewed by adding a fermented spider eye to any of the following potions:

- Water bottle
- Awkward potion
- Thick potion
- Mundane potion
- Potion of Strength
- Potion of Regeneration

By using a water bottle, the player uses the least resources, so using a water bottle is the best option for the player.

#### Wasting healing potions on harming potions
A potion of healing can be brewed into a potion of Harming, but is far too valuable to waste on attempting to harm enemies. This is especially true if the potion is a lingering one, which is much stronger at either tier and far more expensive to brew. Instant Damage heals all undead mobs, including the wither, so the player must never corrupt a healing item in a situation where doing so is counterproductive. In a pinch, it is possible to throw a splash or lingering potion of Healing into a crowd of undead mobs to hurt or kill them and receive the effect if close enough. Lingering potions of both healing and harming at both level I and II inflict their respective effect at half power, but once per second at a total of five seconds, meaning any entity in the cloud receives the effect a total of five times, making such a lingering potion up to 2.5 times more potent than its splash variant. Lingering potions can only be acquired by brewing their respective splash potions with dragon's breath, which can only be obtained at the ender dragon fight, making them extremely expensive. If the player wants to inflict lots of damage on other players or living mobs without damaging the environment with lava or TNT, a potion of poison can also be corrupted into harming with far less wasting of valuable resources.
