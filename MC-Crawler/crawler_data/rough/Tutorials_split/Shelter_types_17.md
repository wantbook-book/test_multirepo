### 
This is regular on creative, but is actually one of the BEST homes in survival. It looks nice and can be a dome if you are skilled it contains a lot of decoration and space. This is a modular home as well so can expand well.

You must make sure to use the base of the dome or cylinder as a walling material and this must be 4-6 blocks high as your lower floor remember to try to sink it into the ground and maybe connect it to a cave for a tunnel/mine. Then, make a walkway with a small hole in the middle to have as a second-floor viewing the water wonders. You can add pistons to part of the lower floor where it's above the ground to exit and do fighting in the water or underwater mining. It also creates lots of clay for you to use and is virtually fully mob-proof as mobs swim so will not be able to attack you and water protects from creepers.

Time to make: Medium dome 2–5 days, large dome 4–7 days, supersized dome 2 weeks, Corridors (40 blocks long) 2–3 days.

### Lava Forts
These are arguably one of the most difficult bases to build, not only because above ground lakes tend to burn wooden homes down, needing a lot of lava as well as the fact that returning home with a stash of diamonds could quite possibly be riskier than hugging a creeper on Hard difficulty. As the player must use non-flammable materials, such as cobblestone, players may not like how the home would look. 
On the other hand, the lava can protect against all types of mobs, allow animal spawns, and is relatively easy to spot from a distance during the night-time from a high perch.

### Ice-Stone Tower
This structure makes an interesting-looking tower, but requires a few resources. First, make a sculpture out of ice (the design is your choice) that is about 3×5×9 blocks. Next, encase it in a structure made from non-flammable materials, with a 1-block gap between the ice and the structure, like this:

Example layer























































Make sure to keep the top open. After the structure is complete, pour lava into the top. After the hissing noises have stopped entirely (3–5 minutes), use a bucket to get rid of the lava, tear down the structure, drain the extra water, and decorate your new house! Glass windows and doors are recommended. Try to get inside without breaking any blocks, only ladders.

### Mountain Bases
These bases are some of the toughest to build because they are basically on top of a mountain. You're probably thinking, "That's easy to build", but it isn't, because it requires a mountain range or at least two mountains. The idea is you link the two mountains together with 10 block wide bridge, and rooms inside the bridge. That's only the start, to make a proper base you could add a floating island around the base and make it better to look at. It's one of the toughest because it requires a lot of stone. It is suggested that you get 200 saplings and plant them around your base as well as in it. When all this is done it will look amazing and easy to protect from mobs because they fall off the edge of the mountain and plummet to their death, but it will take time to build, it takes a lot longer to build than a lava fort, but there is an easy way. If you clear the top of the mountain and make it flat, it will be easier and you can just build a simple house. Of course, this isn't as safe.

### Subterranean Stronghold
This type of base is hard to conquer (see Tutorials/Defeating a stronghold). One first has to find a stronghold in their world (a difficult task as it is), light up the entire structure, patch any holes made by caves, and then make a safe entrance from the surface. You can also use a cave entrance, but this makes it harder to find when coming home after a long day of exploring. You also must be wary of silverfish, and be careful not to break any walls. However, once you do conquer the entire Stronghold, nothing can get to you. The main thing to be wary of are creepers waiting outside your exit, wanting to kill you as you foolishly walk up and out.

Extras

- Windows by your exit are good to have, to stop the above-mentioned creeper attacks.
- Mushroom, wheat, sugar cane, melon, or pumpkin farms for food and miscellaneous items.
- Escape tunnels are must-haves, to get away from anything that could spawn in that dark corner you missed lighting up.
- You can also add a tree farm. This will take quite some time, but you will not really need to go above ground a lot.

### Obsidian Fortress
This will be a home where you shall never fear external damage. A griefer will never block the entrance with obsidian because the whole house is made of it. Best of all, it will be hidden with 2-4 layers of dirt and stone to cover it. This home will require huge amounts of time, space, materials, and hard work, but in the end, you will have everything you'll have ever wanted.

- #x#x# is length, width, and height.

The layout is quite symmetrical except for the entrance. You should find a big hill or mountain to place the entrance. The actual entrance will a 2×1×2 square of stone that will open when the two sideways sticky pistons on either side revert to their normal position. The doors should open on both sides, but the outside switch will be in a 6×1×6 hollow space surrounded by dirt that you will dig through. You then build a 6×25×6 hallway entirely out of obsidian. It should be lit by a torch once every other block on both sides. This will lead to the grand entrance. At the end of the hallway, build an 8×1×8 rim on the blocks in front of where the hallway ended. This will create a big lip around the hallway. Continue building these rims until you finish the 14×1×14 rim. You then pick a corner of the 14×1×14 rim and build another identical rim including the corner of the original 14×1×14 rim. You then build the smaller interior rims just like you did with the first hallway. You'll be going backwards though, so instead of going 8×1×8,10×1×10, etc., you'll be going 12×1×12,10×1×10, etc. until you finish the 6×1×6 rim. Repeat for other two passage entrances until the result is a big square with symmetrical entrances on each side. Put a roof on the big square that is horizontal, not something that sticks out.

- The result of all 6×(#)×6 walls is a 4×(#)×4 space.

For the remaining entrances, build a 6×2×1 floor one block lower than the original floor. Make sure it lines up with the inner 6×1×6 rim. This will be the first of 25 "steps". The ceiling will also be one block lower than the top layer of the rim as well. The ceiling copies the floor, just 6 blocks higher. Make sure walls match the rim as well. Once the 25 steps are finished, repeat at other passageways.

After finishing the stairways, decide what each one leads to. In the main chamber, find the center and make a 4×4×1 square. Make a hole to bedrock with TNT and build whatever you want down there. If safe way down there is not built, please put signs warning yourself and others to not jump in the hole.
