### Hidden wall staircase
This design features a hidden staircase in the wall, revealed by triggering a redstone signal in some way, such as interacting with a lever or button. There are many ways of making this. Look at the following videos for some examples:

### Rapid pit bomber
To make this design, make a dispenser attached to a redstone clock mechanism and hopper to feed it items. In front of the dispenser, place a powered rail on a block of redstone and fill a chest above the hopper with minecart with TNT. This rapidly dispenses those TNT minecarts onto a powered rail and into a massive crater of their own. It can even tunnel down to bedrock given enough carts.

### Programmable item store
This system lets you program what items you want to sell, how many you give, what you want to be paid, and how many of those to be paid. It locks when it's empty. This is a compact system that is also tile-able.

### Two wire control
With a lot of repeaters and AND-gates it is possible to control multiple outputs with only two wires. It can be very tricky to get the timing right. You need a pulse generator in both wires to get a pulse with a defined length and in most cases, the output pulse needs to be made longer. As shown in this video you have a top wire and a bottom wire with repeater. On one side you have repeater between the buttons on the top wire and none (or as needed) in the bottom wire. On the other side none (or as needed) on the top wire and matching repeater (to the other top side) on the bottom one. between which you place AND-gates (matching the buttons). The idea is that the signals meet at one AND gate at the same time.

These "Jeb doors" can also be referred to as flush-inset piston doors. Here is an example of one of these, with a redstone torch key system added on. Once broken down, it's not extremely difficult to build.

This design allows one to get a great view on the surroundings and enables you to connect and stop on any floor you want. The video also contains horizontal piston transport.

This design is even more compact than the previous one; however, it blocks sight. It's great for building elevators in shafts. Note: you need to set the pistons to 3 instead of 2. The first is still to be set on 4.

### Piston Two-Way Elevators
Two-way elevators can be built, but they are slower and much more complex than the previous ones. They also require a lot more space and resources.

The two-way elevator can be built the following way:


The engine shown below of this text uses wool between the pistons and the fence gates/trapdoors. However, instead of wool any other block can be put there, as long as pistons can push it.

The schematics for the wiring assuming that you know how to make a 1 tick long impulse. A 1 tick long impulse can be obtained using a pulse limiter. In both of the schematics, empty squares represent air blocks, and repeaters all have the minimum delay possible.
