## 3-dimensional shapes
3-dimensional shapes are composed of length, width, and height, and are usually made up of either 1 or several 2-dimensional shapes. 3-dimensional shapes are often much more complex than 2-dimensional.

### Pyramid
To make a pyramid, first make a square and build a pillar in the middle to denote the height. Then start at the midpoint of one of the sides and build up by a number of blocks, and after every set of those blocks go in by one or two blocks and repeat until hitting the top. Then repeat on all 4 sides. Then, starting from the top, connect the 4 sides of each level of the pyramid with a square ring. Progress downward, each square bigger than the last, until hitting the bottom. For an even better pyramid, use stairs or slabs to smooth the angle. For a steeper pyramid, use a steeper angle, and vice versa.

### Cone
You can use a similar process as with a pyramid, but with circles instead. Start with a circular base and decrease the size of the circle as you go up. To create a concave or narrowing cone, increase the height of each layer as you rise. For a convex cone, start with thicker layers and decrease the height of each layer.
