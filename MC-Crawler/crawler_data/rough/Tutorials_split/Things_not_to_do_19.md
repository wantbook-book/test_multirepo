#### Smelting cobblestone excessively
Unlike cobblestone, stone and stone bricks cannot be used to make tools, should the need arise. In addition, having to mine stone out again after having smelted it leaves the player without cobblestone, and the player wastes any fuel used to smelt the stone unless it had been mined with a Silk Touch tool. It is always a good idea to keep a decent stock of cobblestone on hand.

#### Carelessness with the dragon egg
Many players want to show off that they killed the ender dragon, but many have lost the dragon egg, which is the trophy of the End, and it is lost forever, because any subsequent dragons do not drop an egg. If the player gets too careless, they may send it back to the Overworld. When collecting the dragon egg, the player should cover up the portal with blocks and use a piston to push the egg, or make it fall onto a torch. Here are some of the things the player should not do:

- Try to mine it
- Forget to cover the portal and send it to the Overworld

Also, never leave it where players can obtain it in a Multiplayer server. There are multiple players, and someone might see it and steal it from the player. The player should place it in a safe place such as an ender chest and only display it if the player is playing with friends or is in eyesight of it.

#### Not using end stone to build on the main end island
If the player wants to build a house in the End, the player should not use anything other than End Stone and Obsidian, lest the Ender Dragon destroy it. End stone is best because it is easy to mine. Obsidian is not recommended, as it takes time to obtain, unless your pickaxe is really good.

#### Using Fire Aspect on an enderman when searching for ender pearls
This is important for people who are purposely hunting for ender pearls. Fire Aspect casts the enderman on fire and make it teleport repeatedly, which means the player might never see that enderman ever again. Also, do not fight them near water, lava, or fire. This makes it easier for them to get distracted and teleport away, as all of those things make endermen teleport away. On the other hand, if the player does not want to fight an enderman and they've accidentally looked at it, they could go into water or rain, stare at the enderman until it leaves, or use Fire Aspect on it.

#### Throwing away emeralds
This is simple theory knowledge. Emerald ore is actually much rarer than diamond ore, and emeralds act as a currency between villager trades and on some Multiplayer servers. There are multiple uses for emeralds such as beacons and villager trading, meaning this item should not be wasted.

#### Using diamonds or netherite as beacon fuel
Beacons require one iron/gold ingot, emerald, diamond, or netherite ingot to activate the beacon. However, it is a bad idea to use rare materials like diamond or netherite. Iron and gold farms are easy to make and emeralds are easily obtained from cheap trades. Use those to save rare materials for other things.

#### Using golden apples on horses
The player should not use golden apples to breed horses, as golden apples are hard to obtain. Instead, using golden carrots to breed horses consumes less gold as a golden carrot costs 8 gold nuggets while a golden apple costs 8 gold ingots. The player should avoid using enchanted golden apples on horses even more since they are uncraftable and can only be found in loot chests.

#### Trading emeralds for obtainable things
The player should never trade emeralds for anything that can be obtained in the near future or would be needed only for a short amount of time, except if they are doing that in order to increase a villager's skill level.

#### Selling large quantities of rare or non-renewable resources to villagers
Some villagers want hard-to-obtain materials, and give you a low number of emeralds. Some of the cheapest trades for obtaining emerald are trading sticks to fletchers, trading crops to farmers, giving rotten flesh to clerics, etc. You should only sell hard-to-obtain materials if you are trying to level up a villager's skill level and you already have a lot of that resource.

Good:

- Sticks: Fletchers buy 32 sticks for an emerald. Therefore, obtaining an emerald is as simple as mining 4 logs and converting them to sticks.
- Carrots and Potatoes: Farmers give you emeralds if you give them crops. If you break carrots or potatoes with a fortune tool, you get more crops. This doesn't apply to wheat or beetroot. Carrots and potatoes are a cheap way to get emeralds. Sweet berries are also available to sell, but only to master level butchers. Once available, they are a good way to get cheap emeralds.
- Pumpkins: Pumpkins can be easily farmed fully automatically allowing the player to obtain emeralds easily once a simple farm is set up. Unlike melons or paper they don't even require crafting.
- Mob drops: Some villagers buy mob drops for emeralds. It is easy to make a mob farm, making these items plentiful.
	- This includes rotten flesh dropped from zombies, as the player usually gets hunger from eating it, it's good to sell it to cleric villagers.
	- Any raw meat, such as beef, porkchop, chicken, mutton, or rabbit can be sold to butcher villagers for emeralds. This is not a big problem if the player has a large animal farm, but it's important not to "cook" the meat by using fire aspect enchanted tools/weapons on the animals.
	- Any raw fish, such as cod and salmon, could be sold to fisherman villagers for emeralds. Like the mob farm, try not to kill any fish with fire aspect, a good and simple way to prevent that is fishing with afishing rod.
	- 
- Glass Panes: Cartographers buy 11 glass panes for an emerald. Glass is easy to obtain, as sand is easily found in a desert, or it can be obtained viawandering traders. However, it is sometimes hard to find wandering traders.
- Stone: Masons buy stone for emeralds. With a silk touch pickaxe emeralds can be obtained easily.
- Wool: Shepherds buy wool for emeralds, in which the player can obtain easily if they have a large sheep/wool farm with different colored sheep for different colored wool.
- Flowers: Shepherds also buy dyes from the player. Most dyes can be easily obtained through flowers, but sometimes the dye isn't easy to get, such as brown dye.

Bad:

- Lava buckets: Armorers buy a lava bucket for an emerald. However, lava is not renewable even in the Nether and buying a bucket from a wandering trader costs 5 emeralds. Also, a bucket is worth more than an emerald. However, as of 1.17, lava is renewable via pointed dripstone and there is a trade loop with the fisherman (emerald to bucket of cod, raw cod to emerald) that lets a player obtain free buckets, making this a good trade (1.17+).
- Diamonds: Blacksmith villagers (the weaponsmith villagers and the toolsmith villagers) buy a diamond for an emerald. However, a diamond is worth a lot more than an emerald. On top of that, it is hard to obtain and not renewable.
- Wheat and beetroot: Farmers buy it for emerald. However, using fortune on these crops yields only 1 wheat or 1 beetroot respectively. Also, wheat is more useful for breeding animals and making bread and hay bales.  However, if you have excess crops, you can use this trade to get a few extra emeralds.
- Coal and iron: Armorers buy 15 coal for an emerald, and 4 iron for an emerald. Weaponsmiths also buy 10 coal for an emerald. Until you have a wither skeleton farm and an iron farm, these items are not good for trading, especially in the early game when you do not have a lot of these resources. The coal can be easy to find underground, which the butcher, fisherman, weaponsmith, and the toolsmith villager also buys for emeralds.
- Gold: Clerics buy 4 gold ingots for an emerald. However, gold is hard to obtain in large quantities. 3 gold ingots are worth much more than an emerald.  However, if you have a large gold farm, such as a bastion piglin-killing farm or a zombified piglin farm, this is not a big problem.
