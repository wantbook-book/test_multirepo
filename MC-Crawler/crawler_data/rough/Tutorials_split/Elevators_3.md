### Breathable water elevator
An expensive water elevator that works well in survival mode.

Requires:

- ActivatedConduit(s)
- Bucket(s)

This elevator is a regular tube elevator attached to conduits.

#### Construction
Build your conduit activation frame in a box of water right next to your tube elevator. Depending on the size and number of tubes, multiple frames may be needed. Add to your conduit or add more conduit frames until you can breathe in your entire elevator.

One rises in water elevators by swimming, going down by falling can drown you in a normal elevator and burn time in a breathable one.

It is dangerous to move between multiple normal elevators without letting your breath meter replenish out of the water. However, conduit elevators can't be built with the current versions of Minecraft.

### Alternate Java water elevator
A water-sign elevator can also be made in a one-block shaft, which is cheaper if making it as a freestanding column. The construction notes are written for survival mode.

Requires:

- Signs
- Bucket(s)
- Infinite water source
- construction block of your choice

Enclose a 1×1 vertical shaft with your construction blocks on all four sides, corners are not needed. 

#### Top-down construction
This method is more useful when building a freestanding elevator up from a floor. One can tower up from the floor, placing blocks on all four sides at each jump on the way up. Then start placing signs and water back down.

Start by placing your safety net on the ground. Make a one-block hole and fill it with a water source. When you fall from high up in the shaft, a single block of water is enough to break your fall so you take no damage.

Once you are at the intended top of your elevator place signs two and four blocks below your feet. You cannot reach down 6 blocks so now you can start with the water sources. Put one on top of each sign, then ready your signs, more full buckets, and jump in. Use the swimming action to stay in the bottom-most water block and place signs further down the shaft, then place another water bucket above this last sign (depending on the size, you may have to keep returning to the top to reload your buckets and repeat until you get down to the bottom).

The last sign can most easily be placed from the opening of the elevator at the bottom of the second block up from the floor. This holds the "entry" water block above the opening in the first block of the shaft proper. It does not matter if you have two water blocks at the bottom of the shaft as players and mobs rise through them fast enough that breathing is not a problem.

#### Bottom-up construction
At the bottom leave a two-block high opening (from the floor) for the entrance. Start placing signs on the opposite wall of the shaft starting with the second block from the ground. Above it place a water source, then jump up into the water and swim upward. Place signs and water sources alternating until you reach the top. The swimming action you need to use to keep on top of the uppermost water block causes you to bob up and down, but some practice makes it easy to work this way.

If you need to have an opening taller than 2 blocks place ladders up the back wall of the shaft to the highest block of the opening. The bottom-most water block then sits on top of the ladder.

Using glass blocks to encase your water elevator gives it a cool look and is useful for monitoring a mob mover.

### Boat elevators



The above design works in Java Edition 1.12+, for earlier versions see below.
Previous Design (Pre 1.12)


This boat launcher / elevator tutorial demonstrates the ability to connect two different bodies of water. This design works automatically; simply ride a boat into the contraption to be launched upward to a max height of 11 blocks. Being simple and compact, this build is similar in concept to real-world water locks used across the world (e.g. the Panama Canal).

The main component of this build is a slime block launcher triggered by a tripwire hook that launches the boat and its rider directly upward to another body of water. Different from other boat elevators, this design uses redstone to launch a boat from one water source into another at a higher elevation, giving the rider a quick and easy form of transportation.

### Honey block elevator
This elevator design takes advantage of the honey block’s hitbox mechanics to make a two-way elevator. In the schematic below, H is honey, S is soul sand, A is air, W is a water source, and B is any other block.

Bottom layer

| a | a | a |  |
|---|---|---|--|
| a | s | a |  |
| a | a | a |  |
|   |   |   |  |


Any layer above the bottom layer

| a | b | a |  |
|---|---|---|--|
| b | w | h |  |
| a | h | a |  |
|   |   |   |  |

To go up, you simply go into the corner of the 2 honey blocks, and because the honey block’s hitbox is slightly smaller than the actual texture itself, when you go into the corner, the player’s hitbox touches the stream of bubbles going up, and you rapidly go up, and to go down, just touch anywhere on the honey block that isn’t in the corner.
