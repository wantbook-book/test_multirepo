## Tips
- By placing lava from weaponsmith shops using a bucket and pouring water over it, you can form obsidian. This way, it is possible to form a portal without ever having a single obsidian block in your inventory. However, you would need to find at least 5 weaponsmiths to have enough lava, so the best way may be to 'mix and match' by using some obsidian blocks and some formed from the aforementioned technique.
- If you place a trail of blocks on your journey from village to village, you'll easily be able to find your way back to previously visited villages.
- It's possible to acquire rare items such asgold,emeraldsanddiamonds, and other precious items by trading wheat to villagers. Get all the wheat you can for trading resources.
- If you have difficulty finding a certain resource, remember, you can usually buy some from a villager. This is especially useful for acquiring diamondswords,toolsandarmor, as well asRedstone.
- Some resources can only be obtained byWandering Traderssuch as: Moss, Dripleaves, Saplings, Cactus and sugarcane.
- If you want a superflat world that has a lot more structures then create the world in 1.17 then update to 1.18.2 then update to 1.19 or higher to have pillager outposts, strongholds, and ruined portals.
- To prevent the slimes from spawning just cover the entire area your not using in water this will prevent all mob spawning though so be careful. Another method to remove slimes is to use some mods to see theSlime chunksand mob proof the slime chunks.

## Extreme challenge
Main article: Tutorials/Flat survival
The Extreme Challenge is the superflat survival challenge without enabling the generated structures option. This is the identical situation to survival in a Flat world in Bedrock Edition. It's still possible to survive with this condition.

** Notes **
- Lava and obsidian cannot be acquired in this challenge, makingthe Netherinaccessible. Also, you cannot make a cobblestone generator, which means no furnace and no smelting. However, there are other ways to obtain stone tools and cooked food.
- Expect frequent deaths, because obtaining any equipment requires a lot of time and patience.
- If you play onJava Edition, note that versions after 1.14.2 removed the spawning of vindicators during patrols, but it is possible to obtain emeralds from villagers you cure.

This extreme challenge is the only available choice for flat survival in Bedrock Edition, because no structures generate in the flat world type in this edition. If you play on Bedrock Edition, just create a world, because the game forces the player to spawn in creative mode. Activate cheats, and remember to only use commands once, just for changing your gamemode to survival, otherwise, it won't be an extreme challenge.

If you play on Java Edition, just create a world with survival mode, generated structures off, and "Classic Flat" preset.

Make sure to enable the "Bonus Chest". Your bonus chest should have a minimum of 2 apples, and either a sapling or 4 planks (or 1 log) to make a crafting table. Without the bonus chest, it is impossible to obtain emeralds and future saplings.

It is possible to create a village by accomplishing a difficult sequence of goals:

- Kill enough zombies to get enough iron to craft a cauldron and a bucket, kill witches until you get a bottle.
- Wait for the cauldron to fill with rain, get the water from it, place the water, use the bottle to refill the cauldron; then you can make an infinite water source.
- Use water to drown zombies; kill the drowned to get copper ingots to make a lightning rod.
- Collect or breed pigs around the lightning rod, wait for lightning to strike to turn them into zombified piglins, which you kill for gold ingots (about 200 zombified piglins are needed to get enough gold for two golden apples).
- Craft golden apples and use them to cure two zombie villagers you have trapped in a boat by contriving to get a witch to throw a potion of Weakness at the zombie villager.
- Breed the villagers after you get two of them.
