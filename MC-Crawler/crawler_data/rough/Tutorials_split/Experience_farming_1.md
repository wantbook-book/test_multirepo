## Mob grinder
Mob grinders are typically built high up in the skies so constructing them is a bit risky, as there's a high chance of dying unless you have boots enchanted with Feather Falling III or IV and you're good at doing MLG's. Go for mob grinders if you haven't located a spawner yet and if you want access to different types of loot.

## Spawner XP farm
Spawner XP farms are typically not that great for XP as it requires about 24 minutes of grinding just to get to Level 30, but in the case of a zombie spawner, this duration is compensated by enchanted loot that you get. A blaze spawner though is worthwhile because you can use the blaze rods for blaze powder to brew potions, craft ender chests or use the blaze rods as a consistent source of fuel, as one blaze rod can smelt up to 12 items.

## Quartz mining
Quartz mining is arguably one of the easiest ways to get XP early game. However, they fall off at late game if you mined all the quartz in the area and had to explore more areas to mine more quartz. 

## Enderman XP farm
An enderman XP farm is a great source of XP. You can typically get to 30 levels in just under a minute. The biggest downside however, is the fact that you need to build this at y= 1 (to increase the rates) in the End Dimension, thus it has a high risks of dying in the void and losing your stuff.

## Gold XP farm
Gold XP farms have multiple designs but they all have the same mechanics, in Java Edition, most gold farms use magma blocks as a spawning platform, the killing mechanics depend on the farm design itself. Some designs make the zombified piglins fall into a hole to easily kill them, some use turtle eggs to lure them instead, some manually hit them to go to a killing chamber and so on. In Bedrock Edition however, most farm designs utilize obsidian portals that is continuously destroyed and lit up to spawn zombified piglins, which are then transported to a killing chamber for easy XP. Aside XP, the farm is also an infinite source of gold and thus you can use the gold to barter with piglins, craft golden apples or make a golden pyramid to power the beacon.

This farm is one of the best in collecting XP because of the bonus gold. You can get up to Level 100 in one hour depending on the design. 

## Guardian farm
A guardian farm is one of the fastest ways to get high XP. However, you'd need to dedicate a lot of time draining an entire ocean monument and a lot of spawn-proofing to get the maximum rates possible. Guardian farms are still worth the try, as aside XP, you can get a new set of beautiful building blocks.

## Smelters
An automatic smelter can be fed with the harvest from any of several automatic crop farms, and the resulting experience claimed when you need it.  

There are a limited number of useful crops here, basically the ones that can be automatically farmed:

- Kelpgives little experience (6.4 XP/stack), but the smelted kelp can be turned intofuelfor the smelter, with a surplus for other uses.
- Potatoesgive more experience (22.4 XP/stack); the cooked potatoes make a solid mid-tier food supply, and they can be composted for more bonemeal than the raw potatoes.
	- Chickens are also an option, as they can be automatically bred and killed to produce a stream of chicken meat, but for any given number of chickens, more experience can be had by manually slaughtering them.  That said, having large numbers of chicks around waiting to grow up can also cause a lot of lag for the game, while a continuously running farm (which kills but does not cook the chickens) can get by with fewer chickens alive at any one time.
- Cactusgives far more experience (64 XP/stack), but unlike the others it cannot be cooked in a smoker, and the resulting dye has no use beyond making things green.  For a large-scale smelting setup, arrangements must be made to dispose of the dye.

For large smelter farms, the load can be divided among several furnaces, which can be harvested separately; list allows storing larger amounts of experience without needing to harvest it all at once, and also allows faster progress (so long as the input farm can keep up).  For a simple single-furnace setup, nearly two stacks of cactus (120 items) can be burned in a Minecraft day,  collecting 360 XP per real-time hour.  Potatoes and kelp burn twice as fast, but give less experience, yielding respectively 252 and 72  XP/hour.  Of course, maintaining this rate for long periods of time requires an input farm large enough to supply 120 or 240 items per day, and this is multiplied for multi-furnace setups.

Fuel can be provided by the player in quantity, but it is even possible to fuel the farm with an automatic bamboo farm, or with an automatic charcoal smelter, perhaps fed by a tree farm.  An automatic charcoal smelter can smelt 7 stacks of material for each stack of wood provided to it; dried kelp blocks are more efficient at 20 input stacks per kelp-block stack (11, if we discount the kelp blocks used to smelt more kelp), but they do require manual crafting to produce.  A bamboo farm must be large enough to provide four stacks of bamboo for each stack of material to be smelted.

If continuous fueling is not practical, it is possible to set the intended yield of the farm by the amount of fuel loaded into it — for example, a cactus smelter loaded with 70 kelp blocks produces enough experience to bring a player from level 0 to level 30 — with a single furnace, this takes most of four real-time hours (3h 52.5m).  This is significantly slower than fishing, but where fishing requires the player's presence, the smelters can be left to operate on their own (in any loaded chunks).
