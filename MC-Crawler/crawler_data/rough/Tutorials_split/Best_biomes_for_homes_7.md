#### Cons
- No wood naturally spawns in the ice spike biome. This is a horrible place for a beginner to build a house because there is no wood, meaning the only way you can successfully live in the biome is if there is a biome with wood nearby that you can harvest wood from.
- The ice spike biome is extremely difficult to farm in. Because the biome is so cold, water freezes unless protected. This means that you must do extra work to build your farm inside your house or underground. Because of this, no natural sunlight would be there to boost the crop's growth, meaning that you would have to go through extra trouble to provide illumination.
- Biomes that are hot or medium/lush are usually not found near ice spikes, which means that it's harder to gather resources if living in an ice spikes biome.
- There are practically no passive mobs in this biome (aside from occasionalrabbitsorpolar bears), which, coupled with the total lack of plants, as if things weren't bad enough, makes it ever so harder to obtain food.
- Strays can spawn here.

#### Useful resources
Packed ice, ice, snow, polar bears, and rabbits are useful resources found in ice spikes biomes.

### Mushroom fields
Despite this biome being far down on the list, it is actually one of the easiest biomes to live in. However, Mushroom fields are rare, and rarely connected to the "mainland" in any way. The most common reason for players to look for a mushroom fields biome, is the fact that no monsters (except the phantom) naturally spawn here, although monster spawners still spawn mobs. It is completely safe for new players, and still great for experienced players. The one mob that does spawn there, mooshrooms, can be "milked" with a bowl to get mushroom stew or with a bucket to get milk, allowing for an infinite food source as long as the player has a bowl. The mycelium is useful for growing mushrooms, and with the exception of the swampâ€Œ[Bedrock Edition  only] and dark forest biomes, this is the only biome containing giant mushrooms. Normal monster spawning cannot happen at all, meaning that gunpowder is unobtainable but the drops of zombies, spiders, and skeletons are available from monster spawners, additionally mineshafts still generate and can spawn cave spiders. Trees also don't spawn here, meaning that wood is unavailable unless you find a shipwreck on the mushroom field shore or you bring wood from a nearby island. Make sure to bring saplings with you if you decide to build your house on a mushroom island, if you don't have saplings, wandering traders can still spawn in this biome and may sell saplings, make sure to have emeralds, which you can get from shipwrecks and mineshaft chests, to buy it.

#### Pros
- Mycelium, on which you can plant mushrooms independently of the light level, likepodzol. Contrary to podzol, though, the mycelium spreads like grass, making it easier to obtain in large quantities.
- Red mooshroomsspawn here, and give a reliable infinite food source, as long as you have bowls in stock.
	- InJavaandBedrockeditions, when mooshrooms breed, they have a small chance to spawn asbrown mooshrooms, which if milked after being fed by flowers gives yoususpicious stewthat can inflict you with status effects depending on the flower used. Red mooshrooms also transform into brown mooshrooms when struck by lightning and vice versa. If you shear a red mooshroom, it drops a few mushrooms and turn into a normal cow.
- Small and large mushrooms, both types(red and brown), spawn here, allowing for more mushroom collecting and using themushroom blockas a building material (if you have aSilk Touchshovel).
- No hostile mobs spawn within this biome, which means an overall safer experience.
- Offers an interesting aesthetic to build structures surrounded by huge mushrooms and mooshrooms.

#### Cons
- Aside from mooshrooms, no other passive mobs spawn which makes obtaining food harder. Although, you can just milk the mooshrooms, which may or may not be enough food.
- No natural light-based mob spawning means creating a mob farm without a spawner is impossible or without transporting animals and breeding them. This means the only way to obtain drops such asbones,string(to craftbows), orarrows(for use in bows) is to build out over the ocean.
	- Alternatively, if you have a composter, you can convert mushroom into bone meal.
	- Make sure to have loads of emeralds aswandering tradertrades are useful in these biomes.
- The lack ofwood, which means no first set of tools orcrafting tableor anything crafted withcobblestoneor wood. No wood also means nobowls, which makes obtainingmushroom stewharder.
	- The only wood source is fromshipwreckswhich can generate on land in mushroom field shore, although they are quite rare.
- Rarely connected to any other land, and if you spawned here for the first time, going to the mainland risks your hunger bar depleting from swimming. You can't make aboateither, because wood is not available in mushroom fields. Unless you somehow swim to the mainland, the biome is connected to other non-ocean biomes (very rare), or you find a shipwreck, wood is inaccessible.
- If you spawn here, you must swim back (or go back) to the mainland (which can sometimes be thousands of blocks away), find a shipwreck, or go into the middle of the sea to fight patrols to get emeralds to buy saplings in order to get wood. If the mainland is too far away, you should consider creating another world.
- The whole island is covered inmycelium, which makes it's not a good place for big builds.

#### Useful resources
Mycelium, mushrooms, mushroom stew, milk, suspicious stew, planks from shipwrecks, loot from dungeon, mineshaft chest and buried treasure in mushroom field shore are useful resources found in mushroom fields biomes.
