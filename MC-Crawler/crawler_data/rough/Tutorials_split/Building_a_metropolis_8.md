#### S - U
- SchoolHave a school to teach players about building, mining, crafting, brewing, enchanting, farming, fighting, andredstone. Make a building (size depends on the kind of school â€” for instance, an elementary school would be small (20-50 blocks), while a college would be much, much bigger (150 to 300 blocks) and fill it with desks, chests with textbooks in them, a teacher's desk. You can have all kinds of rooms at school. For example:
	- Classrooms: Where your students come to learn. You can teach Science, Social Studies, Arts and Crafts, Magic, etc. Put desks, chairs, a teacher's desk, chests with textbooks (written books), and a blackboard, or use thechalkboardif you're inMinecraft Education). Perhaps the teacher could have a stock ofsignsand could use them to 'write' on the board, by putting the signs on it and typing the information.
	- Detention: If students are naughty or break the rules, they go to detention! Detention can be anything, from sitting there thinking about what you've done to extra homework. If the students are exceedingly naughty, they could get suspended or even expelled!
	- Cafeteria: After many long school hours, this is where the kids can go to grab some grub. You may have a menu. Maybe the kids need to spend "lunch money" for lunch, food may be free, or the students may bring their own lunches. Make sure no poisonous food gets in.
	- Nurse's office: If your students are injured or ill, send them here! The nurse may be able to help!. Be sure to utilise potions, milk and food.
	- Halls: Finally, the halls. It may be a simple hallway, or it might be a big, bustling corridor. Don't forget lockers! An example of a locker isiron blocksin the shape of a rectangle with aniron doorandchestsinside to lighten your load.

- Science labBuild a place to testpotionsand create new inventions. Don't forget those safety goggles!

- SewersMake sewers underground that link all the houses and buildings. You can have the sewers flow into a sewage treatment plant, unless you are building a medieval city, so the filthy water can be cleaned. Usemossy cobblestoneormossy stone bricksas walls and add awaterstream. Don't forget to light it, as otherwise, the sewers become a dungeon. You could also use the sewers as a secret way of transportation and hide entrances in important buildings.

- SiloBuild a large warehouse-like building and addladdersandchestsfor you to store the output from factories and it can double as a store of waste to be taken to incinerators or a contraband destruction facility.

- Ski hillBuild paths down mountains and hills. Different paths can appear to have different difficulties based off of the hill incline, bumps, and turns. Spruce trees, chairlifts, ramps, cabins, and snowmen would all make great decorations for the trail.

- SkyscraperBuild an incredibly tall building out of gray or brown blocks and have lots of windows. You can add a piston elevator that allows players to choose which floor to visit. If you are building your city insuperflat, you can build extremely tall skyscrapers. Make a floor plan, which include thins such as shopping centres, offices, apartments, hotels,or something related to leisure activities such as an observatory.

You can add mechanical floors at intervals which includes something like a control room that controls theredstonesignal in the building.
SlaughterhouseBuild a medium-sized building where unwanted animals are lined up todrownor burn (not withlavathough) or whatever suits you. Collect their drops and give them to meat and/orwoolshops. Note: Do not build this if your city is a Peaceful Place.
- Space stationYou could build a place either on the ground or just under the build limit, or in theEnd, You could use aTNTcannon facing upward to propel you to infinity and beyond! Remember to have a ground control and all the other stuff. You could build a fake moon out ofend stoneor normal stones and addslimesas aliens. Make it futuristic and have lots ofredstone. You could build two: one in space and one on the ground. You need to hire astronauts. Build a 'rocket' to explore the universe.

- StadiumHave a big stadium where players can compete in sports such as spleef and paintball. Add lots of seating for people can sit and watch.

- Surveillance room/security officeGet somebody to explore the whole city with a large map. Then, put the map in anitem frame, and you can see where other players are! Tip: Hide this room.

- Suspension bridgeBuild a large suspension bridge across the river. Build towers out ofiron blocksand usewoolto make main cables and usefencesas vertical cables. You can use most expensive blocks likediamond blocks,gold blocksandemerald blocks.

- Tattoo shopA place where you can change your skin. (Note: Only possible in Bedrock Edition.)

- TP hub:Use Command Blocks with the /tp [coordinates] command to make a TP Hub for fast travel. A cheap alternative to making a massiveminecartrailway system.

- Train station (life size)If you want to build a train station with the trains about the size of real-world ones and not minecarts, this can help. Make sure the trains are big enough so players can walk around in them but not so big it seems off (train carriages 5-6 blocks wide is probably the best option). For a small station, you can just build platforms alongside the tracks (make sure they're far enough away so the train doesn't appear to scrape it), sheltered benches, a vending machine, a wheelchair ramp, a small single-level parking lot, and an automatic ticket machine. If you want, the tracks the platforms are next to can be sidings so trains not stopping at the station can pass by. For large stations, feel free to take inspiration from large stations in the real world (eg; Chicago Union Station or New York Grand Central Station). Be sure to add lots of tracks and platforms (maybe with a large dome covering them all), fast-food restaurants, small stores, escalators, elevators, a ticket counter, bathrooms, a hub outside on the road for buses/trams and taxis, and a large, maybe stacked, parking lot.

- Tropical islandA perfect vacation spot which only needs a boat dock or bridge to the mainland. Decorations can add to the feeling of vacationing with tropical trees and beaches filled with tourist items.

- TV studioGives people something to do such as filming soap operas or winning rewards on a game show. Hire directors, producers, actors and actresses, build TV show sets, have ratings etc. This could provide a lot of fun for players on a server.

- Upgrade shopA place where people can upgrade their tools or armor for a price that depends on what level of armor you're upgrading from.
