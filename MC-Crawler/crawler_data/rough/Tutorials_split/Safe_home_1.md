### Creepers
Widely considered to be the most dangerous mob(except the bosses) in Minecraft is the creeper, because of the damage it causes to buildings (they can effectively blow large holes in your structures). However, you are safe within your base if there are creepers outside, as they can't get close enough to you to explode. You might even be able to open your door and kill the creeper with a bow and arrows, as long as you keep your distance!

Also, be aware that creepers can detect you and start their fuse from one block away, even if there is a low wall or fence keeping them away. Ways to avoid this are: build a wall at least two full blocks tall (even if it is made of certain translucent blocks such as slabs, fence or glass); or build your home with all spawning surfaces on all traversable paths sufficiently lit.

Different blocks have different resistances to explosions. Dirt walls will be easily destroyed by creepers, while two block thick cobblestone will resist most creeper explosions. Obsidian is explosion-proof with the exception of blue wither skulls, so you can laugh in the face of creepers trying to destroy walls built of this block.

Cats are also a good defense, as creepers will run away if they are in a short distance of one. Even if you've attacked the creeper, it will run away as long as there is a cat nearby, so it is a good idea to put cats around your base.

### Spiders
Spiders can jump 3 blocks, therefore 4 block wide ditches with over hangs won't protect you against spiders/spider jockeys.
Spiders are two blocks wide, which means they cannot move through 1-block wide spaces. Spiders can also climb walls and fences, so you won’t be safe in your walled garden anymore.

To effectively spider-proof your buildings, you’ll have to do one of these things:

1. Build a lipped wall (a wall with overhang, mostly at the top.andare common wall-top profiles). This lip can have 1-block wide gaps in it, since spiders require a 2 block wide space to climb. An especially effective spider deterrent is making said lip out of burning netherrack.
2. Fences can also work as a wall-top and have the advantage of being able to easily look down to see the wall itself—handy for making sure nothing is at the door before leaving. The wall must be at least two high to prevent spiders, though this is true of regular cobblestone wall-tops as well.
3. Completely cover it with a roof.
4. Dump buckets of lava around your castle.
5. Build your buildings underground. As long as the entrance to the underground building is only 1 block wide and/or completely enclosed with trapdoors, no Spiders will be able to get in. A top view example:.


You can keep spiders from climbing walls using glass panes/iron bars to create an edge. example: 
|  |  |  |

|  |  |  |

Spiders can climb cactus fences, but they will suffer some hit damage doing so. Therefore, cactus fences only reduce the chances and speed of a spider climbing walls. Either make multiple fences or one fence tall enough to kill any spider that climbs all of them. Each fence only needs to be one row of cacti, because while cacti can’t be placed next to each other, spiders are two blocks wide. Use the method in the General section for a version which works on other mobs too. (If you prefer a wall for keeping off all other mobs, you can use this cactus fence: 
|  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |

### Skeletons
Skeletons are dangerous because they can fire arrows through gaps in your defenses. Wherever possible, fill open gaps with any of certain translucent blocks such as slabs, fence, or glass to make windows.

Additionally, build low walls or fences in places where you may be in the range of a skeleton since they will only fire arrows at you if they can see you.

### Spider Jockeys
Spider jockeys are dangerous because of combining the climbing and tracking abilities of Spiders with the ranged attacks of Skeletons. You must combine your defensive strategies for both skeletons and spiders.
They're relatively rare, so it is unlikely, but not impossible, to encounter more than one Spider Jockey on the same night.

### Zombies
Zombies are the simplest mob to defend against. With limited mobility and no ranged attacks, walls or pits will be enough to keep them at bay. However, zombies can break down wooden doors to reach you if you're in Hard difficulty. If you're in Hard, you can make a piston door so that zombies cannot get through, or you may make an iron door. Zombies very strongly prefer to smash the top half of a door, but can't jump and smash a door at the same time (jumping resets their progress smashing the door), so putting a 1-deep hole in front of your door should prevent zombies from breaking down the door while still allowing mobs (such as yourself) to enter when the door is open. To prevent other mobs from using the entrance put a two high pillar of sand above the door, though this won't stop or even hurt the offending zombie. A way to prevent zombies from breaking your doors is to put the doors in sideways, rendering them "open" when you close them. Or you could make an iron door with a button on each side. Zombies can break down wooden doors and not iron doors. Zombies will not jump over gaps, so you can use lava trenches. If you are starting/low on Iron, you can use a fence gate or place the Wooden door parallel to either side of the doorway (when you close the door, zombies will think it is open). 

You can also use traps such as pits, landmines, etc.
