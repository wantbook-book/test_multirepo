## Location with cheats
In Bedrock Edition, the /locate structure temple command Creative mode (or Survival with cheats enabled) does not distinguish between the four types of temple; the command locates whichever is nearest, no matter what kind of temple it is. It can be a desert temple, jungle temple, a witch hut, or igloo. If you are in one of the biomes where a temple can spawn, there is a better chance that the temple located is one that belongs to that biome.

In Java Edition, each temple type has its own separate /locate commands. The commands are case-sensitive.

- Desert pyramid -/locate structure desert_pyramid
- Jungle pyramid -/locate structure jungle_pyramid
- Igloo -/locate structure igloo
- Witch hut -/locate structure swamp_hut

## Desert pyramid

To find a desert pyramid, you can either look above ground, or search while mining.
If you are underground and you run into a large, square formation of sandstone, it is a desert pyramid.

There is also a tool that can find desert pyramids for you, in case you don't want to search them yourself.

When attempting to enter the hidden chamber, the player must take care not to step on the pressure plate at the bottom of the pit, as the plate is connected to 9 blocks of TNT just under the hidden chamber's sandstone floor. The pressure plate is situated directly under the blue terracotta. The TNT explosion is sufficient to kill most players (and may even destroy the player's drops), as well as destroy all four of the chests, including their loot.

To avoid the trap, you can dig out one of the blocks orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to the center block, and reach the chamber by any of conventional methods. Or, if reached from below, it is possible just to mine the way into the chamber.

To see better in the treasure room, it is actually best to destroy the blue terracotta in the upper chamber first. During the day, the light from the sun shines down into the room, reaching into the treasure room if the terracotta is removed. If you are on a multiplayer server, you can rig up the chests to the TNT to get the better of an experienced player.

There are a number of ways one can get down into the treasure room:

- Build a staircase spiraling downward along the walls.
- Dig out the blue terracotta and use a water bucket to get down.
- Dig vertically below your feet to descend, digging a vertical channel down one wall. After ransacking the room, step back into the vertical channel, and, using the blocks you collected on the way down, jump into the air while placing one of the blocks below you. In this way you can ascend back up the wall.
- Dig a hole in one of the corners, drop in sand blocks until the pillar of sand reaches the top, then use a shovel to dig out the sand below you. Gravel works, too. You can then use the same sand to climb out by looking straight down, jumping, and placing the block beneath you.
- Just jump straight down. This is fastest, costing you about 12× 6health points, so you can survive the fall. Powdered snow is recommended, but don't use a water bucket because the water can push you onto the pressure plate.

After reaching the bottom, your first act should be to mine the pressure plate in the center to avoid accidentally triggering an explosion. Don't forget to dig out the TNT after raiding the chests, because they can be useful later.
