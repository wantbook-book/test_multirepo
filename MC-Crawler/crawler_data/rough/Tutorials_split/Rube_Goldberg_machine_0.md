# Tutorials/Rube Goldberg machine
A complex redstone device might not be every miner's cup of tea, but a giant chain reaction device can be a quite entertaining thing to build and test, and players can learn a lot from it. On this page are some ideas and tips that could make the machine one to be noticed.

## Ideas
### Mobs
Some mobs attract or repel certain other mobs. Villagers attract zombies, zombies attract iron golems, cats repel creepers, and skeletons attract wolves. Show off mob pathfinding by making a small maze with a trapped mob at the end. Near the end, make the mob step on a pressure plate, tripwire, or have the mob die. You can have multiple mobs for a race.

### Item flow
Droppers can be used to shoot items over ice that has water on top. Make an item slide onto a pressure plate that triggers another dropper to shoot more in a different direction. You can also use anvils to crush a mob, and make its drops fall into a hopper, with a redstone comparator next to it.

### Water-torch
Removing the pink wool causes the water to create a path for itself using the torches and sand.
Water can knock out torches. Use a water device that knocks out a torch supporting sand/gravel, making it fall 2 blocks. This continues the water flow.

### Cannonstone
Sand and gravel cannons could be used to shoot a block over to an area that has a powered repeater with a piece of redstone dust missing. Once the block falls in place, the redstone circuit is electrified and conducts power. The player could also shoot mobs using pistons and slime blocks.


### Greenstone
Greenstone wire
A neat type of wiring can be made with cactus, sand and torches. Place a cactus, add sand on top, add a torch in the sand, and place sand on the torch. Right next to where the sand falls, add another cactus. Rinse and repeat.

This works because cactus cannot be directly next to a solid block, and breaks itself if a block ends up next to it. The sand is supported by a torch, which is supported by more sand on top of that cactus. When the cactus breaks, the sand is no longer supported and falls next to another cactus.


### Sandclock
Piston is not sticky.
A piston pushing a solid, gravity affected block (gravel or both sands) over a hole, with a powered repeater on one side of the sand's destination, before it falls and a line of repeaters on the other side can make some short pulses, and if a lot of the block is used can be used to unlock certain circuits. The powered repeater that transmits power though sand/gravel could be replaced with an observer block.


###

Knightwise variation of pistone
Redstone blocks are a source of power. To make "Pistone", make a piston push a redstone block into the rear end of another piston that pushes a redstone block into another piston. Also, players could place a piston where the redstone block originally was, so when the piston pushes it, piston 2 unpowers. The player could make it a sticky piston that pulls a powered block away from another piston.

Players could also replace the redstone blocks with opaque blocks with a redstone torch below, or opaque blocks that a gap between a powered repeater and the next piston. Slime blocks may also be used.

### 
Make a dispenser shoot an arrow, snowball, egg, splash potion, or anything else that is shot as a projectile when put in a powered dispenser at a painting or item frame. This knocks it off. You can use this by making it fall onto a wooden pressure plate or into a hopper with a comparator next to it, or by having a comparator behind the block the frame is on, which removes the signal, if you have the comparator pointing into some redstone dust on top of a block with a redstone torch on the side, the torch powers back on. Or, you could simply use a target block, but this doesn't look as cool. Any way you do this sends a redstone signal to the next part of the contraption.
