### Bed
Place a bed before sunset and go to sleep as early as possible to prevent monsters from spawning. Keep away from caves, as they supply no protection.

### Instant shelter
Instant shelters are the absolute basic, and while they keep you safe, you lack many luxuries and abilities.
These shelters are useful when exploring a map or finding rare resources like clay or cacti. They are meant to be built in 5 to 10 seconds, anywhere on the Overworld or in a cave.

There are 2 types of instant shelters you can doÂ :

The first one is simply a hole in the ground.
This is exactly what it sounds like. All you need is to dig a hole according to the schematics below.



| Ingredients                 | Crafting recipe | Description                                         |

This design protects you from mobs even if you build the shelter at midnight. You should stay careful when going out of it, as a mob may fall into your hole. If there are any mobs on top of your hole, you might not be able to sleep due to them being too close. If you do not place a torch inside to light the shelter, it will be dark enough for a mob to spawn.


The second type of instant shelter is a pillar on which you can sleep. This method will only work if there are no mobs nearby.

This shelter is useful if you don't want to be surprised on your wake by mobs and see the sun (you can clean the area around with a bow and an arrow). However, building a pillar without overhangs is not advisable since spiders can climb the pillar. This is easily circumvented by making overhangs on top of the pillar to prevent spiders from climbing up the pillar and harming the player sleeping in bed.

### 
There is another instant shelter that is easy to make; all you need is 1 red mushroom, some bonemeal, 1 block of ground, 12 blocks of choice, a torch or two, and 1 bed.

First plant your red mushroom on a dirt block, then use your bonemeal on that mushroom. Remove the central stalk to make it easier to maneuver. Fill the area between the edges of the mushroom and the ground with your blocks of choice, place a torch or two, place your bed, and you've finished your makeshift base. Some people like to think of it as a tent. It also has the plus side of producing even more mushrooms to make food. As of Java Edition 1.2.4, you need to plant the mushroom on Mycelium to build the shelter unless the mushroom can't see the sun.

If you dig a 1-block hole in the ground to plant the mushroom in, it will usually (but not always) grow its walls all the way to the ground.

Brown mushrooms can also be used as a safe place to snipe mobs from with the bow and arrows.

### Basic hut
It's just what it sounds like. It's a ground level structure that can be a bit bigger than the Instant Shelter. Just place your bed and build a space around it that mobs cannot penetrate.

### Mountainside hut
This is built on a mountainside for maximum protection. Simply dig into a cliff, hill, or mountainside enough to fit a bed and room to wake up without danger of suffocation.

### Tree house
This might be one of the most efficient, and safest, ways of making a one-night shelter. All you do is go up in a tree and barricade yourself with any material. This works especially well with larger trees (the ones with branches). Note that spiders may be able to get up the smaller trees. Also, a plus-side to this shelter is that you have a natural way to see outside.

With the use of jungle trees, you can make a really high tree house or even make a tree village in a jungle biome connecting each tree via a walkway/bridge. However, making an entire village is not the easiest thing to do when you have to keep on moving.

### Cave dwelling
If you happen to have a pickaxe with you, this is an easy one. If you stumble upon a cave, you only have to barricade the entrance and you're done. Of course, barricading the side of the cave that leads into the earth is also a good idea, since lots of hostile mobs might spawn. Like always, proper lighting is a must-have.

### Forest Roof Shelter
Go on to the leaves on top of a Dark Forest and build your shelter there. Be careful: mobs cannot spawn on leaves, but they can climb there!

### Dirt Tower
This peculiar structure allows sunlight in while keeping the mobs out. Basic design:

Since spiders can sneak through the cracks and endermen can pick up dirt, it is advised you build your temporary dwelling out of cobblestone or something of the like, with 1 block wide openings.

NOTE: Baby Zombies can still get into your holes. Baby Zombies are not good for your health. Nor are Cave Spiders, which can fit in small holes.

The overhang keeps spiders out.
