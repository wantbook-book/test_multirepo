Fish Tank








Place the stairs upside down, and facing out the way the ice is. The player can also build an actual fish tank with using glass (not panes, as water will flow through them) and fish buckets. First, build a box out of glass, and then fill it with the fish buckets and buckets of water. It is possible to add some seagrass, kelp, or sea pickles for decoration, or even coral blocks if the tank is large enough. A larger tank can be used to hold squid and, if it has an open top, dolphins, but will be quite hard to create in survival. A tank holding guardians is also possible, but should be only done in Creative, as guardians are extremely hostile towards players. Squid should never be held in the same tank as guardians, as guardians will attack them, eventually resulting in the squid's death. Silverfish, despite their name, are not fish, and will drown if placed in a fish tank.

## Architectural styles
Another easy way to make a building or group of buildings look nice is to build them according to real-world styles. The style will determine the shape of your building, the material, and possibly the location as well.

### Medieval
One of the most used architectural styles in Minecraft, comes from Europe and Britain in the period between 476 and 1500. The "Medieval" period of European history is roughly the time between the fall of the Roman Empire, and the appearance of modern-style nations. The used materials are usually wood and stone, but stained glass and roofs with varying colors (prismarine, amethyst, and colored concrete can work well) can add a more fantastic touch.

### Colonial
These types of houses were first built during American Colonial times (1600-1700 roughly) using either brick or wood, depending on what was plentiful in the area. Massachusetts has a lot of good clay, so brick is popular. Farther north you might see more wooden constructions. Real-life wooden houses can be made just about any color with paint (in-game can be a little trickier), although red, white, yellow, and blue are common. The house type is fairly simple, as it is a rectangular prism with a few windows and add-ons basically. These could look good in a player-made town in a forest biome.

### Victorian
This style came over from England with the influx of European settlers used between 1840 and about 1900. The mainstay of the time period, most buildings were made out of mass-produced brick and looked very similar. A good example of Victorian Architecture is the row houses outside many British cites during the industrial revolution. This type of architecture was very bland looking with very symmetrical design. This style looks good on flat terrain and built around large brick factories.

### Brutalism
This build style, starting in 1950s England and spreading over the next two or three decades usually involves visually heavy edifices with geometric lines, solid concrete frames (indeed, a lot of exposed concrete in general), exaggerated slabs, double height ceilings, massive forbidding walls, and a predominantly monochrome palette, brutalist buildings prioritized function over form, and stripped-back minimalism over flashy design. In Minecraft, most building materials consist of concrete or stone as well as iron, glass, or wooden blocks. Brutalism tends to produce either iconic builds or eyesore builds.

### Modern
This contemporary style is based largely on the availability of more modern building materials such as pre-stressed concrete and other composites. It can feature many different colors, layouts, and building materials, but the materials allow for more open spaces and larger windows. Normally, houses are made up of rectangles all fitted together with many windows present. Try quartz or glass.

### Futuristic
This style, inspired by the ambitions of late-20th century science fiction, includes sleek-looking, space age buildings, and often includes spacecraft. In the real world, buildings can be more fanciful, with structures that seem impractical (and often would have been, with older materials). In-game, large expanses of glass blocks are often used, with concrete and terracotta as other main materials. This style usually has a lighter color scheme. Especially appropriate for The End, where it can be used for making space stations.
