#### Multiplayer
On multiplayer, the Plains biome has both some heavy pros and some heavy cons. It is easy to build defenses due to the flat terrain, and it is hard to be ambushed when at your base. However, the base (if at surface level) is easy to see. This means that enemy players/scouts could find a way in. If you settle in a plains biome, it is recommended that you make some tall walls to keep enemies away. Alternatively, you could build above or below a pillager outpost, and the pillagers would act as a natural defense. Before settling in a plains biome for a long time, you should gather a substantial amount of wood from the nearest trees so that you don't have to go back and forth between your base and a forest.

### Desert
Many players prefer to not live in deserts, as they lack grass, wood, and many other vital resources. However, once a player has basic materials, living in a desert can be beneficial. Sand can be obtained in large quantities, and cactus is rare in other biomes. Almost no above-ground water generates here, which poses a problem if spawned deep within these biomes. Also, no passive mobs spawn here other than rabbits. No trees spawn here either. Though not the best biome for the beginner, it is still a nice biome to live in after you've got your initial house set up somewhere else (see Tutorials/Survival in an infinite desert for tips on how to survive in a desert).

#### Pros
- Large open spaces, allowing plenty of room for building.
- Desert pyramidsspawn here, which contain decent loot inside the treasure chests.
- Desert villages spawn here.
	- Village temples have chests, which can be looted.
	- Desert villages are the only place where pig, sheep, and cow can be found in this biome.
- The terrain is generally flat, apart from the hilly variants.
- Rain does not obscure your vision from potential dangers like mobs. It also means no thunderstorms causing any trouble.
- Lots ofcactusanddead bushes.
- Lots ofsandmeans you can get lots ofsandstone,TNTandglass. Sand and sandstone are quite rare in other biomes.
- The bright sand can make it easier to see in the dark, and the mobs that come with it.
- Undead mobs have a harder time trying to find shade during the day with the lack of foliage.
- Rabbitsspawn here, which offer food since the desert doesn't naturally spawn other animals.
- Fossils spawn underground in this biome like the swampland biome, which can be a good source ofbone meal.
- Pillager outposts can generate here, which supply a large amount of dark oak log and birch planks in the desert, and the occasional iron golem. However, the pillagers are quite a challenge if the player has not yet obtained wood.

#### Cons
- There is little water which causes difficulty in many water-related activities, especially farming. However, villages and desert wells can be good sources of desert water.
- The lack of rain also means you can't boost the time of fishing, and you can't hydrate crops if the desert is lacking any water sources.
- No grass.
- No reliable way to naturally get a lot of wood.
- Sand can suffocate you if it falls on you while mining near the surface.
- Like the plains, you can get shot down by skeletons due to the lack of foliage shielding its shots.
- Husks, a variant of zombies, makes up 80%‌[Java Edition  only]/70%‌[BE  only]of zombies found there. They give theHungereffect when hit. Also, husks do not burn in daylight, and can therefore be dangerous to players who have trouble during mob fights, or to villagers in desert villages.

#### Useful resources
Sand, cactus, dead bushes, sticks, sandstone, sugar cane, rabbits, villages, loot from pillager outposts.

#### Tips
- Spawning in a desert is a rough time. For newer players, it is recommended to wander to another biome as staying here means accepting a great challenge when it comes to survival.
- Coming to the desert to mass-collect the sand in bulk is a good idea if you need glass or sandstone.
- If you find a desert and expect to need sand in the future, set up a base somewhere more habitable and come back later.

### Meadows
Meadows are similar to plains biomes, though they usually generate at the bases of mountains, at higher elevations. They are unique from plains biomes in that they spawn donkeys more frequently, as well as having unique flowers.

#### Pros
- The meadow is a particularly peaceful biome, and its higher elevation means it can allow for nice views if the player builds near a hillside.
- Villages can generate in this biome, being identical to plains villages.
- Being a sub-biome to Mountains, emeralds spawn underground in meadows.

#### Cons
- Trees are sparse here, similar to the plains biome. Getting wood from elsewhere may be required.
- Many animals do not spawn in this biome; only donkeys, sheep, and rabbits are available here.
- While villages can generate in this biome, pillager outposts can too. Be wary of nearby Illagers when building a base.

#### Useful resources
Donkeys, various flowers, emeralds, plains village loot, pillager outpost loot.

### Windswept hills
The Windswept Hills biome is perhaps one of the more spectacular biomes, with peaks and stone cliffs, but also one of the more difficult to navigate. Large surface caves, floating islands, and overhangs are often found. Snow falls above y-level 95, allowing for snow farms and ice farms in this biome. 

#### Pros
- The hills in this biome can have scenic views.
- Emerald oresare scattered underground, providing a helpful start fortradingwithwandering tradersif the player cannot find a village. There is also quite a bit of exposedcoal oreand stone.
- One of the better biomes to farm ice and snow. The farm must be built over y=95, but most mountains reach far beyond that height.
- Exposed stone makes it easier for beginning players to obtain it, in turn making it easier to upgrade both gear and building materials.
- Lavacan be found without having to go down deep into a cavern. Lava pools commonly spawn on the surface, allowing for easy construction of things that require it (cobblestone generators,nether portals, chicken farms, etc.).
- It is easy to find and harvestcoal, which means logs do not need to be used ascharcoal.
- Zombie villagersspawn here wearing unique clothes and can be cured into snowy villagers.
- The biome gives plenty of high vantage points, useful on servers and forPvP.
- Iron ore is sometimes exposed, allowing for easy access to iron gear without having to enter a cave.
