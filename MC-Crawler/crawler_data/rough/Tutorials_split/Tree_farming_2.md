## Farming various types of trees
### Simple farming
What players need:

1. At least 4 saplings of any kind
2. A chest for storage (optional)
3. An axe of any type to speed up the job (optional)

First dig 1 block down. Count 4 blocks to the left and dig 1 block down. 4 blocks left again, dig one down. Repeat one more time. Then plant a sapling in every hole:

Wait a day (or use bone meal), then harvest the trees and get the saplings. Place the chest nearby to store the saplings (and axe, if players have one) in there. Then, you can extend the grid if you like, as long as all the saplings are the same type. (Mixing types can work, but the timing and space requirements get a bit messier.) You can add a torch in the middle to make the saplings able to grow at night and also ward off some mobs.

### Giant tree farming

Spruce and jungle trees can be planted and grown just like any other tree. But unless you only need a small amount of wood quickly, this is not useful. Not only are regular jungle trees slightly too large to harvest easily, but the jungle trees drop saplings rarely, and may not even replace the one used to grow them.

However, four saplings can be grown into the respective "giant spruce" and "jungle giant" forms, by planting them in a 2×2 formation:

Aside from the saplings, make sure there are no blocks less than 2 blocks away from the saplings (even torches), at any height up to the future height of the tree trunk (up to 32 blocks). A huge tree needs a 2×2 thick trunk to grow. These trees average ~96 wood (1½ stacks), and some can exceed 2 stacks. Bone meal can be used on any one of the saplings to make the tree grow more quickly. (Dark Oak must be planted similarly, but they don't grow tall enough to require the special harvesting techniques.)

- Especially if breaking the leaves on the spot, this can be most of aMinecraftday's work. Plan ahead—you may want to wait out the night 10 or 15 blocks up atop the trunk. Every so often, go back down to the ground to collect fallen wood and saplings—if you try to leave them until you've finished, some of the first logs and saplings reach their 5-minute expiration. The fastest way to harvest a giant tree is with a diamond axe andshearsor an iron hoe.
- If you're using stone axes, bring a spare, because axes get used up quickly. With wood axes, bring at least four of them to be safe. Likewise for your shears or hoe.

Harvesting trees is a bit harder, since the trees are really tall. You can do with a top-down technique or with a spiral-up technique.

- Top down: get up and cut down. Less thinking needed and more efficient for fast (enchanted diamond or netherite) axes.
	- Getting up:
		- For jungle giants, you can use those shears to harvest vines from two or three sides of the trunk to complete a track to the top, breaking or shearing the upper leaves.
		- For giant spruces or if you can't be bothered with the vines, you can just bring a half-stack of ladders. If you do need ladders, but haven't got them, you can take a block or few of wood in a column (that is, a groove up the trunk), use those to make some ladders, and run the ladders up the groove, making more ladders as needed and as you mine the tree. You might need to make a crafting table with the first block.
	- When you reach the top, find one block of wood standing above the other three. Chop that to start the canopy decaying.
		- For jungle giants, it's best to stand on the trunk and clear all foliage above your foot level, then use the remaining leaves as a floor to get at branches and the edges of foliage. Go down level by level like this until you've got all the branches—watch for knots of foliage that aren't decaying even though they're separated from the trunk.
		- For spruce trees, it usually suffices to cut away the foliage from the trunk (as far below your level as you can reach), to speed decay.
	- When you've got all the branches for a jungle giant, or immediately for a giant spruce, you can simply cut your way down the trunk.
- Spiral up: cut a staircase out of the tree. No extra tools needed. As fast as top-down for normal axes.
	- Start by cutting three bottom blocks (height 1,2,3) out of the right (or left) side the tree. Go inside the space you just created, cut up three higher blocks (height 2,3,4) on the neighboring part. Go up that block, turn left (or right), and repeat (height 3,4,5) until you make it to the top.
	- Now make you way down by going down four stairs, chopping away what is above you, and repeat. If you have see a branch, cut that down first, using the leaves as a floor.
	- When you are on the ground, just finish up the little stump you have left.

If you want to be able to pause your work or are just afraid of heights, you can put a block of water around the dirt blocks where tree sapings sit on. If you are working with spruce trees, increase the depth to two blocks in case leaves grow over them.
