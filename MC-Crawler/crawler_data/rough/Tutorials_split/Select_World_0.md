## Java Edition
The "Select World" menu in Java Edition.
When clicking "Singleplayer" on the title screen, the player is brought to this menu if at least one world exists. If no worlds exist, the player is directly brought to the Create New World menu.

A search bar exists above the screen, allowing the player to find any world with a search.

Each world is listed along with some information about the world, such as world name, game mode, and cheats.

When opened by clicking the "Singleplayer" button with Space, the worlds that are incompatible with the current version or were last played in a snapshot version aren't displayed.
