### Cast and Molding
Casting and molding are slightly different than other methods. 
For molding, one uses dirt or cobblestone or another cheap, non-flammable material to fill in all the blocks they want hollow. Then, they fill it in with lava wait for it to settle, cover the source block, cover in water, and, lastly, break the dirt. 

Casting means one fills layer by layer with lava source blocks and pours water over them, turning it into obsidian. It is very difficult as one needs a diamond pickaxe for mistakes and large amounts of buckets for effective transport of water and/or lava, not to mention the high danger of working with lava. For a large amount of lava needed, it is advisable to either find one or more lava lakes or to go to the Nether. (more to come)

For something new, try lava on a tree, then just add water when it seems right to you.

### Nether House
This is basically any type of house built in the Nether. It is highly recommended that you make it out of a blast-resistant block, such as cobblestone or nether brick. If you don't have much resources, use some warped stems, crimson stems, and/or blackstone.

## Landmarks
### Mountain Marking
A simple way to mark a spot, if it is next a mountain‌[Java Edition  only] or extreme-hills‌[Bedrock Edition  only] biome, is to put some torches on the top. You can also add lava on them.

### Statue
Statues, especially big ones, can be used to indicate a certain spot.

Materials needed

- Cobblestoneorstone. They are a preferred building material, but any block, for examplewool,planks, orblocks of goldcan be used as well.
- Optionally,glassblocks or panes.
- Signs. Again, it is optional, but it may be used to tell which statue is which if you want to build many statues.

1. Start by making the base of your statue. 10×10 should do.
2. Place the blocks to make up the figure you want. It can be from creepers to slimes, from busts to full-sized, be creative in making your statues!
3. Mark the statue with asign. Again, it is optional.

### Light Beacon
Beacons/Pillars can be used to mark the location of a house/structure.

Materials needed:

- 4 torches, a bucket of lava, 5 blocks of glowstone, and 4 blocks of glass
- Lots of sand/dirt, etc.
- 2 buckets of water
- Some good food (if you get damage, although this is optional, you can make it on peaceful)

1. Start by making a pool of water that is 3 blocks deep (make sure it's 2 blocks away from your pillar).
2. Use the dirt/sand etc. and use the "pillar jumping" method to continually make a pillar up to the cloud level. You now have the pillar.
3. Now for the light. Start by putting the four torches one block lower than the topmost block, then change the topmost block with glowstone, and put the four remaining ones around it. Put glass above the four blocks and put the lava in the middle.
4. Then jump into the water (don't worry- the water stops fall damage) and there you have it, your own light beacon.

You could also use a beacon block, but these are expensive to make and cannot be crafted early in the game.

### Navigational Towers and Lighthouses
Navigational towers and lighthouses can be created to help you find your way home after a trip to say, the beach. You'll need enough of some kind of block to make a tower of your desired height, a light source, and enough ladders to climb that tower.

1. Start by using thepillar jumpingmethod to create a tower, it is recommended that you use a more stable material, such ascobblestone. This tower should be built to your desired tower height. Feel free to add a balcony around you, but make sure to leave a hole where you can climb up. If desired, you can addglowstone, atorch, aredstone torch, or ajack o'Lanternto the top, otherwise this can be accomplished later.
2. Fall off the side of your tower. As you fall, stick against the tower, and placeladdersright below you. If you're not worried about the damage, you can choose to simply fall off, and then place ladders as you climb up to reach the top. If there is water nearby, it's recommended to jump into deeper water.
3. You should now be able to access the tower with ease. If you didn't do so already, place some sort of light source (Glowstoneis preferable if you have some) at the top.
4. Other, more complicated options, are Redstone torch blinkers, or even clocks that are attached tonote blocks.

A navigational tower, or lighthouse, made with cobblestone and lit with torches.
### Lava Pillar
Another useful landmark tool is a lava pillar. Though slightly more costly than a lighthouse, it can be spotted much more easily, during the day or night. To build one, you need one bucket of lava, and enough materials to build one pillar of your desired height.

1. Dig a 3×3×1 square in the ground. Ensure that the square is walled on all sides.
2. Build a pillar right outside the grid (two blocks away from the center). This one should be made out of a weak and preferably collapsible material such as sand.
3. Once you have reached the desired height, build a two-block-long walkway directly over the center of the pit.
4. Go back to the pillar and destroy the single connecting block between the block over the center and the pillar.
5. From the pillar, step as far back as you can and place your lava on top of the center block. Then destroy the outer pillar. Bear in mind, this could result in you being set on fire if you touch the lava.
6. You now have a 3×3 column of lava that spans the height of your pillar. Because the lava falls into the 3×3×1 hole you dug in step one, it won't flow outwards, risking damage. If you still feel unsafe, feel free to build walls of glass around the pillar.
