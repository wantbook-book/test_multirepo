### Crystal PVP
Crystal PVP is using End Crystals and Respawn Anchors to defeat your opponent. End Crystals and Respawn anchors are capable of one-shotting players in full Prot IV netherite armor, and so it is generally regarded as the most powerful form of PVP. Many survival servers ban or disable these items, and even on those that do, getting large quantities of crystals and anchors can be time consuming and expensive.

- 
	- Gearing Up
		- At least a stack of obsidian, end crystals, respawn anchors, and glowstone blocks as your main weapons.
		- Bring as many totems of undying as you can since they will be your main method of staying alive.
		- A piercing or multishot crossbow with arrows tipped with slow falling to make it harder for your opponent to seek the low ground.
		- 2+ stacks of Bottles o' Enchanting in order to heal your armor with the Mending enchantment.
		- Instead of Proection IV on your leggings, Blast Protection IV is preferred in Crystal PVP. You can always have a Protection IV leggings in your inventory or ender chest as a back-up in case you find yourself in a sword fight situation.
	- Items and Mechanics
		- End Crystal: End Crystals can be placed on top of obsidian or bedrock blocks by right clicking obsidian with the end crystal. Any damage will explode an end crystal, causing it to deal damage that can be blocked by a shield. End Crystal damage is vastly higher if your legs are on the same or higher Y level than the end crystal. It's also not possible to place an end crystal if its hitbox would conflict with another entity hitbox such as another player or dropped item.
		- Respawn Anchor: Respawn Anchors can be placed in the overworld or end and then charged with 1-4 glowstone blocks (charge has no impact on damage). Once charged they can be set off by right clicking them, dealing damage in the same fashion as an end crystal and creating a large, fiery crater.
	- Strategy:Crystal PVP is all about being lower than your opponent and setting off your explosives so that they damage them far more than they damage you.
		- Ledge Crystal: Running off of a ledge that you and your opponent were both on, putting down an obsidian and spamming crystals into the obsidian.
		- Hit Crystal: Hitting your opponent, then placing an obsidian and spamming crystals into the obsidian while they are in the air. It's best to use a sword enchanted with Knockback 1 to hit your opponent.
		- Safe Anchor: Placing a respawn anchor in front of you and any block in between you and the anchor. That will shield your legs from the damage of the explosion, but still harm your opponent.
		- Blocking Off: If there is a block of obsidian under or around you where you might get crystalled, it's a good idea to quickly cover it up with other blocks so that end crystals can't be placed on the obsidian.
		- Double Tap: Hit your opponent with a sword then immediately place an obsidian and blow up a crystal. Then, right when your opponent stops flashing red, blow up a second crystal to double-pop your opponent. This instantly kills any player holding only 1 totem. However, this requires strategic timing as the second crystal cannot be too late or too early.
		- Double Handing: Essentially, this means holding 2 totems to avoid dying to a double-pop. You can have a slot in your hotbar for a totem and bind a hotkey to that slot. Right when you feel like you are going to get popped, switch your main hand to that hotbar totem by pressing the hotkey.
		- Pearl Flash/Abuse: After you pearl, you will have a damage tick, during which your opponents cannot deal knockback to you. By exploiting this, you can avoid getting hit by your opponent. This can be used both as a defenive mechanism, or you can use it to instantly perform a hit crystal on your opponent. If your opponent face-places, remember to pearl directly at your feet to not get caught in the crystal.
		- Face Placing: Place an obsidian right in front of you and spam crystals. This is to counter pearl flashing as crystals can catch your opponent's incoming pearl, which usually throws them off (sometimes it can straight up pop them).
		- Retoteming and Inventory Management: When you get popped, you will need to restock the popped totem either in your hotbar or offhand. This requires you to go into your inventory and quickly hover your mouse over a totem, then immediately press the offhand key or hotbar totem key to put the totem in the corresponding slot. (For example, if your switch to offhand is binded to "F", hover over a totem and press F; if your hotbar slot for the hotbar totem is binded to "V", hover over a totem and press V). To make this process as fast and accurate as possible, you should put all your totems around the center of your inventory, which requires good inventory management. When you are having difficulty retoteming due to them being to far from the center, you can disengage from the fight temporarily to fix your inventory.
		- Hit Crystal (Advanced): As previously mentioned, you can combine pearl flashing and hit crystal to instantly perform an attack on your opponent. To achieve this, first step is to aim your pearl at your opponent's feet then throw it. Then, immediately start spam clicking while your crosshair is facing the general direction of your opponent. This allows you to instantly hit your opponent up in the air right when your pearl lands next to them and perform a hit crystal/double tap instantly.

## Organized PvP


### Structures
** Standard base **
A base made of cobblestone with several chests and beds for allies.

** Heavy base **
A base made of 3 layers of cobblestone and about 50 beds and over 100-150 chests. Recommended to have a tree farm.

** Hidden base **
Very small, but easily camouflageable. Do not make this base more than 15 blocks wide, or it will lose its ability to hide. Cave or jungle biomes are your best bet for making this base. To hide its identity more, add leaves and other natural resources around it. You could even add portal entrances to the base, so baddies cannot infiltrate inside the base from outside.

** Factory **
Not really a base, but produces resources and holds some player. Has about 50 beds and tons of chests. As the name suggests, this is where you get most supplies, but make sure your other bases have mini factories too. Have tree farms, ranches, mob grinders, experience farms, crops, cobblestone generators, and stockpiles. Have people who run it, and people who defend it. Make sure to add minecart rails and tunnels to transport supplies and people from the factory to the bases. A self destruct machine is helpful to avoid it falling into enemy hands. Make sure it has farms to produce food, potions/nether wart, iron and other minerals, and wood and stone!

** Destroyer **
A huge sky base with 200 beds, 200 chests and made of stone bricks with people monitoring the outside with dispenser turrets and other advanced weaponry. The only way for it to be destroyed fast would be lots of TNT. If you wish to mass-produce these, you really should build a cobblestone farm.

** Battlecruiser **
A medium-sized sky base with enough space for 100 troops and lots of storage and requires lots of cobblestone.

** Turret **
A redstone turret with a redstone clock and a rapid fire redstone gun that shoots about 3 arrows/second. Recommended for the guns to be high and blocked off.

** Cobble farm **
Recommended to mass-produce everything above. Creates cobblestone with lava and water.

** Local Brewery **
Made of about 3 layers of cobble, with creeper and witch farms (or just a lot of chests with these materials in them) and dispenser guns. Make sure to have about 10 brewing stands and people operating them, with about 20-30 beds and chests. Put splash potions of harming, poison, and weakness in the guns, hook up a redstone clock and watch the fireworks.

** Item stash **
An items stash is a small (no more than 4×4×2), completely camouflaged room with a few double chests loaded with equipment. Because they rely on not being detected, their locations should be only known to trusted members. The ideal location to build one is underground but in a location where no-body would dig. For example, near but not in a surface cave since the player trying to mine would just go down the cave. 

** Redstone house **
This house is the trap of them all! Make the house look inviting, iron blocks behind the glass, chests everywhere, and maybe a sign that was "supposed" to be to a friend for a secret entrance. They walk in the door, see the chests, and open them, only the chests are trapped chests! When they are activated, you can have them shoot arrows, lava, or even TNT! Make sure to add a piston that blocks the door when the chest is opened too!
