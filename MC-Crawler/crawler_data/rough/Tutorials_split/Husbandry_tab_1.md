## Best Friends Forever
Tame an animal

Requirements: Tame a tameable mob.

Tame one of the 10 tamable mobs in the game: parrot, cat, wolf, horse, skeleton horse, zombie horse, donkey, mule, llama or trader llama.

- Parrots spawn injungles. They can be tamed byusingthem with any type ofseeds.
- Cats spawn invillages. They can be tamed withraw codorraw salmon.
- Wolves spawn naturally inforests,taigas,old growth taigas,snowy taigasandgroves. They can be tamed withbones. Beware that if you accidentally attack an untamed wolf, it and its whole pack will start attacking you, similarly tozombified piglins.
- Horses and donkeys spawn inplains,savannasand their variants. Horses can also spawn in villages, and donkeys can spawn inmeadows.Mulesare obtained frombreedinga horse and a donkey. To tame a horse, donkey or mule keepusingthem withan empty hand. The first few times they may buck you off, but eventually, they will let you stay on and heart particles will appear. This means that you have tamed them successfully.
- Llamas spawn in savanna andwindswept hills. Two trader llamas spawn leashed to awandering trader. Similarly to horse-like mobs, to tame a llama, keepusingthem withan empty handuntil heart particles appear. With a trader llama, it must be unleashed first.
- Skeleton horses and zombie horses cannot be tamed normally, but using/ride, they can be tamed just like a regular horse.

Once you have tamed one of these mobs, you will be rewarded the advancement. Naturally spawned skeleton horses and camels do not count as they are already tamed.

Make the text of a sign glow

Requirements: Use a glow ink sac on a sign

First, you need a glow ink sac. These drop only from glow squids, which spawn in water below Y=30 in light level 0. As ocean biomes very rarely reach this depth, you should probably look in underground aquifers. At least one glow ink sac always drops when a glow squid dies.

Next, craft either a normal sign or a hanging sign:

| Name         | Ingredients                                                                                | Crafting recipe |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Sign         | MatchingPlanks+<br/>Stick                                                                  | 33333333333     |
| Hanging Sign | Chain+<br/>MatchingStripped Logor<br/>Block of Stripped Bambooor<br/>MatchingStripped Stem | 66666666666     |

Signs also naturally generate in igloo basements and taiga villages.

Place the sign down and write any text on it. Then use a glow ink sac on the written sign. You will then be granted the advancement.

## Fishy Business
Catch a fish

Requirements: Use a fishing rod and catch a fish.

First, you need to get a fishing rod. You can craft it like so:

| Ingredients       | Crafting recipe |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Stick+<br/>String |                 |

You can also find these in ocean ruins chests, from a drowned drop, or buy from a Fisherman villager.

Now find a body of water and throw the bobber in the water (use the rod for that). Bubbles will appear next to the bobber, indicating that something is in the water. Once the bobber dips in the water, quickly reel it in. To get the advancement, you need to catch a fish, not treasure/junk items (you can only catch treasure loot by fishing in open waters). If you didn't get a fish, try again. More information can be found on the fishing page.

There is also a quicker way of getting this advancement: kill any fish, drop the item you got (either raw cod, raw salmon, tropical fish or pufferfish) and pull it with a fishing rod. This can be done even on land.

## Total Beelocation
Move a Bee Nest, with 3 bees inside, using Silk Touch

First, you need to find a bee nest (see Bee Our Guest above). You will also need any tool enchanted with Silk Touch, although axes are the fastest.

At night or during rain, all bees from a given nest go back to it for a rest. All naturally generated bee nests have three bees inside at the beginning, but they may get lost on the way back to their nest or get killed. Thus, there is no guarantee that a given nest still has all of its original bees inside. Sadly there is also no way to check it without commands.

When you break the bee nest with a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, it will drop as an item, with the bees still inside it, and the bees will not be angry at you. If you don't break it with Silk Touch, the nest will drop nothing, and the bees will be angry. You must break the nest quickly, otherwise the bees can escape before you break it. Once you break the nest, you should get the advancement; if you didn't get it, this means that the nest didn't have all 3 bees inside and you must attempt the advancement with another one.

Catch a tadpole in a Bucket

Requirements: Use a water bucket to catch a tadpole.

First, find either a swamp or a mangrove swamp, as these are the only two biomes where frogs spawn. You will also need a water bucket and at least two slimeballs. These drop from slimes, which also spawn in swamps, but only at night. Slime spawning in swamp biomes also depends on the phase of the moon; the closer it is to full moon, the more slimes will spawn. At new moon, no slimes spawn at all.

Use a slimeball on two frogs to breed them. Frogs breed differently to most mobs: instead of a baby frog appearing, one of the frogs lays frogspawn on a water block nearby. You can't pick this block up even with Silk Touch, so you must wait until it hatches: this takes 10 minutes. When time has passed, 2-5 tadpoles will spawn in place of the frogspawn block. Use your water bucket on one of the tadpoles. This will catch it in the bucket and grant you the advancement.
