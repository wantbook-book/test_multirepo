# Controls
Minecraft offers controls tailored for different input methods.  While Java Edition is playable only with a keyboard and mouse, Bedrock Edition has a wider variety of control schemes in order to accommodate players across all platforms. These controls can be changed in the options menu.

## Java Edition
### Non-configurable controls
Note: On many laptops and most Mac computers, "Function keys" (briefly "F-keys") do not operate in their default configuration. The player can often get around this by pressing the Fn key or sometimes the ⇧ Shift key while they press an F-key. To make F-keys work in macOS, go to the Apple menu → System Preferences → Keyboard and mouse and check the "Use F1, F2 etc. as normal keys." If the player choose the first option, they can then use the Fn key to switch F-keys back to actions they used to do (e.g. play/pause music, etc.). The player can also use the F-keys by holding the Option button while pressing them.

Java Edition uses a combination of the mouse and keyboard for controls, generically known as "mouselook/keymove." Many prior games (such as DOOM and Quake) have used such a scheme, but those who have not played such a game before may need practice to get around effectively. Creative mode or Peaceful difficulty in Survival mode are helpful for a player to gain familiarity with the controls.
