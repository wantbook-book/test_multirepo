# Tutorials/Transportation methods
Transporting items, mobs, and yourself long distances is an important but tiresome task. Thankfully, there are many ways to make the trips easier and faster.

## Player transport
Walking or running everywhere are viable options, but you may want a faster or smoother option, possibly with added storage benefits. Below are options for transporting player(s) in order of the effort required to construct them.

### Horses
Horses can be found in plains and savanna biomes, and can be tamed by mounting them until they produce heart particles. A saddle is required in order to control the horse, and it can be equipped with tiered horse armor (Both saddles and horse armor are found in various generated structures). Horses have variable colors and stats, with running speed, jump height, and health all being randomized for each wild horse. A horse that spawns with high stats in all categories makes a useful, tough mount for traversing rough terrain. 

Donkeys uncommonly spawn under the same conditions as horses, with the unique ability to be equipped with chests instead of horse armor. This allows for early game, 15-slot mobile storage. However, donkeys spawn with less desirable maximum stats than horses. Fortunately, donkeys and horses can be bred to produce mules, which share the chest ability of donkeys with stats more resembling horses.  

### Llamas
Llamas, which spawn in mountains and savannahs, are notable for their ability to form a convoy if a llama is being lead by the player. However, since llamas cannot be controlled when mounted by any means, they serve better as item transportation in singleplayer (As they can be equipped with chests, with the amount they can carry being a randomly generated stat). However, if the player is playing with other users, they could ride on the llamas while one player leads.

### Elytra
The Elytra are late-game items found in the End that can be equipped in the chest piece slot. While falling, the player can double-tap the jump button to activate the elytra, allowing the player to gradually glide long distances. This by itself is a powerful transportation method, but the player can enhance their flying with the use of firework rockets to propel themselves in any direction, allowing for extended flight time. However, the player must take note of the elytra's durability, which gradually decreases while flying (The Unbreaking enchantment can be added to slow this effect, and Mending can be added to exchange gathered XP for durability). Phantom membranes can be used to repair elytra in an anvil if necessary. Having a sustainable amount of firework rockets is also fairly expensive if the player does not have a mob farm to easily produce gunpowder. There is also the possibility of the player dying of fall damage if the elytra's durability runs out, or from smacking into a surface at high speeds.




### Minecarts
Minecarts allow the player to be transported along rails with no input from the player, with the downside of having to create rail systems to any desired destinations. It can also be quite expensive to create longer rail lines, especially if powered rails are being used. See tutorials for minecart-related redstone contraptions to automate launching, create minecart dispensers, and more.

### Boats and ice roads
Surprisingly, one of the fastest transportation methods in the game involves a boat on solid ground. When boats are on any variant of ice blocks, they can be controlled as easily as if they were in water, and can travel at immense speeds thanks to the slippery nature of the ice. The speed of the boat can also be adjusted depending on which variant of ice is used; normal ice is the slowest, with packed ice being in the middle, and blue ice being the fastest option. However, this is possibly the most resource and time demanding method in the game, as the player needs huge amounts of ice, blocks to keep the boat on track, and other materials if the player chooses to decorate the track. Additionally, colliding with mobs can be a considerable hazard, especially hostile ones.

## Item transport
Transporting items is essential for players who have advanced to the point of having more items than they know what to do with, whether it is for moving items around your base autonomously or moving items across vast distances.

- Long range options

These options are better for moving items across long distances, such as from one home to another.
