#### 
A compact four-way engine that is controlled by applying a redstone torch to the central observer.

Materials: 13 Observers, 26 slime blocks, 8 sticky pistons, 8 regular pistons. For use: redstone torch, immovable block
Dimensions: 7x5, 4 high (or alternately 5x5x5)
Build guide:
1. Start with the central two slime blocks of layers 2 and 3. The lower of these needs to be at least two blocks above "the ground" -- that is, the highest ground you intend to fly over.
2. Place the upper sticky pistons outward, then use those to place the lower ones facing inward.
3. Add the downward facing observer on the top of this, then the four-high slime pillars outside the pistons, extending above and below them. Use those to place the downward-facing observers on layer 1.
4. Extend the slime pillars into T shapes, at the top on two opposing sides, on the bottom for the other two. (this diagram has the top T's at east and west). Place the regular pistons at the ends of the T-bars, facing into the machine.
5. Place the layer-2 observers against the slime pillars, then place the layer-4 observerd against the T-bars.
	- Note: the layer-4 observers alternately be placed atop their slime blocks (level 5), each pair facing each (powering the adjacent pistons). This placement fits the entire build in a 5x5x5 cube. However, that higher position slightly obstructs the rider's view, so the original builder prefers the 4-level build.

Usage: The player stands on the pistons surrounding the top central observer, with a redstone torch in hand. The engine can be started in any direction by placing and quickly breaking the torch on that side of the central observer. It is stopped by again placing the torch in the same place (and leaving it until the engine stops). With the machine in motion, placing the torch may be difficult, having a few spares may be wise. Note that it is entirely possible to fall through the corner holes, so step carefully, and stay on the piston you're riding while the machine is in motion.

"A modification using honeyblocks to my second 4 way flying maching making it rideable in survival. The stopping block can be any movable block exept slime and glazed teracotta. i just used honeyblocks because they are easy to break." --FirewolfQuasar

Dimensions: 4x4*x4, JE 1.16+
Materials: 4 observers, 4 sticky pistons, 15* honey blocks. For seating: 1+ minecart(s), 1 rail, 1 block(temporary).
Build guide:
Important note:The build is directional and must be built aligned per theschematicwithNfacing north. This is a restriction due to the update order of the blocks. This build does not work with slime blocks.
1. Place all the honey blocks and sticky pistons first.
2. Install the observers. With honey blockB(the brake) in place, the pistons won't push if they receive a redstone pulse.
3. The optional minecart can be added, by placing any temporary block atT, placing the rail on it, then the cart. Mine blockTand recover it and the rail. This need not be slime as pictured, it just mines quickly.
4. Options: The honey blocks marked*areoptional. If they are in place, anymovableblock except slime and glazed terracotta can be used to stop by placing it atB. If the*honey blocks aren't used, the piston push limit won't be exceeded, so the brakeBblockmustbe a honey block to restrict the pistons. Honey blocks mine easily and have a high rate of recovery in this design, so do make for an effective brake.

Usage: Stand on the north-west honey block (or sit in the minecart). Take note of the pistons and choose the one that will push in the direction you wish to travel. Then update its respective observer. Place a torch, button, or other disposable block on thefaceor otherwise trigger the observer. The disposable item will break or be abandoned when the observer is moved with the machine.
Collision behavior: When the flyer collides with immovable blocks (bedrock, obsidian, furnaces,...), it changes direction depending on its current direction of travel:North: Begins moving west.
West: Begins moving north.
South: Begins moving east.
East: Begins moving south.
If the machine cannot travel in the new direction, it halts. This allows for the construction of 'docks' that are easy to park the machine at, as it favours settling into north-west or south-east corners of immovable blocks.
- View of NW corner
- View of SE corner
- Brake in place, between 2 upper observers
- Direction controls
- Sample dock showing north and west barriers that guide flyer into the corner. Includes button-activated trap-door for departures.

### More complex engines

The following video shows a complex example, an arbitrarily expandable flying machine with a 2-way engine and multiple extension (each carrying 2 TNT Duplicators):




A 4-way engine (2 vertical directions) that switches directions upon contact with a few blocks. 






## Bedrock engine designs
Flying machines are much more restricted in Bedrock Edition due to the lack of quasi-connectivity and other piston behaviors. In Java Edition, a sticky piston powered with a 1 tick pulse will drop the block it is carrying. The absence of these behaviors makes it difficult to create complex flying machines.

#### Simple engine 1
























Simple engine 1, observer and redstone block provide the propulsion.
These are basic flying machine designs. The shown examples will move to the viewer's left.

Removing the block of redstone, or placing obsidian in front of the observer, will cause the machine to stop. This may be hard to do, unless in creative mode.

Simple engine 1 design, with added woodwork forming a gondola for the player. To start and stop, add or remove a piece of wood (such as the piece of acacia wood shown here).
For players who want to ride their flying machine, it may be hard to add and remove the obsidian or redstone block (especially in survival mode). A slightly easier way is to add layers of another material (such as wood plank) to the machine, stopping just before the limit of what a piston can move and doubling as a practical gondola for the player at the same time. From a position sitting on the machine somewhere, the player may add another wood plank block to the machine, killing the speed. Removing the final block causes the machine to start again.

Simple engine 2





















Simple engine 2
The simple engine 2 provides a narrower but longer design, which requires less redstone than others (less redstone blocks). In this example, the machine would begin moving to the left once the observer on the right is activated. This can be done with a redstone pulse, or just lighting the face with flint and steel.

To reverse the direction of this machine, simply move one of the slime blocks to the back, and switch the piston and sticky piston.

This design is ideal when redstone is scarce, or when up to 9 blocks need to be placed on the front end (the front half only consists of 3 blocks, with a total of 12 blocks able to be pushed by the piston).

Trailer

By placing an observer and a sticky piston onto the side, one can build off of the Simple engine 2 design to make the machine bigger as a whole. Keep in mind that multiple trailer attachments can be placed on the side, up, and/or down simultaneously without exceeding the push/pull limit of 12 blocks. This is one way of creating a extension in Bedrock Edition.


This addition can be used to hold more cargo, whether it be entities, chests (which are only movable in Bedrock Edition), or TNT (which can be detonated by a following machine equipped with a redstone block).
