### Bunker
Materials

- 6-8 stacks ofcobblestoneorstone, depending on size
- Torches
- Iron doors
- Glass

Description

This is a relatively simple shelter to build, although requires a fair amount of gathering and smelting to obtain all the required materials.

Location

It can be built on any wide open flat space.

Construction

The bunker is a single-story shelter made entirely of stone, with the walls always being at least two blocks thick. Size is down to the player's preference, although a 12×12 outer wall perimeter will provide ample space inside for a bed, workbench and multiple chests and furnaces. Ideally, an iron door should be placed on at least two sides of the building, in case a creeper remains to lurk outside one door in the morning. Stone buttons or levers can be used to control the doors both inside and out. With the walls being at least two blocks thick, the player can safely sleep in a bed at night without having to worry about being awoken by hostile mobs. Windows should be added on all sides so the player can be certain that the outside of the shelter is clear before venturing out in the morning.

### Underground Bunker
Description

A place to hide out and undetectable from above ground mobs and players. Perfect if you need cobble and you gain materials not lose them.

Construction

Dig down 12-16 blocks dig out a room. Make an iron door at the entrance or you could build a house above that and make a piston entrance. Anyway, you're free to expand and decorate.

### 
Materials

- 8-10 stacks ofstone brickorstone slab, depending on location (far or close to a stronghold)
- Torches
- Iron doors
- Glass

Description

This is a harder shelter to build, mainly because it requires lots of stone or exploring.

Location

It can be built on any wide open flat space.

Construction

The bunker#2 is a single-story shelter made entirely of stone, with the walls always being at least three blocks thick. Size is down to the player's preference, although a 12×12 outer wall perimeter will provide ample space inside for a bed, workbench and multiple chests and furnaces. Ideally, an iron door should be placed on at least two sides of the building, in case a creeper remains to lurk outside one door in the morning. Stone buttons or levers can be used to control the doors both inside and out. With the walls being at least two blocks thick, the player can safely sleep in a bed at night without having to worry about being awoken by hostile mobs. Windows should be added on all sides so the player can be certain that the outside of the shelter is clear before venturing out in the morning. This is especially effective against armies of players, as iron doors and stone bricks are much harder to break, plus, there's the added benefit of having silverfish coming out and attacking the attackers every now and again.

A good idea would be to put guards on a bunch of these outside your PvP base, with TNT in the tunnels if someone breaks through.

### Underground Base
Description
It's a good idea to make you one of these when you spawn because it can protect you from mobs, but you might have to make two stone pickaxes and shovels.

Location
Underground or in cliffs that are not hollow.

Construction

Find a cliff that meets the above specifications. Dig a 1×2 tunnel 4 blocks deep. Then, make a 7×7 3-block high space here. Put up the door and some torches, and voila! Your cave is pretty much complete. Put all of your basic Minecraft home items on the floor next to the walls. You may also want to replace the ugly dirt and stone in the walls and ceiling with some more aesthetic blocks, like wood or (for a more dungeon-like feel) stone bricks.

Notes

Your cave's main weakness is that has only one exit. You may want to dig a 1×2 "emergency exit" out of your base, so that you can sneak out if there are creepers patrolling your main one. It's also preferable to mark the base so that it can be seen from far away.

Extras

- A "balcony" protruding from higher up the side of the cliff, which you can use to snipe mobs.
- Rooms, rooms, rooms. Make branches coming out of your main room leading to smaller (or bigger) rooms, like a bedroom, smelting room, storage room, etc.

### Circular Village
This kind of shelter/village is good on a multiplayer PvP server as it can be defended with a minimum of 3 people with little hassle if you can't defend it, then, you wouldn't be able to defend anything else short of a castle.

The one big drawback of this kind of dwelling is that it is highly visible, although it would be possible to create this in an underground cavern.

Materials

- Lots of cobblestone/or some kind of reasonably hard to break block, if possible use obsidian.

In singleplayer, it is possible to make this out of wood for aesthetic purposes.

Description

- A circular radiating dwelling designed for defensibility combined with eye-pleasing open areas

Location

- Anywhere flat, including large manmade caves and the Nether

Construction

- On your first night, build a small house.

This is the center of your village, around it you will construct your other buildings

- Next up, you need to create 3 buildings around your center one, this may take quite some time.

There should be 2 L shaped ones and one straight one so that there are three entrances leading to your central building, like so:



|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

- There should be no doors facing outwards so that the only ways into or out of the village are through the gaps in the buildings, or through the buildings themselves.
- The gaps are easier to defend if they are only one block wide. Now, all you have to do on a PvP faction server is to recruit 2 more people, and when you get attacked, stick one person at each gap.
- As your faction grows you may wish to build a further group of encircling buildings, but remember to only ever have as many gaps as you have people and, when the outer circle falls, fall back to the middle.

Notes

- Always remember that those gaps aren't impervious, and you're sure going to receive company with that size of the village.
- An obvious thing to do with this design would be to cut out 2 gaps and just make a C (or O with adooror hole) shaped building all around the outside, you can do this to obvious defensive benefit, feel free.

Extras

- A panic room (never put this in the center, put it where they'll least expect it).
- Farms (there are two good places to put farms, the first is around the outer edge of your village, in the same style as the buildings, this adds to beauty, and the second is to place them in the gaps between the central house and the others meaning you're less likely to have them griefed or stolen, as players have to get past your cordon first).
- Bonfire!On singleplayer, you can redesign your central building into an eating area with a bonfire and ovens, but this is purely aesthetic and will have no use in multiplayer whatsoever, and make sure you don't put any flammable block near the fire.
