### Tree trap
























The tree trap
When the player chops down the tree, the TNT will be lit by the observer. The observer can be replaced by a lever and a NOT Gate if you are short on quartz.                          

How to Build an Exploding Tree Trap by Bugo03. Uses a NOT Gate for all of you who are low on quartz.

### Cake trap
























Replace the slab with cake. Replace the dirt with any block.
You eat the cake, you explode! In this trap when you eat the cake, the observer senses the update in the cake and ignites the TNT. 1) Dig down 2 blocks. 2) Place the observer at the bottom. 3) On top of the observer place a cake. 4) under the observer place the TNT.

If you place before the TNT you'll explode.


### Death temple
























Replace sand with sandstone.
Create BUD underneath the pressure plate in a desert temple. If a player should try to disarm it, KABOOM! Note that if you use the observer, players might be able to detect it, since the pressure plate won't cover it completely.


### The hidden house
























TNT field trap
This trap is the opposite of a TNT door trap: The TNT is obvious, while the house is hidden. Make a field of TNT extending about 5 blocks into the ground. Place signs all over the field saying: "Find my hidden house." It lures people in twice: the TNT danger, and the hidden house challenge. The problem is that there is no house! Beneath the field are pressure plates which ignite the TNT, leaving no time to escape, as you are in a field of TNT 5 blocks under.


### TNT floor house
Blow up a fake base and kill assassins attacking you! (this can also be used for demolition)

1. Build a base, preferably a half-hidden one, as not to arouse suspicion.
2. Make the floor withTNTand put some carpet on it to look like a normal decorated house.
3. Have an iron door as the entrance, with a pressure plate to open it. Redirect the pressure plate toward the base.
4. Below, place a block of TNT, but an extra step you can take is to have a circuit which delays the fuse using repeaters so the target won't retreat as soon as they hear thehisssof the TNT.

If any enemy, mob or player steps on the pressure plate (potential griefers included), they will be blown sky-high!


### Explosive house
Griefers love blowing and burning people's houses up. This trap turns the grief onto the griefer.

1. Make a decoy house out ofwoodand possiblywool.
2. Fill the area under it with TNT and make some "rays" of TNT extend from the house.
3. If a griefer happens to burn the house down, they will probably get a bit more of a bang than they expected!

If you use this for demolition (that is, if you have any fragile buildings to be destroyed), you can set it and wait for somebody else to do the work for you by setting it off unknowingly.


### C4 trap
The "C4 trap" is a vertical or horizontal stack of TNT with a button wired to a dispenser with a fire charge in it. The dispenser is placed one block above or below the stack (vertical) or one block next to the stack (horizontal). This usually works better for demolition than for a trap. If you want to use it as a trap, wire a pressure plate to the dispenser. This works similarly to a flaming arrow hitting a stack of TNT from above. This works better than a dispenser shooting TNT, because the "C4" stays in one place. Also, if only two TNT blocks are used, it works well as a disposable cannon, even better on obsidian blocks, but not in a tube. All evidence of the trap is usually destroyed. Note: C4 trap from below does not work well.

### Exploding furnace
Want a big unexpected boom? Have a bunch of spare furnaces? You need a Redstone comparator, TNT, a furnace and something to smelt. Place the furnace, and then put the comparator directly behind it. Then, just put the TNT behind the comparator and wait till someone smelts something!

An alternative is to put coal, iron, or food in a furnace and add a redstone comparator behind linked to a not gate. Use the not gate to trigger some tnt. Also hide observers under the furnace so people can't break it.

### Inescapable arrow trap
Like to kill your fellow players with protection IV armor? You need many harming II arrows, a bow, soul sand, and water. Use the water and soul sand to make a bubble column, then shoot arrows into the pit until you run out. It will instantly kill anyone that falls in! Just don't fall in yourself.

## Pitfall traps
These traps primarily use fall damage to harm the target. Some minor variation can make a simple pit much more deadly.

- Make checkerboard pattern ofcactiat the bottom of a pit. Cacti does destroy items, though.
- To effectively improve the size of your pit without digging a larger area, dig a shallow ring around the top layer of your pit. Fill this area withwaterso that mobs will be dragged to the center. Note that this will reduce fall damage.

### Sand trap


























































Sand trap
When the target walks on top of the trap, break the bottom block of sand. It is a good idea to disguise the trap by making a house on top of the sand. If you do this, you will probably want to put in carpet so as to not make it so obvious. Some variations:

- You may be able to get the target to break the sand themselves by making the bottom block valuable.
- You can automate the trap by attaching apistonto the bottom block of sand. If you want to retract the piston when apressure plateis pressed, use aNOT Gate. You could also use an observer and a piece of bait to lure in any players wanting a piece of that[whatever valuable block you placed].
