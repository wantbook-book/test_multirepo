#### Spider jockeys

Main article: Spider jockey
Skeletons riding spiders have 1⁄100 chance to spawn in place of a regular spider. Such combination is more dangerous than both mobs separately, as the spider pounces and climb to the player, while the skeleton shoots them with arrows. On Hard difficulty, a spider jockey deals a total of 5.5 hearts of damage if attacked head-on. 

However, if the spider climbs onto ceiling, skeleton will suffocate. Mount from this point behaves like a normal spider. Similarly, if a jockey spots you from a high place, the skeleton may command the spider to jump, hurting or killing it in the process. Rider behaves then like a normal skeleton.

You can attack spider jockeys with a bow outside of the mobs' search range. Targeting the skeleton first is recommended. All strategies for skeletons and spiders apply here as well.

The spider jockey has other variants, such as one where the spider is being ridden by a stray. These variants can only spawn in snowy biomes and are more dangerous than their normal counterparts, due to stray arrows giving players slowness, while the spider tries to approach you.

In Bedrock Edition, the spider jockey has two more variants, which are the cave spider jockey and the stray cave spider jockey. These can only be found in a mineshaft. However, due to mineshaft being an enclosed space, even if such jockey spawns, it's almost guaranteed that the rider suffocates shortly after, as cave spiders tend to climb onto mineshaft's ceiling quite often.

Spiders can't spawn naturally in the Nether, but if spawned with commands/spawn eggs, they can rarely spawn as wither skeleton spider jockey‌[Bedrock Edition  only]. Dealing with such dangerous hybrids from afar is strongly recommended.

#### Guardians

The guardian has two methods of damaging the player: engaging a laser-like beam and a thorn-like defense. The beam takes several seconds to charge, doing no damage while charging, and changes from purple initially to bright yellow when fully charged. Then the beam abruptly disappears and deals damage. The guardian swims around for a few seconds before firing again. If the target comes near the guardian while it is firing its beam, it stops firing and swim away until it is at a comfortable range, at which point it continues attacking. 

Guardian, unlike most other hostile mobs, doesn't follow the player if they move out of sight. Instead, it simply continues swimming until the player becomes visible again, and then starts to charge its attack. The beam cannot be dodged, as it follows the player, but can be obstructed by solid blocks, and has a range of approximately 15 blocks. When beam fully charges up, it deals 4 damage on Easy, 6 on Normal and 9 on Hard. 

Guardians also have spikes on their bodies. Although these spikes don't do any direct damage upon contact or as a melee attack, they act similar to the Thorns enchantment. 
The guardian deals 2 (on Easy and Normal) or 3 damage (on Hard) every time it is hit when its spikes are extended. If cornered, the guardian usually extends its spikes and fire its laser at you, even at point-blank range. If you must melee a guardian, you should try to corner it.

If brought to land, they may take fall damage from their swift and erratic movement.

The guardian cannot shoot as fast as a player with a bow can, so a skilled player is able to shoot the guardian, and then hide to break the beam's lock, repeating until the guardian is dead. Arrows slow down and eventually fall when in water, so you may be forced to shoot at a very close range. If you want to use a ranged attack, a trident is a viable choice as it doesn't slow down underwater. Enchanting it with Impaling V greatly helps with guardians, but killing them in one hit is impossible in Survival mode, even with Strength II, as they have 30 × 15 health.

Fighting guardians is incredibly dangerous without armor, especially inside of an ocean monument. Entering their territory without armor often leads to a swift death, even if armed with a sword or trident.

Using the combined effects of Depth Strider III, Speed II and sprinting, you can actually swim faster than the guardians, which allows you to sneak up on them or to escape their beams. Players can also use trident with Riptide III, and when the guardian uses its laser attack, quickly use the trident and aim into it, so guardian takes damage from the trident and stops using its laser due to the player being too close. 

##### Elder guardians

See also: Elder guardian

The elder guardian has 80 × 40 points of health, making melee kills even harder. Elder guardians do more damage than regular guardians, but general tactics for fighting them are similar. Armor worn should include diamond or netherite equipment enchanted with Respiration (or turtle shells due to their longer breath), Protection and Depth Strider. They also give players Mining Fatigue III, making it almost impossible to tunnel out in case of emergency or to mine the gold treasure inside the ocean monument. It also slows the player's attacks.

Milk buckets are a good way to get rid of the Mining Fatigue, but keep in mind that there are three elder guardians in each monument, which continue to curse you once per minute until you kill all of them.

You can use a trident with Impaling V and Riptide III enchantments to ram into the elder guardian. If under the effect of Strength II, you can cause massive damage to the mob; this attack kills an elder guardian in just three hits.

#### Silverfish

See also: Silverfish

Silverfish spawn from a silverfish spawner, which only naturally generates in strongholds, or from breaking an infested block. Infested blocks can be disguised as cobblestone, stone, stone bricks and variants of stone bricks, and generate in strongholds, igloo basement, woodland mansion's fake portal room, and in mountain biomes. The breaking speed of infested blocks is the same with any type of tool or bare hand, making it easy to find which blocks are infested blocks. When using the player's hand to break blocks, infested blocks break a lot faster than cobblestone, stone, or stone bricks, but when using a better quality pickaxe, such as iron or diamond, infested blocks break a lot slower than cobblestone, stone, or stone bricks. Infested blocks spawn one silverfish when mined.

One silverfish only deals very little damage (1, or even 0 with better quality armor on), and has only 8 health. However, when you attack a silverfish, it can summon other silverfish hiding in other nearby infested blocks. This problem can be solved by killing a silverfish in one hit. In Java Edition, you can do this with a stone axe (or better), or a maxed diamond sword. In Bedrock Edition, the weapon of choice should be enchanted with Bane of Arthropods or be used with critical hits. With the Sharpness enchantment, you can also do this with a stone axe, iron axe, diamond axe or diamond sword. 

If you are going to the End and the silverfish spawner in the end portal room is bugging you, just destroy it. Silverfish don't drop anything upon death, so it won't be useful to make a silverfish farm unless you want an XP only farm.
