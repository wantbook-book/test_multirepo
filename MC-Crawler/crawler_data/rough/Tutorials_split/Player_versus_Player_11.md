#### General Playstyle Information
- Typically, the KB1 sword is simply a better option. Knockback is, generally speaking, just good for you. However, using a No-KB sword is still valid when you don't want to hit them away. Using W-release sweep hits or W-release crits with it deals almost no knockback. These situations mostly include when your opponent is very low and needs to run, when you want to play very close and critspam, backstab, or pcrit, or if you want to surprise your opponent by changing the spacing between you two.

- When playing against an extremely defensive player, its possible to run into them and let them hit you first, and then counter their attack depending on what it is. Preferrably you have an health advantage when doing this, but waiting for their hit will give you an opportunity to get a successful attack on them.

- When you and your opponent get very low, a good option is to offhand totem and rush your opponent in hopes of dropping them immediately. This strategy is slightly less effective in evaluation matches because you have only 1 totem, but in a real SMP, you can bring lots of them.

- Most skilled players have great reactions, but it takes more experience to change their playstyle on the go. If you begin playing very defensive, using crit deflections, combos, and backing out, they will most likely try to counter with something like a No-KB crit. This is easy to predict, and so you can counter by suddenly becoming very agressive, double-critting, backstabbing, and pushing hard into them. Changing your playstyle is a good idea if your opponent seems to be predicting and outplaying you in exchanges.

- It is possible to neglect fire resistance potions. One player, Marlowww, became the best player in the world until she retired by using this strategy, but almost no other high level players have been able to use this strategy since. The concept is that by constantly taking fire ticks of damage, your opponent won't be able to correctly knock you back. If you want to try this playstyle, notice that your combos will be very hard to break, and crit deflecting you won't work quite right. You need to play fast, close, and aggressive.

#### 
Minecraft ping is coded differently from other games. The two differences are that you can hit a player when you can hit them on your computer, even if your opponent and the server agree you can't yet, and your knockback is delayed by your ping. If you have 100 ping, you only start taking knockback after the 1/10 a second has passed for your computer to find out you got hit. 
Fighting Ping: Any opponent that has ping has slower reactions. Strategies like No-KB crits that require immediate counters work very well. Their shield disabling will also be very delayed: you can get away with much more aggressive shield usage. Don't try to combo against ping as much because their knockback is delayed, giving them a window to hit you. If you do, use Silly Circle Hitting or side strafes to make them miss, since laggy players often have more trouble hitting you. Low ping players should play more defensively since they can react very quickly.
Using Ping: You are far harder to combo on high ping, since your knockback is literally delayed, giving you an extra window to hit your opponents. Its better to be using an agressive playstyle. Use the Spacing Techniques detailed earlier in the guide to get in constant extra hits and pcrits before knockback takes place. It's also more difficult for you to be KB hit away, so a crit spammy playstyle is very effective (and annoying) here.

## PVP Mistakes
The world of PVP is vast as it takes place in a sandbox game, giving players many options, and not all of them are good, despite how tempting they may seem. A great way to learn your mistakes is to watch better players play and simply try to notice what's different. Why might they be playing that way or using that item?

### Gear Misconceptions
- Tridents

When the trident was released, players jumped to use the new PVP item, a versatile weapon for ranged and melee. However, sadly, when min-maxxing in PVP, the trident falls short of an axe in melee and can't rival the bows damage in range. Tridents should therefore not be used as a weapon unless no other ranged option exists.

- Healing Potions

Healing potions are sometimes considered popular, but this is largely due to faction servers such as Loka or older servers where better options were not available. Healing potions take up huge amounts of inventory and hotbar space and are outpaced by the stackable Golden Apple, which should be your go-to healing item.

- Harming Potions

Harming Potions are able to bypass armor but cannot bypass the Protection enchant. They do not drain your opponent's durability either, giving you meager returns for so many inventory slots filled.

- Firework Rockets

Firework Rockets are often said to do much more damage than they actually can in PVP. They can still be an effective way to drain your opponents armor durability and as a huge plus fill their screen with colors and effects. However, they are not the superweapon they can be made out to be.

- No Knockback Sword

Many players automatically bring just a singular non-knockback sword to fights. This is a huge mistake! Netherite armor makes Combo Hits completely ineffective in many scenarios, letting your opponent crit you out without good counter options. Knockback 1 levels the playing field again, making their knockback similar to as if they were only wearing Diamond armor, letting you use your full range of tactics on them.

### Strategy Misconceptions
- Overemphasis on Range

Despite the intuitiveness of ranged weapons, most ranged weapons deal lackluster damage against a geared opponent if compared to sword crits while shields offer a near impenetrable defense. Usage of ender pearls to rush archers is also a problem for bow-reliant players, where they can get many crits off while taking little damage in return for each engagement. Bows are a good tool for utility and chipping at your opponent, but not a primary weapon. 

- Offhanding Totem

The Totem of Undying is a popular offhand choice, but there is one simple problem: It does not do anything. It should be used when you are very low health to prevent death, but when you aren't at risk of dying, a shield or other utility item will help you far more than the golden statue.

- Reliance on Axe

A netherite axe with sharpness 5 and strength II will deal 19 damage, only 11% more damage than a sword would deal, despite the attack speed of under 2/3 the sword attack speed. Using the axe just for the extra damage is usually not a good tactic as you just don't get enough value from it. It's true value comes from its shield disabling ability. It should almost only be used either be used spam clicking to disable shields, or using a fully charged axe attack when you have the time to prevent your opponent from blocking it.

- Escaping Cobwebs

Many players use water to escape cobwebs, as this is the most intuitive way. Indeed this is a solid option, but if ender pearls are available, always use them. Ender pearls are instant and can get you out much more smoothly, leaving no reason to let yourself get hit as you wash away the cobweb.

- Using Milk

Milk is a common way to escape negative status effects. However, milk also removes your positive status effects! Strength, speed and fire resistance are all crucial. Honey is still viable to clear Poison as it does not clear your positive effects.
