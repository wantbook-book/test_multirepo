### Work tents
If you feel that you're running out of inventory space frequently during above ground projects, build a work tent. Make a 6×6 fence box, add a door and wooden roof, and place lots of chests. Add a least 1 furnace and a workbench. Dig a little ditch in case a skeleton or spider appears. This can double as a safe-house/tent.

### Mining rig
Create a platform on top of a relatively flat surface or mountain. Dig out a trench in the middle of it and place redstone on either side. Connect the redstone to a single button and fill the trench with TNT. All you need to do is to press the button and you begin digging a pit that leads to the bottom of the world. An automatic reloader can be added via sand and pistons. (This can be easily re-purposed into a cannon.)

### Toilet
You never know when nature calls. You can make a small toilet out of water and sticky pistons or trapdoors. It can be used as a garbage disposal or just for laughs.

### Mob aquarium
A glass box with a mob spawning room above it with a connecting hole so mobs spawn and fall in. You could make a glowstone lamp inside to.

### Testing room
Saw this great creation online but never knew how to build it? Following a guide how to build things without risks? Want to warm up on traps and other things with no damage to your shelter? A testing room has various things you have never hoped to build before. Cover it with obsidian to reduce damage to shelter, or make a new world to test new things.

### Canal
This is a good way to get around if you live in the middle of a huge island. The best kind is a 2×3 extending where ever you need to go.

### 
If you have procured yourself some Mods you can actually make a real landing site. Once you've got a plane or two, you can store them somewhere away from the creepers or other players. So behind your base, get black wool flooring for at least a 30×30 area and put nether brick fences or just normal fences all around it. Then, build a dome out of glass blocks big enough to get a plane into it. Repeat the third step for the rest of your planes.

### Water elevator
If you live in any building that is more than one story, you might want a method to get up and down easily without stairs or a ladder. One way to do this is to make a waterfall that falls through the center of the structure. Make sure to have one block of space on any side of it so that your character can be outside of the water enough to breathe while climbing it. Simply hold down the jump button (the space bar) while inside the waterfall to ascend. This method can also be used to create an elevator to flying islands or houses.

### Warehouse
This is for huge things, such as giant iron golems or airplanes. Build a huge area with at least 40×40×20 with cobblestone or other high blast resistance/hitbox item, and then build your thing. You could also fill it with thousands of chests with your stuff!

### Underground homes
This is an efficient way to have a surplus of players, so you can have a large number of places to live! Furthermore, you lose virtually no items at all!

### Highway
An extremely fast way to get from one place to another. A minecart could be used on a powered rail to speed up the process. It can also look good with a Station.

### Core control Room
It's good if you like redstone use this to control all redstone circuits or only for decoration. You can place a beacon in the middle with glass to make it fancier.

## Exterior constructions
These are mostly used for aesthetic purposes, but there are exceptions such as automatic farms located outside.

### Lava pit
This is just a hole in the ground that can be 1×1 or 4×4. Fill it with lava, and then you can throw items you don't need or items taking up space into the hole to watch them BURN! This isn't always outside your base but it isn't recommended if you have a floor or wall near if the base is made out of wood, planks or wool due to the risk of it catching on fire and your base burning down.

### Snow farm
Main article: Tutorials/Snow farming
This is basically a caged snow golem arranged so that you can dig at the snow trail beneath it. (See the snow golem page for plans and tips.) Unfortunately, this doesn't work in all biomes: In a desert, or the Nether, snow golems die quickly, and in several other biomes (swamp, mushroom island) they do not form a snow trail. Remember to protect your golem from rain and stray mobs — especially, block off their firing capability so they don't provoke passing creepers and skeletons! (You can also use snow golems for defense towers, but that's different from farming snow.)

### 
A Zen Garden is for aesthetic purposes only. A Zen Garden is made by choosing the place where you want it to be. Then make the walls surrounding the garden with any material you like. I like to use leaves or maybe cobblestone wall. Then fill the walled up space with any kinds of trees, flowers maybe melons, pumpkins, sugar cane, mushrooms and maybe even a small fountain. Do whatever but try to make it as natural as possible. I don't recommend to build this in multiplayer because griefers can find your house more easily but there is the exception of Faction servers in which you can claim land or servers in which you can buy a block that protects a radius.
