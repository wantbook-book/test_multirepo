This method exploits the fact that zombies can transform into drowned while they are dying. If you coax a zombie to pick up an item by throwing one at it and then kill it right at the moment that it converts to a drowned, the zombie will die and drop what it was holding but the newly spawned drowned will be holding a duplicate of the item. This can also work with husks transforming into zombies.

##### 
When you overflow chunk memory, you will be able to freeze the chunk. What this means is that changes on this chunk will not be saved and after loading it again it will return to the previous state.
The best way to do this is to create books filled with about fifty pages of random Unicode characters and put it in a chest. There are mods for doing this automatically, but you can also do it manually by copying and pasting. You will need two different types of books for this to work.

1. Choose a chunk in which you want to duplicate and do everything only in this chunk (Press F3 + G to see chunk borders).
2. Get 22 books filled with random characters, name them "X" and 21 filled books but with other characters, name them "Y".
3. Place a chest and put the items you want to duplicate inside it.
4. Place a chest at the same chunk and put them in this pattern:X|Y|X|Y|X|Y|X|Y|X
Y|X|Y|X|Y|X|Y|X|Y
X|Y|X|Y|X|Y|X|Y|X
	- You will have 8 books of each type left.
5. Place a chest above it and put 8 of book X in slot 1 and 8 of book Y in slot 2 in that chest.
6. Reload chunk by reconnecting to the world(if you are on singleplayer) or going 200-300 blocks away and returning(if you are on multiplayer)
7. Move books from the second chest like this:X|Y|X|Y|X|Y|X|Y|X
Y|X|Y|X|Y|X|Y
8. Take out the items you wanted to duplicate into your inventory or put them in a chest at the other chunk.
9. Reload chunk again.
10. Now you have your item(s) in the chest and in your inventory. Books in a second chest are just like in [4].

In 1.14+:

1. Press F3+G to see the chunk border.
2. Place a chest in the chunk that you want to duplicate, then place another chest above it.
3. Then, put the items that you wanted to duplicate in the upper chest.
4. After that, put 5 book and quills that filled in with 100 pages of random unicode characters in the bottom chest like this.X = 1 book; Y = stack of 2 books
X|X|X|Y|
5. After that, press esc and select 'Save and Quit to title' to save the chunk (If you're in singleplayer) or walk 400 blocks away from the chunk (If you're in multiplayer, make sure of the other players were stayed in the nether else the duplication won't work). This method will save the chunk.
6. Then, log-in your world again (If you're in singleplayer) or walk back to the chunk (If you're in multiplayer).
7. Open the bottom chest and move the books like this:X|X|X|X|X|
8. Take your items away from the upper chest and move them to your inventory or put them in a chest at the other chunk.
9. Save that chunk again.
10. Go back to the chunk again.
11. Your items will reappear in the upper chest. The books will be reverted to the state in step 4. Duplication complete.

##### 
Relogging at the same time as you drop items can dupe items. Needs very precise timing; exit the second you see the items but before you hear the sound of collecting items.

##### 
When an item frame is removed (broken by the player) from the rear of a piston as the piston is retracting, the correct timing will yield two items of the item that was within the frame. This will work with any blocks or items inside of the frame, with shulker boxes being able to duplicate multiple items at once. This method works in both singleplayer and multiplayer game modes.

##### 
This method can also be used to stack unstackable items, such as diamond swords.

1. Put 2-3 stacks of planks in your inventory.

2. Drop the item that you want to dupe on the ground. (Make sure that there is no item that it can stack within your inventory!)

3. Open your inventory and spam the crafting table recipe until you pick up the item you dropped. It should result in a stack of that item.

##### 
Put a dolphin in a nether portal as it absorbs an item. The original item will still be there, while the dolphin will carry a copy.

##### 
Fill your inventory with items. Repeatedly rename the item you want to duplicate on an anvil until the anvil breaks. When it does, you will drop double the renamed item. If it is not working look at how it's being done in this video: https://youtube.com/watch?v=oSdwwxBgWco (Original Finder)

This method is similar to Chunk memory overflow for 1.14+ singleplayer, with the following differences:

- For step 4, put twocurse of vanishingenchanted books instead of the book and quills.
- For step 7, take the enchanted books, combine them in agrindstone, and move them to your inventory and then to the bottom chest byShift+ clicking.

#### 
This method works by using redstone torches to power large dripleaves with sand blocks placed above them to duplicate sand. It's recommended to build this in either the Nether or the End. 

1. Gather at least 2 sand blocks, 1 redstone torch, 1 dirt (or any other block dripleaf can be placed on) and 1 large dripleaf.

2. Build a Nether portal.

3. Secure the portal and either build a shelter or dig as many blocks down respective to the amount of sand you're using to safely house your duplication system.

4. Place the block(s) you're using to plant your dripleaf.

5. Place the redstone torch adjacent to your dripleaf to power it.

6. Place the sand on top of the dripleaf.

7. Leave the Nether.

8. Re-enter the Nether portal.

9. The sand should be duplicated once you re-enter the Nether.
