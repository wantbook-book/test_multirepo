## Description

  

This section needs expansion. 
You can help by expanding it.


The base Minecraft game logo is 3D text containing "MINECRAFT", rotated slightly upward. It appears to be made of cracked stone in older designs, or stone with etch marks in newer designs, and the letter A has the face of a creeper as a hole. Several variations exist, also containing 3D text though not always with the stone material.
