## Introduction
If you read the beginner's guide and followed it, you should have at least a crude shelter, stone tools, and some cooked meat and other food. This second-day tutorial builds upon that to guide you in setting up a better base.

When you venture outside after surviving your first night, be on the lookout for hostile mobs from the previous night. Hunting for them happens after you get weapons, some armor, and proper food supply.

- At this stage,creepers are deadly. Run away until theydespawnor lose track of you.
- Skeletons andzombies may survive in water or shady spots; lead them into the sun and avoid them until they burn to death, then collect theirdrops. If you're unlucky enough to encounter ahusk, armored mob or ababy zombie, run away from it until it despawns or loses track of you. Remember that baby zombies are faster than regular zombies, and skeletons are generally smart enough not to be lured into the sunlight.
- Spiders are neutral in the daytime, so you can avoid them; if one has targeted you, lead it into the sun and run it around until it loses interest. If you are confident, this is a good time to perform a surprise attack on them and get a few pieces ofstring. Attacking a spider doesn't anger other spiders nearby, so you can safely track each of them down.
- Endermenare neutral unless you look directly at their face, so avoid looking at them at all costs. Remember, they could kill you with ease, so you'd better stay away from them at this stage.

As you move around:

- Keep track of where you are, using thedebug screenby pressingF3if needed.
- If you do get killed at this point, you haven't lost much, and you're presumably still near the spawn point. Just head back to your death location to collect your items within 5 minutes.
- Collect any loose items you see, including but not limited to:bones,arrows,rotten flesh,eggs, andink sacs. Almost everything becomes useful later.
- Destroy anyshort grassyou see and collect thewheat seedsthey drop.
	- If you seechickens, holdwheat seedsin your hand to lure some home. If necessary, just stuff them inside your house until you have time to build a proper pen. Save theeggs for later.
- If you findmushrooms, break and grab some of them. If you can get both kinds of mushrooms, you can makemushroom stew. You might also collectflowersfor thedyesyou can make from them, or decoration. Flowers have another use too, but this isn't useful for now.
- After choppingtrees, collect thesaplings(and perhapsapple) that drop from theleaves.
- Mine anyiron oreyou find with astone pickaxe. Using awooden onecauses it to mine slower and not drop anything. Also mine some of thecoal ore.
- As you're moving around the area, keep an eye on how the ground rises and falls. Over time, you may be fencing off more and more territory to keep monsters out, starting with the area right around your house (orcaveentrance). If the terrain is uneven, you'll probably run your fences along ridges, avoiding places where mobs could jump over the fence from a hill or cliff.

### Reviewing hunger and food
Main article: Food
Main article: Hunger § Mechanics
The "First Day" guide briefly discussed hunger, but by your second day this hunger becomes more urgent, requiring you to obtain food.

Besides the visible hunger bar, you also have an invisible hunger bar, called "saturation". When the game starts, the hunger bar is full, but you have only 5 saturation points. Like your health bar and hunger bar, this maxes out at 20 points (each "shank" of the visible bar represents two points), although it is never higher than your hunger level.  Whenever you do something that would make you hungry, the saturation gets used up first, which provides extra time before you get hungry again. Most foods provide saturation as well as filling the visible bar, and the "better" foods provide more saturation per hunger point restored. The general rule is that, apart from the golden foods, cooked beef and cooked porkchops are the best, followed by other cooked meats (or fish), bread, and vegetables. Cooked foods are always better than their uncooked counterparts.

The biggest drain on hunger is healing damage, but for quite some time (until you get golden apples and potions), this is the only way to heal damage! In Java Edition you heal faster when your hunger bar is full and have some extra saturation, and if your hunger bar is below 18 ( × 9), you cannot heal at all.  Each point of damage healed costs the equivalent of 1.5 () hunger, or 3⁄4 of a shank.

A few other activities also cause hunger, though at a slower rate:

- Fighting: Both attackingmobsand receiving damage costs hunger, even before you start trying tohealdamage. (60 blows either way matches healing.) You can slaughter a few animals but pick your fights carefully. Taking damage in other ways counts for this too, but each time you take damage it counts as one "blow" no matter how much damage you took.
- Sprinting: You sprint (run faster) by double-tapping the forward movement key (Wby default), or pressing the sprint key (Left Ctrlby default). While you move faster, sprinting uses up food. (60 meters matches healing.)
- Jumping: Obviously, you'll need to jump some just to get around, but don't bounce around randomly or unnecessarily. (120 jumps matches healing.) Sprinting jumps are especially costly, 4 times as much as a regular jump, although they are the fastest mode of transportation early in the game.  Don't neglect the automatic jumps from Autojump, going uphill can add up!
- Swimmingandminingblocks cost a little hunger, but those are fairly minimal compared to the activities above.

Note that if you are staying at full health, and not fighting, sprinting and/or jumping, or mining blocks, then you use almost no food. Thus, if your character has a secure place to stay, you can just stay put to conserve food while waiting out the night, a storm, or crop/animal growth. Walking around at normal speed uses no hunger.  So if you are injured and/or hungry, it's best to wait out the night quietly in your home (perhaps doing some crafting or smelting) until daylight, when it is safe to go out and find some food. Sleeping works too unless you're actually starving, in which case you can't sleep at all since you'll be taking damage.

If your hunger bar is completely empty, you begin to starve, and take damage until you are down to half health in easy difficulty, or a single hit point in normal difficulty. You shouldn't be on hard difficulty for this first game, but if you are, you can actually starve to death. Well before this point (under 3.5 shanks or 7 hunger), you can no longer sprint.

Therefore, if you are low on health or critically low on food, getting food is a priority:

- You can kill a few animals upfront, but they'll run out quickly, and you need to save some forbreeding. Again, cooking the meat makes it more nourishing.
- Wheat takes a day or two to grow, as do other crops when you get them.
- If you have afishing rodand a safe place to fish,fishingis a great way to get food, because it doesn't involve fighting, mining, or moving around much. Once you have a fishing rod and a furnace in which to cook the fish, you typically don't need any other source of food. Campfires are even better for this in the early game because it has a cheap crafting recipe and uses no fuel. Putting a hay bale under it creates a smoke signal that you can see from a distance. If near ariverorocean, you can alternatively slaughtercodandsalmonmobs with asword, as they can abundantly spawn and it's a faster way to gather fish than rod-fishing. You cansmeltyour first few fish while you fish for more.
- Dried kelpandsweet berriesare easy to obtain, and can restore your food bar if you have enough. Watch out for thosesweet berry bushes, though, and drowning is bad too.
- If you're desperate, you can try breakingoak leavesordark oak leavesforapples. Using ahoeallows you to break leaves a lot faster. Be careful to not take damaging falls or jump around a lot in the process, much less get attacked by monsters.
- If you arereallydesperate you can also eatrotten fleshdropped byzombies, but this usually gives youfood poisoning, a.k.a. the Hunger effect, which would drain your hunger by almost as much as one piece of rotten flesh fills it. The trick is, if you have alotof rotten flesh you can quickly fill up on that, then tough out the food poisoning and end up not too hungry.
