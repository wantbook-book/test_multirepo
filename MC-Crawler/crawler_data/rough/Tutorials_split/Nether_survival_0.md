## Introduction
The Nether is a dangerous place for even experienced players. It is filled with a host of exclusive mobs not found in the Overworld: hostile blazes, wither skeletons, ghasts, magma cubes, hoglins, piglins, and piglin brutes, and the neutral zombified piglin, as well as one passive mob, the strider. 

The terrain is much harsher to navigate than in the Overworld: one false step could mean death by fiery lava. Nether fortresses and bastion remnants both spawn in the Nether. Nether fortresses are the homes of wither skeletons and blazes, and piglin brutes, piglins, and hoglins all spawn in bastion remnants.

This guide is intended to help you increase your chances of survival in the Nether and opening up a lot of gameplay such as brewing, nether hubs, the End, and the ender dragon and wither bosses.

## Making a nether portal
To make a nether portal, the player needs to make a rectangular frame of obsidian, though the corners do not have to be obsidian.  

- The minimum size for the frame is 5 high by 4 wide, which requires 10 blocks of obsidian and produce the "classic" nether portal 3 high by 2 wide within it.
	- The corners can be any block  (including more obsidian) or none at all.
	- The frame can be larger, as long as it is rectangular and there are no other blocks inside the rectangle.
	- Aruined portalcan provide a partial frame for the player to complete, but any crying obsidian must be removed from the frame, as that isnota valid frame block.
- The "traditional" way to create the frame is simply to get 10 or more blocks of obsidian (mined or from loot chests) and place them into the frame shape.
	- Alternatively, a portal frame can be partly or completely "cast" in place, as described below.  This is useful if the player does not have a diamond pickaxe.
- Once the frame is built, a fire block anywhere within the frame activates the portal.
	- The traditional way to light the portal is with aflint and steel.
	- Afire chargealso works. Fire charges require a Nether material to craft (blaze powder), but even in the Overworld they can be found in a ruined portal chest.
	- Lacking either of these, any other source of fire works; if wooden blocks are placed facing the portal (but notinthe frame) lava can be used to set those afire, providing the needed fire block.
	- Note thatFire AspectandFlamedonotwork to light the portal, since a fire block is required.

### Using lava and water
"No diamond" portal making.
A player can cast part or all of frame in place, by placing lava source blocks and using water to convert them to obsidian.  

- This only works in the Overworld, as water cannot be placed in the Nether, not even long enough to convert lava. Water in a cauldron doesnotwork, and in the End, nether portals do not work at all.
- The water does not need to flowoverthe lava; any lava source block that finds water (source or flowing) next to it gets converted immediately.
- Flowinglava converts to cobblestone, and if lava flows into the water it converts the water to stone or cobblestone; if either is inside the frame it must be removed before lighting the portal.
- The lavacanbe carried in as many buckets, but if a lava pool is handy, one or two buckets are required to fetch each block as needed.

#### Brute-force method
1. Build a mold out of dirt for the bottom: a trench 1 wide and 2 or 4 long.
2. Fill each block of the trench from a lava bucket, then place the water on a mold block to flood the lava and turn it into obsidian (if it turns into stone or cobblestone instead, then the player may have misplaced a source block. One can fix this problem by mining out the stone or cobblestone and trying again).
3. Extend your frame upward and repeat the process to mold the next layers: three levels of two separated pits for the portal sides, then another trench for the top.
4. Dig away the dirt frame, and light the new portal.
