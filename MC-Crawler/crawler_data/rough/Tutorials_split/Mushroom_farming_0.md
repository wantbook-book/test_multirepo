## Huge mushrooms
Huge mushroom minimum growth requirements
Using bone meal on either a red or brown mushroom causes a huge mushroom to grow if enough room is available, and if the mushroom is planted on the appropriate block. Huge mushrooms can give at least 20 mushrooms when harvested. The image to the right illustrates the minimum growth requirements:

- The wood above illustrates the minimum height required to grow a huge mushroom of that size. Huge mushrooms can be 5, 6, or 7 blocks tall, with the maximum height being 1 block shorter than the available space above it. Thus, if there is a block 7 meters above, the huge mushroom always grows to be 5 blocks tall.
- Theslabsbelow illustrate the area required, 7×7, as well as the fact that the blocks immediately adjacent to the stalk must be free, but not the rest of the bottom row.
- The mycelium on the right shows the area where the required space overlaps due to the smaller footprint of the huge red mushroom.
- The mushroom must be planted on adirt,grass,podzol,mycelium, ornyliumblocks (not shown).
- Placing blocks where the inside of a red mushroom would be does not hinder the growth of the mushroom substantially. Placing blocks directly in the way or outside of the mushroom prevents its growth.  Occasionally much taller (11+ blocks) mushrooms grow when blocked by blocks in the normal growth space below, however this is unreliable and takes significantbone meal.
- By placingdirtblocks around where the stem of the mushroom is supposed to be, you can block the light, allowing you to place the mushroom even closer to the surface. Then, fill up your tunnel and remove the dirt inside of the mushroom once it has grown.

Bear in mind that the huge mushroom may still attempt to grow at a taller height than space is available, failing and wasting a bone meal. It is therefore usually ideal to farm with the maximum space available (7×7×8), so that the bone meal can never fail.

### Huge mushroom farming
The basics of huge mushroom farming involve a 7×7×8 space and suitable ground. If you are outdoors, you can plant the mushroom using podzol, mycelium, or nylium. In the overworld, podzol is more easily available. To make podzol, plant a giant spruce tree with four saplings, and wait for it to grow. When it grows up, chop the tree down and use the newly formed podzol to plant a mushroom and bone meal it up. Planting consumes the underlying block, so you must occasionally regenerate by planting giant spruce again. (Mycelium can spread to the dirt, so no manual work is required.)

Another way to farm mushroom outside relies on timing: dig a 1×1 hole where you want your farm to be. Place water in the 1×1 hole. Then, plant a mushroom in the water and use bone meal on it quickly before the mushroom unplants.

In the nether, nylium is a good choice for growing huge mushrooms on. Note that you can spread nylium to adjacent netherrack blocks by using bone meal on the netherrack.

The extent of automation possible with mushroom farms is close to that of tree farms. You might be able to get some ideas from these harvesters. The bone meal input may require farming too.

## Small mushrooms
Because mushrooms do not grow on areas where the light level is greater than 12, the farmer must carefully consider the placement of light sources. Mushrooms are placeable everywhere but well lit areas or non solid / transparent blocks, and do not require water, sand, or extra space like crops, cacti or saplings.
However, even at night, they can be planted only on blocks where the light level would be less than or equal to 12. The exceptions to this are mycelium, nylium, and podzol, on which they can be planted and remain in full light. They can then spread slowly to other opaque blocks.

The main danger in small mushroom farming is that they must be low-lit indoor rooms, which poses the risk of hostile mobs spawning in the same area (except on Peaceful mode). This can be countered in several ways. The easiest way is to place copious numbers of soul torches, as they emit light level 10, which is dark-enough for mushrooms and lit-enough to prevent mobs.  Another way is to place normal torches two blocks above from where you want your mushrooms to grow (sometimes in tiny holes cut into the ceiling overhead). Another way involves making the farming area just one block high and paving any walkways with slabs and using a water system to channel the mushrooms out of the farm room and into a collection point. This removes most of the danger, since mobs cannot spawn on half-blocks or in one-block-tall areas and any other areas can be lit up. The Nether is a safe place to start a mushroom farm, since mobs there do not spawn in small spaces.
