## Skeleton farm
A skeleton farm can produce bones, which can be crafted into bone meal, as well as other stuff that skeletons drop, such as bows, arrows, and armor.You can also gain XP from them. For more information, read Tutorials/Spawner traps and Tutorials/Mob farm. A spawner trap is the most efficient, because only skeletons spawn:

1. Find adungeonwith amob spawnerthat spawnsskeletons, or build a dark place for the skeletons to spawn. Note thatzombies,creepers, andspiderscan spawn too in the latter option.
2. Make a water stream for the skeletons to fall down to where you want to kill them.
3. Kill the mobs yourself, with a mob grinder, etc. to get their drops and XP.

You may put a hopper below the block where the mobs die, so you can collect their drops and put them into a container, or an item sorter.

## Moss-based automatic bone meal farm
In both Java and Bedrock Editions it is possible to apply bone meal to a moss block and convert nearby stone into more moss blocks. These can then be composted to make a bone meal profit of between 2.5:1 and 3:1.

The moss can convert stone in a 7×7 area (minus the 4 corners) up to 5 blocks below the source moss block. It can also convert blocks up to 5 blocks above the source, but only where there is a connection of non-air and non-liquid blocks between the moss block and the stone platform above. In any case, only the highest block within the range can be converted. It is also necessary for the source moss block to have air above it for the bone meal to have any effect.

Any moss blocks that are formed, or indeed the source moss block, also have a chance to grow one of the following on top: azalea, flowering azalea or moss carpet. If a plant grows on top of the source moss block it must be cleared before the moss block can be bone mealed again.

To create an automatic farm, stone generators are used to replace the platform that is converted to moss. A mechanism is required to break any moss carpet that grow on top of the moss, usually flowing water or pistons, as this would otherwise prevent any further stone from being converted beneath the carpet. The moss block and other plant items can then be collected and composted. A recycling system is also required to ensure that the farm is self-sustaining in bone meal. 

## Nylium-based automatic bone meal farm

  

This tutorial is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition. 


In Bedrock Edition it is possible to make a profit from applying bone meal to crimson nylium. The nylium block produces crimson roots and crimson fungi in a 7×7 square area around the block that was bone mealed. Collecting these crimson plants and placing them in a composter on average yields a bone meal profit. This process can be automated by moving the crimson nylium platform with pistons to break the nether plants. The plant items can then be collected, typically using a water pickup system. from the top of the crimson nylium platform and fed into a series of hoppers above composters.
