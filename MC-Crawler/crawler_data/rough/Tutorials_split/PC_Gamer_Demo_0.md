# PC Gamer Demo
The PC Gamer Demo is a demo version of Java Edition Beta 1.3_01, that was bundled with the June 2011 issue of PC Gamer magazine (American edition, issue 214). It provides 100 minutes (equal to five days in-game) of gameplay, after which it tells the player to buy the game in order to continue playing on the current map. Only one splash is on the title screen: "PC Gamer Demo!"

## Features
The demo gives access to all the features found in the full version of the game, except that the player can access one world called the demo world. The demo world, which uses the seed glacier (or 108181935 when hashed), has been altered slightly to help guide newcomers to Minecraft. The demo spawns the player at x = 166, y = 65, and z = -57. 

The demo adds the following to the world:

- 54 redwool
- 90snow blocks
- 122 black wool
- 3chests
- asign
- 22gunpowder
- a nearly broken ironpickaxe
- a nearly broken ironaxe
- a nearly brokenflint and steel
- 4coal
- 5bread
- 4string
- 12torches
- 2sticks
- 3compasses

While the player cannot interact with most blocks, items, or mobs after the demo expires, they can still interact with existing boats, and can milk cows if they have a bucket.

The player's save game is saved in the standard game directory and is fully compatible with the full version, making it playable after purchase. The demo and information can be downloaded here.

The demo contains an exclusive cow skin branded with the PC Gamer logo.



## Changes
### General
** Controls **
- The new default hotkey for theinventoryisE.
- Shift+F2no longer creates a 36450Ã—17700 pixel screenshot.

## Bugs
- If the player's game window is at its smallest size at time of playing, upon enlargement of said window, all blocks become transparent until the mouse is moved or until the player interacts with their keyboard. This reveals all underground caves, thus revealing where ores and other valued blocks can be found without the need to dig.
- If the player opens two windows of the demo, one of them playing the world, but paused, and the other one, on the home menu, reset the demo world and then click back to game on the other window, an error message occurs, and if the player plays the demo, the time is reset, but not the world, and their inventory items are lost, but not the items in theblock entities.
