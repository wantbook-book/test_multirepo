### Deserts
Deserts and badlands are the other temperature extreme, often being barren, flat and seemingly inhospitable. With proper skill and adequate preparation, it can lead to a thriving base for those who can tough out some of the downsides.

Pros:

- Tons ofsandandsandstonebe found everywhere, a necessary resource forglass
- Badlands are the best place forterracotta, a building block that has a wide variety of uses
	- Red Sand can only be found naturally in Badlands, giving another reason to go there
	- The same goes withcactusfor both biomes
- The flat terrain and soft ground make flattening land and building various constructions an easy task
- Thunderstormsdo not make lightning here, turning them into unscheduled nights in these biomes.
	- Although, that does make gettingheadsandskeleton horsesimpossible without getting them elsewhere
- Desert pyramids,desert wellsand villages generate here, with the last one coming withcamels
- Badlands have high amounts ofgold oreandmineshaftsthat generate on the surface

Cons:

- No trees generate except on the edges ofriversand the tops of some badlands plateaus
- No animals exceptrabbitsspawn
- No grass generates outside of the rivers running through them
- The Badlands can have treacherous terrain to traverse at times
- The grass is a sickly yellow in the desert and olive green in badlands, both not looking the healthiest
- Incredibly far away from the cold biomes one may need

### Oceans
While these biomes aren't considered often, oceans aren't bad places to live, just requiring some extra precautions before settling down.

Pros:

- Shipwrecks,ocean ruins,ocean monuments, andburied treasureare all structures that generate here and give great amounts of loot
- Since all structures have to be above water,drainedorhabitable, the terrain below doesn't matter for the most part, giving a perfectly flat expanse to build on.
- Fishspawn constantly, acting as an easily obtainable source of food
- Onlydrownedcan spawn to attack you, with everything else being neutral orguardiansthat spawn only in one structure
- Fall damage is nowhere near as dangerous due to the fact water negates it, making building tall structures easier
- Water movement is faster than land movement, making them act as a crossroads of sorts
- Many items such ascoralorprismarineare available only here

Cons:

- Dry land nearly always has to be built by the player excluding frozen oceans
- Drowned armed withtridentspose a great threat for those not inside a structure
- Drowning poses a massive threat for those working in the area
- Aimless sailing can get somebody afflicted withMining Fatigue, a debilitatingeffectthat prevents anything more than a couple blocks worth of mining to be done
- Gathering materials such as ores is difficult due to mining speed getting reduced when submerged in water
- Getting lost is easy since there is next to nothing to keep track of

### Mountains
Even if they are painful to traverse, mountains have many reasons to live in them. The view is often second to none and various treasures can be found within.

Pros:

- Mining the tops of mountains gives massive amounts ofiron ingots,coal, and occasionallyemerald ore
	- This is best seen in stony peaks
- Powder snowcan be found easily in the snowy parts
- The view from high up is considered by many to be beautiful
- Trees from the Groves provide a good source of wood
- Cherry Groves provide beautiful flora and a unique wood type

Cons:

- Thedeep darkis often found below mountains, inhibiting mining at the bottom of the world to the point that a mine might have to be located elsewhere
- The terrain is dangerous, making long travel times and falling a large hazard
- Oceans may be hard to find nearby
- Flat terrain is hard to come by near the peaks, making it difficult to build constructions of a substantial size

### Swamps
Swamps and the variant mangrove swamp are incredibly different biomes for survival, but both may be interesting to live in.

Pros:

- Normal swamps have trees and animals needed for survival, while the mangrove swamp has incredibly high amounts of trees
- Boats allow for faster transport within these biomes since the water encompasses a large portion of the biome
- Lily padsand blue orchids are near exclusively found here
- The biomes are small enough to give access to things these biomes don't do well themselves
- Frogsare exclusively found here
- Slimesspawn at night, giving easy access toslimeballsat the small cost of a relatively easy enemy spawning

Cons:

- The water necessitates aboatbe kept on hand at all times
- Mangrove Swamps have foliage too dense for practically anything to be done, even worse than a jungle in that respect
- The grass color is a deep green and may be displeasing to some



## The Nether
The Nether is a different dimension that is altogether more hostile and dangerous for survival, with powerful mobs, difficult terrain, and an ever-present danger of lava falls and lava oceans. However, it offers many valuable items not found in the Overworld, as well as a unique and challenging survival experience.

Pros as a whole:

- The Nether possesses countless unique resources such asblaze powder,ghast tears, andmagma cream, many of which are instrumental in activities such as brewingpotions
- With enough effort, the Nether can be transformed into a canvas for a large amount of builds
- The bizarre scenery can be seen as appealing to some, especially when constructions are added to it

Cons as a whole:

- The majority of the Nether is filled withlava, making it extremely difficult to traverse without ender pearls
- Lava can also suddenly appear when searching for materials such as ancient debris, which can bring your demise if you don't react quick enough
- Hostile mobs such asmagma cubesare abundant in the Nether, which make it possible to be decimated easily without adequate preparation
