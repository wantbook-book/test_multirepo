# Tutorials/Mechanisms
Mechanisms are systems of blocks used to perform certain tasks, such as opening a door from afar or revealing a hidden staircase. These systems are built from simple components and normally involve some kind of user input, such as breaking a torch, which generates some kind of result, like a door being revealed. Mechanisms can range from simple switches that open and close doors from a safe distance, to complex devices such as combination locks that prevent intruders from entering your fort.

## Components
These are the basic, modular parts that can be combined to form any complex mechanism. Please note that individual items in the game are not considered components. Also, not all of these components have to be used when making a mechanism.

### Physical components
- Water Channel:A channel in which water can flow. Water is commonly used to breaktorches, causing things to fall, or washing away crops, as well as to transport items or mobs.

- Tube:A long three by three structure that can be used for launchingTNT.

- Piston Switch:Block 1 above ground level with redstone on top, with apistonthat moves across to stop circuit. Used so pressing abuttonorleverstops another circuit.

- Pipe: A pipe ofhoppersor clock-feddroppersused to transport items.

### Redstone components
See redstone circuits for an overview of simple components and advanced redstone circuits for more complicated redstone mechanisms.

## Mechanisms
Mechanisms are useful devices made from the combination of components. Here are some examples:

### Minecart storage system
This is a storage system that allows a user to call a minecart and return them.

### Potion dispenser
For this device, you can stand on a pressure plate and make splash potions shoot out of a dispenser. See the following steps for how to make it:

1. First, make adispenserdispensesplash potions. Then, place a dispenser one block over the floor level.
2. Place afenceon the side from which the dispenser shoots out the potion. Finally, putpressure plateson top of the fence.

### Vending machine
Vending machineÂ View at: Tutorials/Mechanisms/Vending machine [edit]
This is a customizable vending machine that is relatively easy to make. Unfortunately, it does require a lot of iron.

Notes:

1. The leftmost top hopper in the side view is the "input/output" hopper. Put items into this hopper and get items out.
2. The droppers hold the "purchase" items.
3. The chest at the bottom collects the "payment" items.
4. Fill the leftmost bottom hopper with 19-<price>items in the first slot, and 1 in each remaining slot. These items are payment items.
5. Repeat the upper-right 2 tall by 4 wide section upwards to add more items to the number purchased. (The number of droppers is this number.)
6. Delay the signal from the redstone torch to the hopper by 4*(price)-5 ticks (if the price is 1, simply don't delay it). The repeater here is showing 1 tick as an example.

### Hidden floor staircase
This is fairly easy to make. Below the floorboard's blocks, you put a face-up sticky piston that is powered when off, done by a redstone torch, and then the next block in the floor has a double-piston extender, also powered when off, and then a triple piston extender, and so on, so when the sticky pistons are powered off, then the blocks are pulled down into a staircase.
