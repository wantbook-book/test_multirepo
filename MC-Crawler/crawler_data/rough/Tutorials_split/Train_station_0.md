## The rail part
Main article: Tutorials/Minecarts
It might be a good idea to go over a few things about the rail first:

- Keeping Maximum Speed: On the mainrail, make sure that you have an activatedpowered railevery 32 blocks or, if you prefer fanciness over resource cost, you can use powered rails for the entire track. However, this requires much moreredstone, but definitely ensures that free carts do not slow down. If you possess vast quantities of redstone andgold, this isn't troubling.

A simple train station.
### Putting it together
The following flat-ground design, from left to right, has the following features:

- A station in the three nominally inactivated powered rails.
- Two "main" boosters, made up of a detector and 2 powered rails. The detector prevents backtracking. The spacing is determined by thetype of minecart.
- One "station mini" booster, made up of a detector and a single powered rail. The lower amount of powered rails prevents getting stopped by a second powered rail when the speed is insufficient to go clear of it before the detector unpowers.

## Compact Auto Minecart Station

The above video is a slight variation that of the first design, that uses lava instead along with pistons is available and does not rely on any glitches, thus is considered to be safe for use in the latest versions of Minecraft (1.6+). When the player arrives in a minecart, the minecart gets broken by the lava and collected by the hoppers while the player is pushed out of the exit using a glass block connected to a sticky piston. While slightly more redstone intensive than Sethbling's design (which was exceptionally simple), it does not have any problems associated with it and is thus recommended for anyone playing in 1.6+. If you are playing in Java Edition 1.5.2 or below (and not planning on updating), Sethbling's design is definitely better.

Here's a tutorial on how to build this design:

Another variation made by nmoleo64 uses a detector rail wired to a command block with the command /kill @e [type=MinecartRideable,r=2] to remove the minecart.

## Automated Single-Car People Mover Stop
The following video is a good example of a small station:

These designs are more complex and not as annoying. It is possible to minimize the number of powered rails used. Also, this can be implemented on any server, it doesn't require weeks of experimenting. This is recommended for beginners.

## 
The tripwire toggles the minecart between 2 different routes, the cart either moves in circles, awaiting a passenger. When a passenger is present, the tripwire activates and the cart moves in another route away from the station.

## Major Multi-Car Train Station
Note: This design requires lots of materials, so it is not recommended for a survival world that has been recently started. The design also uses a lot of redstone.

Here is how to make a working train station and powered rail system. It is most useful in multiplayer.

You need the following materials to build this station:

- 200+redstone dust(You may need more depending on how big it is).
- 64+gold ingots(Forpowered railsdepending on your decision).
- 100+iron ingots(Forrailsand tools).
- 1+stone pressure plate(s) (Usewooden pressure platesfor ticket collectors shown below).
- Lots ofwood(2 stacks or more).
- 500+ building material (cobblestone,stone,brick,dirt, etc...)

Note: all of these amounts may vary on the size of the station.

### Station Construction
The construction of the station is one of the most important parts. Firstly, determine the size and structure of your station. You can have a massive central terminal with many platforms and on top, have ferry piers and light rail and etc. or a simple humble station with a 5-car light rail. For the test experiment, the platform only fits 3 passenger cars. You can include luggage cars in front or at the back, but to build the platform, you need a large open area. Also, determine whether your platform is a side platform or an island platform. A side platform serves only one track while an island platform serves two tracks.

### Platform
Platform diagram.
Now, start the boarding area. The track below the platform are all powered rails. You should include extra powered rails beyond the platform for luggage cars. Before the platform, have another set of powered rails(not connected to platform track). Make a station box across from the platform with levers controlling both sets of powered rails, and place a station attendant here. Before the non-platform set of powered rails, have a room set into the side so another attendant can push the carts in an emergency.
