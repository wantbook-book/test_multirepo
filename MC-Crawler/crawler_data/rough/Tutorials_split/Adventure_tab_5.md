## 
Give a Pillager a taste of their own medicine

Requirements: Kill a pillager using a crossbow.

Use a crossbow to kill a pillager. This can be any crossbow, either crafted, dropped by mobs, bought or found in chests (see Ol'Betsy).

After you have obtained a crossbow, find a pillager (usually found frequently in pillager outposts and patrols), and kill it using your crossbow. You will need at least 3 arrows to do this. Alternatively, attack the pillager with melee attacks until it is on low health, and finish it off with a crossbow shot. You will then be awarded the advancement.

## Arbalistic
Kill five unique mobs with one crossbow shot

Requirements: Use a crossbow enchanted with Piercing IV to kill any 5 different mobs in one shot.

Kill five different mobs (for the purpose of this advancement, armor stand counts as a mob!) in one shot with a crossbow enchanted with Piercing IV, which allows arrows to hit five entities. Recommended mobs for this method are: pig, sheep, cow, villager and an armor stand. All of these have relatively large hitboxes, meaning they are hard to miss (unlike chickens or rabbits), but they still fit in a 1×1 area (unlike horses or donkeys). 

First, prepare a crossbow with Piercing IV (lower level will not work!) and an extended splash potion of Poison. Then look for a village in a plains biome: all needed mobs should be in proximity. Trap the villager first, as it is the hardest to move around. Any method works, as long as the villager ends in an 1×1 area, where it can't escape from. Drop the armor stand into the same spot, and lure a cow, a sheep (both are attracted to wheat) and a pig (attracted to carrots, potatoes or beetroots) from nearby plains. You can also use leads to make this easier.

Mobs prepared for a shot
Now, build a 4-high pillar next to the hole. Sneak and lean from its edge. Then, throw the potion of Poison at the mobs. This will reduce their health down to 1, but not fully kill them, which allows you to finish them off with the crossbow shot. You may want to bring a milk bucket, just in case you poison yourself.

After Poison wears off, load up your crossbow and shoot straight down at the mobs. If you did everything correctly, all five mobs will be killed with this shot, and you will get the advancement.

This is a hidden advancement, meaning that it can only be viewed when the player has completed the advancement.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 85 experience.

## Careful restoration
Make a Decorated Pot out of 4 Pottery Sherds

Requirements: Craft a decorated pot using 4 pottery sherds.

Craft a decorated pot using only pottery sherds: no bricks are allowed in this recipe. You can use any 4 pottery sherds, different or the same.

Sherds have a chance to be brushed from any naturally-generated suspicious sand or suspicious gravel, which are found in desert temples, desert wells, ocean ruins and trail ruins. The best places to look for sherds are probably desert temples, as they have 6-8 blocks of suspicious sand and, on average, 50% of them contain sherds.

Once you pull a decorated pot out of the crafting table, you will be rewarded the advancement.

Once you have been in every biome, you will be rewarded the advancement.

The player can check their progress by going to the Adventure tab and hover their cursor over the advancement. A progress bar will show how many of the 53 biomes they have visited. However, it does not show which of the biomes have been visited. You can create a notepad document and tick off biomes as you visit them, however there is a better method.

For a singleplayer world, a reliable way to check for which biomes have been visited is to read the .JSON file that stores the advancements. It involves the following steps:  

- Go to the.minecraftfolder >>saves>> (name of the world) >>advancements.
- Open the only available .JSON file in the folder with a text editor (e.g. Notepad).
- Find the entry that saysminecraft:adventure/adventuring_time.
- See which biomes are listed under the entry.

The file keeps a record of which biomes the player has visited, as well as the exact time that the player visited them for the first time. By reading this file, the player can learn of which biomes they need to visit in order to complete this advancement.

For a multiplayer server, you can't directly check the corresponding server's file, but you can use a client-side mod called AdvancementInfo, that lets you check which biomes you visited. It can be downloaded from this page.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 500 experience.
