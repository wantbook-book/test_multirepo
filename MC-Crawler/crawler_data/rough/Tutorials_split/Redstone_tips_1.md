## Construction
It can be helpful to choose a specific set of blocks the player uses to construct circuits. Then, when the player runs into these blocks during the excavation of new rooms in the base, the player knows they are about to damage a previously-built circuit. Common choices include stone bricks, snow block, wool and concrete. (Using different colors of wool and concrete is also a great way to keep track of different circuits)

Be cautious when building circuits near water or lava. Many redstone components will "pop off" (turn into items) when washed over by liquids, and lava will destroy any items it contacts.

Be careful when building circuits to activate TNT (traps, cannons, etc.). Circuits in mid-construction can sometimes briefly power up unexpectedly, which might activate TNT. For example, placing a redstone torch on a powered block, it won't "realize" that it should be turned off until the next tick, will therefore be powered for one tick, and can briefly power another part of the circuit during that one tick. Placing TNT after the rest of the circuit is complete will help to avoid such problems and the destruction of the device itself. This also applies to any other features of the circuit that may be accidentally activated with such actions (e.g., activating a dispenser before the circuit is ready).  Temporarily placing a redstone lamp or piston can quickly test whether a given space is powered.

### Color coding
This is a simple yet very effective tip, especially if you create redstone contraptions that have many different parts to them, such as comparator clocks mixed with other redstone items. It is best to use different colored wool, concrete, or terracotta for different parts of the circuit. If you build all the redstone using the same building block, for example, out of dirt (which you shouldn't be using for redstone anyway if you are in Survival because an Enderman may break it), soon you may completely forget how your redstone works due to not remembering where each circuit goes. Furthermore, this is important if you want to show off your redstone contraptions to others, so people can easily copy your design in their world. Additionally, color coding is helpful so you can go back to your project and understand what parts of the circuit perform what function.

If you don't want to use wool, concrete, or terracotta, you can find other blocks that are different colors from each other. For example, you can use stone variants and wood-related blocks. However, try not to use blocks of similar color, such as a block of coal and black concrete on 2 different parts of a circuit.  You can also use different colors or variants to mark switch-supporting blocks (input) or potential output locations for a circuit, e,g, if most of the circuit is built on stone brick, you might choose carved stone brick for switch blocks, polished granite for output locations, and diorite for mobile blocks.  Glass (which can also be tinted) can be used to display the workings of a circuit; it can also make sure that lava and water  (e.g., in a cobblestone generator) are visible but not open to unwary players.  

All this may take extra time and effort, but the benefits are worthwhile.

### Troubleshooting
When the circuit isn't working the way it should, take a look at it and try to find the problem. Work through the circuit and test various inputs to find where a signal is "dropped" or gained inadvertently.

- What part of the wiring actually is not behaving as expected?.  Unexpected output behavior is usually only a symptom, where the actual problem resides somewhere in the wiring.
- Are signals out of sync due to timing issues?
- Are parts of the circuit activating when they shouldn't be? Maybe accidentally "crossed wires" are allowing a signal from one part of the circuit to activate another part of the circuit, or a repeater's output is being cycled back into its input.
- Has the wiring been damaged by pistons pushing the wiring around?
- Trying to draw power from a weakly-powered block? Maybe a redstone repeater is needed to either strongly-power the block or to pull power out of it.
- Trying to transmit power through a non-opaque block? Replace it with an opaque block, or go around it.
- Was a short-circuit created and a redstone torch that should be powered is now burned out? Fix the short-circuit and update the torch to get things going again.
- Are pistons, dispensers, or droppers being indirectly powered when they shouldn't be?
- Is the circuit based on a tutorial from an older version of Minecraft which no longer works in the current version?
