# Tutorials/Egg farming
Egg farming is the process of collecting a large number of chicken eggs from chickens. From an automated source of eggs, a chicken farm which produces additional end products like raw/cooked chicken and feather can be constructed with the addition of egg-dispensing and chicken-killing systems.

The chicken is the most farmable animal in Minecraft. Unlike cows and sheep, it does not require any food to grow up or to reproduce. No matter where the chicken is kept, everything just happens automatically. In addition, cooked chicken is almost as good as other cooked meats for restoring hunger.

## Catching or hatching a chicken
In general, you'll want to first build a pen to hold them. Single-height wooden fences (or a small cave) will suffice, but either way it's best to add an "entry lock": a fenced space with gates leading both to the pen and to outside. This will help prevent escapees: if one of the gates is always closed, the chickens' pathfinding will never see an escape route to the outside.

The usual way to capture chickens is to hold seeds of any kind, which will make any chickens nearby follow you across the landscape and right into the pen. Alternatively, if you already have slimeballs and string, you can use leads to drag them along; this will mostly keep them from wandering away. You will need a separate lead for each chicken. With care, chickens can even be led across water, as they will follow your boat.

Another option is to collect eggs and throw the eggs into your closed pen. There is only a 1 in 8 chance of spawning a chicken when you throw an Egg, so you should try to collect at least one stack. They will take some time to grow to adulthood but once you have at least one adult chicken it will start producing eggs and with two or more adults you can breed them with any seeds.  Each adult chicken will lay an average of 8 eggs per hour.

When hatching large numbers of chickens, a good rule of thumb is that the chickens will need well over a real-time hour to replace the eggs used to hatch them. Nights skipped in a bed do not count toward this time, and the chunk(s) containing the chicken must remain loaded (that is, near a player or in the spawn chunks). This also assumes you are collecting all the eggs -- remember, loose items like eggs despawn after 5 minutes.

## Setting up the farm
You can farm chicken eggs the traditional way, where you have to run around and collect chicken eggs all the time.

Alternatively, you can follow one of the tutorials below, to create a farm that channels eggs to a single point. Most such will do the same for chicken meat, feathers, and even experience orbs as well.

### 3x3x4 Automatic Farm
This is a minimal egg farm consisting of 8 blocks, a hopper and chest: it's incredibly efficient in versions prior to 1.11, when it could house hundreds of chickens in an 1×1 area. Since version Java Edition 1.11's introduction of the maxEntityCramming gamerule, the number has reduced to 24. Check your servers settings on cramming before settling on this farm solution (this is not a problem on bedrock edition). Alternatively, you can place a single vines block in the space that the chickens occupy, and they will not suffer from entity cramming damage.

The opening at the top can either be used as a one-way entrance or simply sealed. Bait a chicken in or throw some eggs at the interior walls to start the system.

### Building up
This system may be extended with a larger living area with all hoppers eventually pointing to one that goes to a chest. At a certain point, the system becomes prone to mob spawns, and slabs can be laid over hoppers to deter mobs spawning. (Hoppers can fetch dropped eggs through a slab.) As using many hoppers becomes too expensive, water flow is used instead of the initial collection in the following version.

### 11x11x6 Automatic farm
The hopper egg farm is a relatively simple contraption, which does not require access to nether quartz: On the main floor, chickens are contained by water while they grow and lay eggs, which also wash the eggs into a hopper; from there the eggs go back into the system's supply chest. This chest feeds an automatic hatcher, which can refill the main floor after a harvest. The hatcher is controlled through a despawn timer, which prevents the system from spawning chickens ad infinitum (or at least until the server crashes).

This farm will be surrounded on the surface by an 11×11 fence or wall, with doors or gates at or near the middle of a side. There is a pillar and (at least a) partial roof in the center, and an "egg room" dug 3 blocks deep beneath that. The egg room and its pillar can be adapted to other farm layouts. You will also want a tunnel leading to the egg room, with space to get at the chest and other devices to retrieve meat and feathers), and the switches to trigger or disable the hatcher. The chickens are contained primarily by water, so the farm partly resists any problems with chickens walking through walls and fences. The schematics are below. The gold and stone-brick blocks represent "any full block", but the blocks shown as gold must also be opaque, while stone-brick blocks can be opaque, transparent, or in some cases air.
