# Tutorials/Navigation
It is easy to get lost in Minecraft while exploring or searching for resources, but a little forethought helps you stay oriented. This tutorial focuses on some of the easier ways of navigating Minecraft's landscapes.

## Spawn Points
Every world has a set spawn point where players are placed when they first enter the game, and each time they die (see below about beds). The world has one spawn point, and all players spawn within a few blocks of that point. (Formerly, single-player games had a specific spawn point, but now they use the same system as multi-player.) In multi-player, the area around the spawn point is "protected", so that only server operators can build or destroy blocks there. Making a base too close to a multiplayer spawn area can also expose it to griefing, so in multi-player it's usually better to move some distance before settling in.

Each player can change their individual spawn point by sleeping in a bed. In versions 1.16, using a charged respawn anchor in the Nether also sets your spawn point. If the bed is removed, destroyed, or blocked, the spawn point is lost, and the player respawns near their world's original spawn point. A world's original spawn point can be found easily using a compass. Additionally, as of 1.16, compasses can be set to point toward a lodestone.

Main article: Coordinates
In Java Edition, F3 opens the debug screen, which includes the player's current coordinates in the world. All three coordinates are measured in "blocks", which are considered equivalent to meters of distance. These coordinates are interpreted as follows:  X gives your distance east of the origin, and Z gives the distance south. Both of these can be negative, for positions west or north of the origin. The Y coordinate displays the altitude in meters, which is negative if seeing deepslate or in the rare case of falling through the void. Water level is at Y level 63. The spawn point is within a few hundred blocks of the map origin (X and Z of 0). The debug screen also shows what direction you are facing. It is displayed as North, South, East, or West. It is also displayed as a numerical value, though this is not always useful.

In Bedrock Edition, there is a world option that always shows the coordinates. They are measured in the same fashion as in Java Edition.

The simplest way to avoid getting totally lost is to write down the X and Z coordinates of your main base and other locations of interest. Then simply compare your current coordinates to the recorded coordinates and travel in the appropriate directions until the coordinates match. This method of navigation is particularly important for exploring the Nether. In Java, a convenient way to record coordinates in-game is to use F3 + C to copy your current position in teleport command form, then simply paste it in the chat (remove the /), optionally adding your own annotations. 

Do note that many servers have the reducedDebugInfo gamerule enabled, which prevents these coordinates from appearing in the debug screen.

## Above-Ground Navigation
### Directional Guides
Minecraft has an accurate system of cardinal directions.

- Thesunand themoonrise in the east and set in the west. Their paths are always the same, and they are fixed against the stars.
- The stars turn counterclockwise around the north pole and clockwise around the south pole.
- Clouds always float west, and are visible above-ground duringdayandnight.

### Trail Markers
You may want to build your main base away from the world spawn point, and in that case, it's a good idea to construct a series of landmarks to follow, especially if the path is long. The use of trail markers is far more resourceful and time-efficient than building long roads. Place all trail markers in such a way so you can always see two markers from the one you are standing at: the marker you came from, and the marker you are heading to. This prevents you from losing the trail. It is also advised to have the markers placed or designed in such a way that you always know which direction leads to the origin of the trail. Here are some methods of marking the trail:

- Torches: offer an easy method of making quick visible markers to follow, and they stop monsters from spawning nearby.
- Jack o'Lanterns:have a face that points in a single direction.

- Signs: Players may write directions and labels on these, including arrows. They don't glow on their own, but adding aglow ink sacwill make the text glow in the dark. (On a technical level, this does not produce light. So, players should use other light sources to prevent mob spawning.)

- Wool: A single color or combination can be used to identify the destination (different towns, buildings, or wholebiomes). Multiple colors can even show direction.
- Campfires: produce smoke that can be seen from a distance; placinghay balesunderneath the campfire increases the height of the smoke.
- Sand: Sand is easily mined, often plentiful, and very visible in most terrain. Placing another block on the ground near a tower of sand is an easy method of showing the right direction.
- Dirt paths: An ideal navigation block for marking a trail when exploring, requiring only a shovel.
- Arrows: simple arrows of off-colored blocks, such as a stone wall with a dirt arrow, can point the way.

- Pillars: Visible at a distance, can be made ofsnow, sand, stone, dirt, or other brightly-colored or reflective blocks, then lined with torches or capped withlavaor burningnetherrack. A quick way to make a tall pillar is to clean the leaves off one or more trees in the area of the landmark or perhaps along a route. No tools are required, and clearing the foliage can help to uncover the landmarks and create paths.

- Gate markers: Two blocks or towers placed next to each other with a one-block space between and an optional arch over the trail. The space between the blocks orients the player to the next gate. A torch or other marker can be placed on the side of one of the blocks to indicate the origin of the trail. It is usually best to build the markers out of something that stands out, like cobblestone or sandstone.

- Putting the base near avillagewith towers, adesert temple, or some other marker makes it hard to miss at a distance.
