## Purpose
Main article: Trading
Villager trading halls maximize the number of villagers that can be easily reached. They also provide a way to quickly discard unwanted villagers and replace the ones that are discarded. They can take the form of a literal "hall", with villagers lined up and waiting for the player to trade with them.

## Mechanics
There are three parts to a villager trading hall: the input, storage, and output.

### Input
The villagers for a trading hall generally come from a villager breeder. A source anywhere else is impractical given the amount of effort exerted to transport villagers out of a village. More advanced designs can include areas for players to reroll trades or permanently reduce their costs by zombifying and curing them.

For a fully automatic system, the mechanism that puts the villager into the hall must be able to close off the cell once the villager enters to prevent more villagers from entering that cell, and to open the next cell to allow for a villager to enter.

### Storage
Sometimes, the player will want to keep a villager because it has valuable or worthwhile trades. These villagers must be accessed, so they stay in separate "cells" until a better villager comes along; at which point the player may wish to discard them. They must be protected from zombies, lightning, and other things that could bring harm to them. The villagers must also have workstation blocks nearby, so that they can restock their trades.

### Output
A villager may come along with undesirable trades, or no trades at all. Also, a better villager might come along that would replace one that already exists in the hall. At this point, the player may wish to discard the villager, and the trading hall must provide a way to do so.

This discarding mechanism must be able to remove the villager from the cell and then open it up to allow for more villagers to drop in.

Once a villager is discarded, it is up to the player to do what they want with them. The most common thing to do is move the discarded villagers into one area, where they are killed by whatever means suits the player. It is not recommended to kill them manually, because that will lower the player's popularity, and if the popularity gets too low, any iron golems of that village become hostile toward that player. An alternative to killing the discarded villagers is to store them for an iron golem farm, put them into a village, or put them to work in farms and breeders.

## Locking in trades
Once a fresh villager has been placed into their new spot in the hall, it is possible to lock in a trade that is desirable. To lock them in, simply trade with them. If a trade is undesirable, reset trades by breaking and replacing the villager's job block. This can be done as often as needed until a satisfactory trade is offered at a good price. Once a villager has traded once, they will keep that trade forever. If you do not lock them in, their trades will reset every few minutes.

## Useful villagers
Main article: Villager
- Butcher– Butchers buy raw meat for emeralds, which is useful if you have animal farms. They also buy dried kelp blocks and sweet berries, easy-to-farm items. They sell cooked meat, which is useful if you don't want to use your coal, wood, or lava for cooking food.
- Farmer– Farmers buy crops for emeralds. The best starting trades are carrots and potatoes, because using fortune on the crop gives more carrots and potatoes respectively. This doesn't work on wheat or beetroot, as it only drops more seeds. They can also buy pumpkins and melons, which can be farmed automatically without using villagers. The apples some sell at apprentice level can be converted into golden apples, for use in curing villagers or as a defensive panic button for players. Master level farmers will sell golden carrots and glistering melons, providing valuable potion ingredients without the need for players to dip into their own gold reserves.
- Fisherman– To a beginning player, a fisherman's trades can be expensive, such as the villager buying coal and string for emeralds. However, they can cook fish for you and sell campfires. A master level fisherman will buy a boat for an emerald, meaning that 2 logs can get you an emerald. Also, 3 emeralds can be used to buy a bucket of cod. A bucket is worth much more than 3 emeralds. They can even sell an enchanted fishing rod.
- Librarian– Until you have a goodsugarcane farm, the librarian's paper trade won't be worthwhile. However, one librarian can sell up to 3 enchanted books, which can be useful early game. You can enchant tools with an anvil, or disenchant them to get bonus experience. Their utility can last or even increase well into the late game, as their enchanted books can be a renewable source of treasure enchantments or other enchantments that are difficult to obtain consistently, such asThornsIII. At journeyman level they provide an easy source of glass, which a player can take for decoration, or, if they have large enough discounts, craft into panes and bottles and sell to cartographers and clerics respectively at a profit.
- Cleric– Clerics sell exotic items, such as redstone, lapis lazuli, glowstone, and bottles of enchanting. They buy rotten flesh, which is a good way of getting rid of your accumulated rotten flesh or if you have a pigman/mob farm. Clerics aren't a very good source of emeralds, especially in the early game, due to the difficulties associated with farming gold and nether wart. Furthermore, selling gold to clerics diverts it from potential use in bartering farms.
- Stone Mason– Stone masons buy clay, stone, and other rocks. This is an easy way to get emeralds especially if you have a Silk Touch pickaxe. Quartz is another good item to trade with if you have a Fortune III pickaxe. However, don't trade too much of the decorative stones if you have any use for them, as they are hard to farm until you have a bartering farm since you need quartz to craft they. Clay isfarmablerelatively easily using mud and dripstone (since 1.19). If you don't have a clay farm or dyes, stone masons can also sell colored or glazed terracotta for decorative use.
- Shepherd– Shepherds have one of the cheapest job site blocks. They sell one colored wool for 1 emerald, and you have a chance of getting brown, black, or white wool, which you need to give the villager 18 to get one emerald. Their best use would be buying shears, which cost 2 emeralds. You can also sell dye, which is easy to obtain if you have a large supply of bonemeal or a flower or even squid farm.
- Leatherworker– Leatherworkers generally offer bad trades, selling leather armor for an expensive price. However, they will sell a saddle at master level, and they are a good way to offload excess leather, which can be particularly useful if you have cow or hoglin farms which produce it as a byproduct.
- Cartographer– Cartographers buy paper and glass panes. Glass panes are easy to get if you have a auto smelter and a highly enchanted shovel. They also sell banner patterns, and explorer maps.
- Fletcher– Fletchers are a good source of low-cost emeralds, because fletchers buy 32 sticks for one emerald. That is, four logs crafted into sticks can get you one emerald. They also sell arrows, enchanted bows, and crossbows.
- Blacksmith– The three professions below belong in this category. They buy the same things coal, iron, diamond, and lava, and they all sell bells. In the early game they can't be depended on for getting emeralds, since coal and iron are hard to farm, lava is only renewable since 1.17, and diamonds aren't renewable. If you do have an iron farm, however, these villagers can become a strong supplier of emeralds.
	- Toolsmith– Sells stone, iron, and enchanted diamond tools. They always sell an enchanted diamond pickaxe at master level.
	- Weaponsmith– Sells iron and enchanted diamond swords and axes.
	- Armorer– Sells iron, chainmail, and diamond armor. The diamond armor is enchanted, and you will get up to two different pieces. Chainmail boots and helmets cost one emerald. When combined with the fletcher's stick trade, or the fisherman's boat trade, you can convert 2-4 wood logs into iron by selling a boat or 32 sticks for an emerald, then buying chainmail boots/helmet and smelting it into a nugget.
