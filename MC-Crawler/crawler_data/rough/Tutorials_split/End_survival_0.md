## Prerequisites
Before continuing, please note that this page assumes that the player has already killed the ender dragon. If they have not done so, then it is strongly suggested for them to do, as it is extremely difficult to survive in the End with the ender dragon alive. (If they need help to do so, see Tutorials/Defeating the ender dragon). It also assumes that they are playing on Easy difficulty or above because playing in Peaceful makes it far less challenging than on other difficulties.

The End is less dangerous than the Nether, however, the player can die quickly without proper equipment.

Upon entering the End, the player is recommended to open as many gateways to the outer islands as possible for maximum efficiency in transportation, covering ground, and gathering the resources of each island. The gateways generate a maximum of 20, with new ones being created every time a respawned ender dragon is killed by the player.

The first dragon gives the most experience to the player, and is the most difficult to defeat. The first dragon can be defeated only with resources the player has brought to the End, but after the first gateway is generated, it allows the player to set up an outpost on the outer End islands. There, the player can bring:

- Saplingsand dirt forfarmingand growingtrees(providing building material, charcoal for torches and smelting needs, and much more)
- 2 waterbucketsfor pools to stay safe fromendermen,fishing(which still works in the End)
- compostersto synthesize bonemeal (wheat and beetroots are great for growing in the end, as they always leave more seeds than the player needs and feed the composter with these. Cocoa beans are the most efficient plants for feeding a composter)
- lava for a cobblestone generator.
- Optional: abrewing standto brew potions for combat while the player takes a recovery break and bamboo for easy scaffolding structures. However, unlike the above-listed items, potions are not renewable in the End (scaffoldingis renewable as it requiresbamboo, which can be grown indefinitely under enough light level, or bone meal andstrings, which can be obtained as a junk item fromfishing) and require the player to import the necessary materials from theOverworldandthe Netherbeforehand.

Once a base of this sort has been set up, and the player has a sufficient amount of ender pearls to teleport through the gateway, they can take a break from the battle at any time. The player can respawn the ender dragon—only this time, if the player has been sufficiently damaged, rather than dying they are able to teleport to the outpost to eat, recover, and—if they wish—brew potions and acquire new building materials as needed. The player can then teleport back through the gateway to return to battle the Ender Dragon at full health (see "pros" of living in the end for a list of all the renewable resources, combat gear, and food the player can bring with them into the End).

## Pros and cons of living in the End
### Pros
- It has only two mobs after the defeating of theender dragon:endermenandshulkers.
- It has a lot of empty space for building.
- It is flat and easy to see across.
- It has a large amount ofobsidian, and an unlimited amount ofender pearlsand an unlimited amount ofend stone, with the ability torespawnthe ender dragon.
- Unlikethe Nether, it can have bothwaterandlavain it for cobblestone. The player can also grow trees and crops.
- The player can go to the outer islands, where they can findchorus fruits,chorus plantsandend city-related things.
- The End is the only place where the player can find anend ship, where they can get theelytra, an extremely useful item used for flying. It is also the only source of the invaluable resource ofshulker shells.
- On servers, it is usually the least heavily-trafficked dimension. Most people live primarily in the Overworld and use the Nether for rapid transport, leaving The End quiet.
- Finally, The End can be made to be like the Overworld, and can be set up to provide infinitely renewable sources of almost everything the Overworld has. This includeswater,iron, food,trees,stone(and its variant of cobblestone),bone meal, all resources collected from animals (including honey, wool and meat), and all resources collected from Villagertrading(includingglass,glowstone,redstone dust,lapis lazuli,Bottle o' Enchanting,bowsandarrows—which aren't much use in the End, but are still available—armor,tools,enchanted books,stonevariants,block of quartz, and more. See "Farming" section for how to gain access to these).

### Cons
- A player falling into theVoiddies and lose allitemsunless the gamerule to keep inventory is enabled.
- Endermen spawn infinitely; no matter how many they have killed, there are always more until players light the area sufficiently.
- If players want to survive, they have to bring a lot of stuff with them that would otherwise be inaccessible unless they have anender chest.
- Bedsandrespawn anchorsdon't work and they explode and set fire to the area around the player if that player attempts to sleep in one or set their spawnpoint with one.
- Players without either boots withFeather Fallingor apotion of Slow Fallingrisk falling to their death aftershulkerattacks.
- Nether portalsdon't work in the End.
- The few players visiting the End often travel many kilometers in search of end cities, and likely take any loot they find there.
