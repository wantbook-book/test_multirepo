### Semi-Automatic Farming
1. Lay downredstonein lines with 2 blocks in between each line 15 blocks long. Attach a button to this circuit. Fill the spaces in between the lines with sticky pistons. Placedirton top of everything (pistonsand redstone). Place a piston circuit to allow water to spill forward like in the original design. Attach aleverto this circuit. Adjust circuits as needed for length.
2. Place seedmushroomson the dirt on top of theredstone.
3. Press button to dislodge mushrooms, then flip theleverto havewaterbring them down to you. Repeat the design down a hallway, raising the floor one time with each repetition. Allow the water to spill into a central channel and bring the mushrooms to you.

### Fully-Automatic Mushroom Farming
#### Using water dispensers and a light sensor circuit
In the following design, mushrooms are planted on central platforms and new mushrooms spread to side platforms. Water flows once a day through the side platforms delivering the newly-spread mushrooms to hoppers and finally into chests.

On the central platforms, mushrooms can be planted in packs up to four mushroom of each kind. Planting more mushroom increases the spreading speed, but also reaches its cap limit sooner. In the video (that is unlinked in any form), three mushroom of each kind are planted, as it gives higher daily output.

The side platforms should be one block high to improve efficiency. The central platforms should be 3 blocks high. 
In the video (that is unlinked in any form), the central platform uses glass blocks, as mushroom can't spread over glass.

A circuit, using a daylight detector, emits two delayed pulses once a day. Activating and deactivating dispensers containing water buckets, making water flow through the side platforms for about 12 seconds. Enough to deliver every new mushroom spread in the side platforms to a hopper collection point that eventually stores the mushrooms into chests.

The farm can be covered in glass, if the platforms are built in mycelium. They can also be covered with any other non-transparent block.

#### Using pistons
A simple fully automated mushroom farm can be built with the use of pistons. 

First, a room of the height 2 is needed, in this room, place a water stream in the floor, 2 blocks wide. It transports the mushrooms out of the room. Mushrooms should be planted along the bank of the water, leaving every other block empty. Lastly, pistons are required to be placed facing toward the water stream. They need to be placed beside the blocks, where no mushrooms are planted.

The pistons need to be wired to an outside switch, the water stream shall be redirected to your favorite collection point. Then, the room needs to be sealed to be completely dark. The only opening should be 1×1 wide, for the water stream. This being the only opening, spawned monsters cannot leave the room. Eventually, the mushrooms spread to the blocks in front of the pistons. Activating the pistons then harvests the mushrooms and push them into the water stream. The system is reset by deactivating the pistons without any need for replanting.

Higher efficiency can be achieved by multiple arrangements. The system can even be arranged in a room of the height 1, this makes setup more difficult though.

#### 
The idea here is that mushrooms can also be popped off by causing the block beneath them to change to glass. Using pistons, you can push 12 blocks of alternating block/Glass rows causing any mushrooms growing on them to pop off.


The basic set up is two sets of pistons facing each other on either side of the seed mushroom row. Upon pushing a button a signal is sent causing the first group to extend popping off the mushrooms. The signal is delayed 12 ticks (3 repeaters) and the second group of pistons then extends resetting the farm.

Generally this is designed for use in the Nether, where “wet" methods are unavailable. Some benefits over other "dry" methods are simplicity and low resource requirements.
