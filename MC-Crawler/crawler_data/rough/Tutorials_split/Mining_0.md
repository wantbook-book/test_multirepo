# Tutorials/Mining
Mining is essential to a player's progress in Minecraft. It allows players to gather resources to upgrade their armor, tools, weapons, and much more. Yet, it can be dangerous and time-consuming if not done well. 

Below are some tips provided by the community for performing this underground work.

The single best layer for mining is highly debated and is not agreed on.

Layers 10 to 15 are usually considered the best levels to start mining for players seeking the safest layers where all ores exist in reasonable quantities (especially diamond). This is especially true prior to Caves and Cliffs Update, before the world height was expanded and the ore vein generation was redistributed. Post Caves and Cliffs, deepslate layers between -59 to -54 have the best chances for players seeking diamonds and redstone.        

Using the debug screen (F3) (Java Edition exclusive) or coordinates (Bedrock Edition setting) is the easiest way to find the player's altitude. The player can also look for lava pools, all air blocks between Y=-63 and -55 are turned to lava during world generation. (Mining at this layer ensures that the floor remains intact if they pour water). The player can even find and stand on the uppermost layer of bedrock, then climb up 6 blocks. 

Once they have located their desired layer, they can begin mining using one of the techniques listed below.

## Preparing to mine
Before players mine, it is recommended to bring food, wood, torches, weapons, and a water bucket. 

Players may want to bring a bed if they are spending several days underground, so they do not have to go back to their house to sleep. 

Wood can be converted into sticks which takes less inventory space. However, some players may opt for a stack of sticks or two as they can quickly be crafted into a pickaxe, torch, sword, etc. if one is in dire need of one. 

A clock is also very helpful because you can tell when it is daytime to safely return to the surface. 

Also, if the player has spare iron, it's recommended to bring iron pickaxes instead of stone pickaxes as they mine faster and have higher durability. If the player is looking for obsidian, then they need to have a diamond pickaxe. 

If mining in the Nether, bring a few fire resistance potions or at least splash potions of water (water from a water bucket evaporates), as well as all the previously mentioned thing things. Be careful of beds in the Nether and End dimensions as they explode like TNT. Some players use this mechanic to quickly and cheaply mine for resources (particularly for ancient debris). Also, you should record the coordinates of your portal, so that you don't get lost. The last helpful tip for the Nether is to bring a piece of gold armor, as wearing it will keep piglins (except piglin brutes) from attacking you.  

Getting lost in a cave without food may result in starvation. Without a weapon, the player will be defenseless from the large number of mobs that spawn in the darkness underground. A shield is also a good way to protect yourself in the dark.

Some good weapons are a sword, trident, or bow, as these provide the best attack or the best durability. Swords have less attack than a trident, but much more durability, a bow is very good for range, and has a good durability, but as you are in a closed area, it may not be as good, and a trident can be both ranged and melee with a lot of attack power.

If players are prone to losing the way back or simply want to be safer, try marking their path with torches or another unique block, such as signs, wood planks or wool. This also helps them to recover their items if they die. Carving out a safe room containing furnaces, a crafting table, a bed and a chest might be well worth their time. If they spend lots of time underground, they may want to bring resources for a more sophisticated base with.

Lava is highly dangerous and becomes quite common on lower levels, so remember to bring two water buckets when mining. Two buckets allow the player to create an infinite water source to replenish their water supply. Dig a 2×2 hole and place water in two opposing corners and now they have infinite water. This can also be done by placing water at both ends of a 3×1 hole. This can help the player get to ores above lava. Just place the water next to the lava source, and the water will convert the lava blocks on top of the pool to obsidian. In the nether, this will not work, as you cannot place water, so it is a good idea to make a fire resistance potion, as that will negate all fire damage, and as there are many lava pockets hidden in the wall, as well as giant lava seas, it will help.

Armor is essential for reducing the damage taken by hostile mobs and lava.

There are three basic ways to start off the mine, though they can be combined:

1. Find one of the many caves that opens to the surface, and start exploring that, generally working the way downwards. Even shallow caves offer plenty of coal and iron, and later gold and other ores. Caves offer the advantage that a great deal of stone has already been excavated for the player, exposing many blobs. On the flip side, they often contain a large amount of hostile mobs, and both water and lava can be troublesome.
2. If, rather than a proper cave entrance, having a shaft orravine, players can start with that. Use awater bucketto create a waterfall that they can swim down (and back up), (or you can just MLG if you want) then continue as above with the caves that open off the ravine. Watch out for monsters falling off high ledges. The player may want topillar jumpto light those ledges and look for high tunnels.
3. Alternatively, players can make their own entrance to mine. You dig a vertical or diagonal mineshaft wherever is convenient such as a back room in the base, and start digging horizontal shafts at suitable depths. This takes more tools (since the player is digging everything out themselves), but with proper lighting, they will hardly ever see monsters. Their mineshaft probably will also open into caves, which they can explore as above. There's a good deal of discussion about which methods are best for mining ores, but for the initial mineshaft, the safest method is probably a 1×3 shaft equipped with a ladder down the middle, and occasional ledges in case the player falls off the ladder. Regardless of how the player arranges things, they need to light the shafts properly to avoid monsters being spawned. The player can also turn to mineshafts when the cave is mined out. It is a good idea to mine everything out including coal as the player never knows when they might be lost and need more torches.
