Have an Allay drop a Cake at a Note Block

Requirements: An allay must drop a cake at a note block.

First, get two cakes and a note block. You can craft them like so:

| Name       | Ingredients                                | Crafting recipe |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Cake       | Milk Bucket+<br/>Sugar+<br/>Egg+<br/>Wheat |                 |
| Note Block | AnyPlanks+<br/>Redstone Dust               |                 |

Alternatively, cakes can be bought from some farmer villagers, and note blocks can be found in ancient cities.

Next, you must find an allay (see You've Got a Friend in Me). Once you find the allay, give it a cake (use the allay with the cake). Place down the note block and use it; if the allay is close enough, small particle will travel from the note block to allay, indicating that the mob noticed its new destination block. When that happens, drop the other cake on the ground. Allay will fly to it, pick up the cake, then fly to note block and drop the cake. When the cake is dropped, you should get the advancement.

## A Complete Catalogue
Tame all cat variants!

Requirements: Tame at least one of all of the 11 different cat variants.

You will need to tame at least 11 cats. Each cat on average takes two raw cod or raw salmon to get tamed, so prepare about half a stack of these. Raw fish are usually obtained from fishing or killing fish mobs. 

You need to tame all cat variants in the game. To tame a stray cat, you have to hold the raw fish in your hand, then slowly approach it. Cats will flee from you if you get too close, approach too quickly, or even move the camera too much, so you should slowly sneak toward the mob with minimum camera movement. Eventually, the stray cat will start crawling toward you as well. Once it comes to a stop in front of your feet, use it with the fish several times until red hearts appear on top of the cat, showing that it is now tamed. 

Each cat variant has a different appearance and a different name:

- "Black" (black with orange eyes)
- "British Shorthair" (silver with yellow eyes)
- "Calico" (orange, white and dark brown with yellow and blue eyes)
- "Jellie" (gray and white with gray-green eyes)
- "Persian" (creamy with blue eyes and flat faces)
- "Ragdoll" (white and soft amber with blue eyes)
- "Red" (orange and white with green eyes)
- "Siamese" (white and pale brown with blue eyes)
- "Tabby" (brown and white with yellow eyes)
- "Tuxedo" (black and white with green eyes)
- "White" (white with light blue and yellow eyes)

Cats only spawn in villages and swamp huts. A swamp hut always spawns one black cat, along with a witch. For a village to spawn a cat, there needs to be at least 5 villagers and 5 beds, so make sure to increase the villager population if it's not big enough. A maximum of 5 cats can spawn in one village; if you tamed all cats in one village, either move them far away so that more stray cats can continue to spawn here, or pick another village. 

Black cats are the only ones with special requirements to spawn: it can happen only in swamp huts or during full moon.

Once you successfully tame all 11 cat variants, you will be awarded the advancement. Completing this advancement will reward the player 50 experience.

## Tactical Fishing
Catch a fish... without a fishing rod!

Requirements: Catch a fish with a water bucket.

Prepare a water bucket. You need a live fish: they are naturally found in any aquatic biome. This includes oceans, rivers and aquifers in lush caves. Use the water bucket on any type of fish; if you accidentally empty your bucket instead of catching the fish, you need to fill it again with water before next attempt. Once you have obtained the bucket of fish (a bucket of cod, bucket of salmon, bucket of pufferfish, or a bucket of tropical fish), you will be rewarded the advancement.

## When the Squad Hops into Town
Get each Frog variant on a Lead

Requirements: Use a lead on all three variants of frogs at least once (they do not have to be leashed simultaneously!).

This advancement can be performed in parallel to With Our Powers Combined.

You need to get yourself at least one lead. You can craft it like so:

| Ingredients           | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| String+<br/>Slimeball | 2               |

Leads also generate in chests in ancient cities and woodland mansions, and can be brushed from suspicious gravel in trail ruins. Also, a naturally spawned wandering trader always spawns with two trader llamas attached to it via leads. When they are detached, leads drop as an item on the ground.

When you obtained leads, you need to leash all three variants of a frog: a temperate one (orange), a warm one (white) and a cold one (green). First two can spawn naturally in swamp and mangrove swamp biomes, respectively; there is a very small chance that a green frog spawns naturally when one of those biomes border a snowy biome. However, a better method of getting frog variants is to grow them by yourself.

When you find your first frogs, leash one of them: use a lead on the frog. You can then unleash it immediately (use again). Then, breed two frogs with slimeballs. One of the frogs will then lay frogspawn on a nearby block of water. Wait 10 minutes until it hatches and catch at least two tadpoles (see Bukkit Bukkit above).

Next step depends on which type of frog you found first. If you found an orange one, you will now need a warm biome, like a desert. If you found a white one, go to a moderate biome, like plains. Complete list of biomes in all three categories can be found here.

Dig one block in the ground and place tadpole in the hole. Wait until it grows up. This takes 20 minutes, but the time can be sped up by feeding slimeballs to the tadpole. After time has passed, tadpole grows up into an adult frog: there is a chance that this happens in such a way that the frog will immediately start suffocating. To prevent such an event, you can use a 3×3×3 glass cube with tadpole inside (mobs do not suffocate in glass), like so:

A cage preventing frog from suffocation
When you have the second frog type, leash it. Repeat a similar procedure in a cold biome, like snowy plains: note that water freezes in these biomes, so you need to either encase it with the glass cage, or put a strong light source nearby. When you leashed all frog types, you will get the advancement.
