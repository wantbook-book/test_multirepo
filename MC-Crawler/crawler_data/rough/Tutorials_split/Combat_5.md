#### Vexes

See also: Vex

Vexes are very small creatures about the size of a baby zombie. They can only be summoned by evokers. Vexes float around, passing through all blocks and deal melee damage with iron swords: 5.5 × 2.75 on Easy, 9 on Normal and 13.5 × 6.75 on Hard. They have 14 × 7 points of health.

Killing vexes in one hit should be relatively easy due to their low health, however their unpredictable movement and phasing through block makes this much more difficult. Using a sword is recommended, as you need to be fast. In Java Edition, some ways to achieve the one-hit kill include:

- Netherite sword + Sharpness IV + critical hit;
- Strength I + netherite sword + Sharpness V;
- Strength II + diamond sword + Sharpness I.

Proritize killing evokers over vexes: evokers constantly spawn new vexes if you don't deal with them.

After some time after they are summoned, vexes slowly lose health and die‌[Java Edition  only].

#### Pillagers

See also: Pillager

Third type of an illager. They spawn in 3 ways: in illager patrols, at pillager outposts and during raids. They hold a crossbow which is sometimes enchanted. Pillagers shoot their crossbow at the player up to 6 blocks away every 2 seconds, and can sometimes be dangerous, especially in groups. The player needs to be careful when encountering a pillager armed with an enchanted crossbow with Multishot as it fires 3 arrows at once‌[Java Edition  only].

To avoid fighting pillagers it is best to stay away if you don't have any armor to protect yourself. If you're forced to fight, strong weapons are recommended. A shield can stop the pillager's arrows if successfully timed, unless the pillager has Piercing on its crossbow. Blocking an attack and counter-attacking while the pillager is reloading is an effective strategy. Pillagers can be killed in one hit in the same ways as vindicators. A bow or crossbow can help kill pillagers from a safe distance.

During raids, killing pillagers has the lowest priority, as they are the weakest mob spawning in all waves.

Upon killing a pillager, they drop arrows‌[Bedrock Edition  only], sometimes a crossbow and an ominous banner if the pillager is the raid captain. Keep in mind that killing a raid captain directly inflicts you with Bad Omen effect; if that's not something you want, but you still need to kill the captain, use an indirect method of damaging it, like a lava bucket.

#### Illusioners

This tutorial is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


Fourth type of an illager. They can't be spawned in Survival mode, and must be summoned by the player(s) using commands.

Illusioners have 32 × 16 of health and can't be killed in one melee hit (using weapons and buffs obtainable in Survival). They use a bow and two magic attacks: casting Blindness on you for 20 seconds and spawning duplicates to fool you. These duplicates move in the same way as the regular mob, but real illusioner becomes temporarily invisible.

Due to it dealing poor damage, illusioners are more of a nuisance than danger. It's recommended to use a bow for this mob, search where real arrow comes and hit in that direction until you find the real illusioner. When you are blinded, it's best to back away, waiting for the Blindness to disperse, then attack again. You could also drink a milk bucket to remove the Blindness. Splash potions of harming are another good strategy: they deal area damage and kill the illusioner in a few hits without having to search the real illusioner.

Yet another very good strategy to kill illusioners is to hook them with a fishing rod, and then put the rod in your offhand. Bobber indicates the position of the illusioner, even when it becomes invisible.

#### Ravagers

See also: Ravager

A bull-type mob, they only spawn on raids, starting from the third wave. They are sometimes being ridden by vindicators‌[Java Edition  only], pillagers or evokers. They have the same amount of health as an iron golem (100 × 50) and are very dangerous to face in combat as they have a powerful attack if the player gets too close. Their attack on Hard difficulty can almost instantly kill the player, as it deals 18 × 9 if they don't have armor. Ravagers can also destroy crops and leaves in their path as they chase their prey. Ravagers are quite fast, which means the player may have a hard time escaping them. Beacon effects such as Resistance, Strength and Regeneration may help defeat ravagers slightly easier.

If possible, stay far away from ravagers while the wave of a raid is in effect. Killing them with a ranged weapon is recommended: a bow with Power V takes 5-6 arrow shots to defeat a ravager. If a ravager is unaccompanied by other mobs, you can dig down two blocks and then hit it with a sword. You can also hide in a village house and open the door. Then, when ravager charges in front of the building, you can hit it then hide inside, since ravagers are about two blocks wide. These methods are better resource-wise, and if you don't want your shield or arrows to be consumed fighting a ravager. However, keep in mind that ravagers have a long range, and in past versions they could even hit through walls.

In melee combat, you should equip strong diamond or netherite armor. A shield can help if you can time the blocking right; however, after being stunned by a shield, there is a 50% chance for the ravager to stop for a moment to growl and roar. This deals 6 damage and knocks you back. After that, they continue to chase again. If the ravager is stunned and about to roar, you have enough time to hit it twice with a sword before it roars.

Since you will likely be encountering a ravager in a village during a raid, you may want to employ the iron golems. With your help, a single iron golem can survive against a couple ravagers.

It's recommended killing the illager rider first before killing the ravager, as a combination of those two mobs is very dangerous.
