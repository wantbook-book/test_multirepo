# Tutorials/Axolotl farming
Axolotl farming is a way to collect axolotls. Two basic methods of farming axolotl are available: breeding and natural spawning.

## Locating lush caves
Axolotls only spawn in the lush caves biome. These biomes can be hard to find, but some knowledge about biome generation in Minecraft can make it a lot easier.

The easiest way to find a lush caves is of course to dig down under an azalea tree. However, azalea trees do not always generate above lush caves, making some lush caves harder to locate. Luckily, azalea trees are not the only above-ground indicators for lush caves; the type of surface biome can also give out valuable information.

Lush caves only generate under biomes with high humidity values. These include temperate biomes such as dark forests and birch forests, warm biomes such as jungles and wooded badlands, and cold biomes such as taiga, old growth taiga, and snowy taiga. A few biomes, in particular, are almost guaranteed to have lush caves below them:

- Dark Forest
- Bamboo Jungle
- Old Growth Taiga
- Wooded Badlands

These biomes have the highest humidity values in the game, high enough so that lush caves always try to generate below them. The only case where there might not be lush caves below, is that dripstone caves generate instead. This occurs when the dark forest or bamboo jungle or wooded badlands or old growth taiga generated far inland. This can be easily predicted, because dripstone caves only generate far away from the ocean. This means that if you find a dark forest, bamboo jungle or old growth taiga or wooded badlands close to the ocean, it is absolutely guaranteed that there's a lush caves biome below you!

## Breeding
Breeding adult axolotls requires buckets of tropical fish. This a time-consuming manual effort. Feed two axolotls to put them into love mode, after which a baby axolotl spawns. The parents have a "cooldown" period of 5 minutes in Java Edition or 1 minute in Bedrock Edition before they can be bred again. The baby axolotl has a 1‚ÅÑ1200 chance to be blue, otherwise it inherits the color of one parent. A baby becomes an adult in 20 minutes (or sooner if you feed it), after which it can breed.

Once you have a blue axolotl, you can breed it to gain more blue ones, because each new baby has a 50% chance of inheriting the color of one parent.

### Considerations
The problems with breeding are time and resources. Because you need to breed axolotls many times before getting a blue one, you need many tropical fish. Consequently you need many buckets, which in turn require many iron ingots to craft, or many emeralds to buy buckets from fisherman villagers. Some advanced items to make things easier are:

- Ahelmetenchanted withRespirationIII, and boots enchanted withdepth strider
- Achestfull ofshulker boxeshelps keep your inventory of buckets manageable.
- Aconduitallows you to breathe and see better underwater for the purpose of hunting tropical fish and breeding axolotls.
	- With a conduit, the Respiration III helmet is optional.

### Location and breeding pen
Because buckets of tropical fish are not stackable and difficult to carry, the best place to breed axolotls is a biome where tropical fish naturally spawn. Tropical fish spawn in warm ocean, lukewarm ocean, deep lukewarm ocean, mangrove swamp, and lush caves. The following example is in a warm ocean.

Once you have the materials you need, find a warm ocean and create a large holding pen for your axolotls. You can do this on land next to the warm ocean, or simply cordon off a section of the ocean, or carve an inlet into a beach. Build the pen so that the walls are at least one block higher than the water level, to prevent the axolotls from escaping. You can put a ladder in the pen to allow you to get in and out.

The breeding pen doesn't have to be deep. One layer of water is sufficient for axolotls to breed. A shallow breeding pen allows you to feed the axolotls without having to swim.

It is very important to build an additional layer of blocks on the sides of the breeding pen. Axolotls sometimes climb on land, in search of deeper water nearby, so if your breeding pen doesn't have a barrier, they are bound to escape to the ocean outside where the water is deeper. This also makes it hard for the player to get out of water, so you may put a ladder on the side of the breeding pen (like a real-life swimming pool), or use a trapdoor on the side that's normally in the "open" (vertical) position, and flip it to "close" (horizontal) when you need to get out.

Because axolotls are agile swimmers, it often happens that when you try to feed buckets of tropical fish to them, you miss and hit the bottom of the pool instead, releasing the fish which get instantly killed by axolotls. A solution to this problem is to build the entire floor of the breeding pen out of note blocks: when you accidentally hit on them, you tune the noteblock instead, and the fish don't get released from their buckets.

In Java Edition, drowned don't spawn in shallow water, although they can in Bedrock Edition. Either way, light up the border around the pen to prevent hostile mobs from spawning in it.
