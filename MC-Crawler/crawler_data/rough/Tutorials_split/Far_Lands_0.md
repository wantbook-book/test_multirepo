# Tutorials/Far Lands
The Far Lands are a dangerous place, both for players (due to lots of darkness, hostile mobs and falls) and the device Minecraft runs on. But, if you want to go to this place, here is how to reach it and lessen the lag.

## How to reach
In Java Edition, the Far Lands can only be found in versions from Infdev 2010/03/27 (though they existed in previous versions, the world became non-solid half-way to the far lands, which made it impossible to reach without teleporting) to Beta 1.7.3. They start generating near the coordinates of ±12,550,821 on X and Z axes. Given that one block’s side is one meter long, the distance to the Far Lands from the world’s center of coordinates can be measured as about 12,551 km (7844 mi). There is no conventional way of using Creative or commands to quickly reach this huge distance, since they didn't exist in these old versions, except for multiplayer. Instead, the different methods listed below are used. There is also a glitch in 1.12 where if you /tp <player name> 12550700 90 0, exit before you hit the ground, load the world in beta 1.7.3, you will be 124 blocks short of the far lands, this is a very easy way to reach it if you don't have the single player commands mod.

### Directly by the Overworld
Just walking in the Overworld towards any direction (positive or negative X and/or Z axis) is the most time-consuming way; reaching the Far Lands from the world center would take 9 months of overall Minecraft gameplay. However, it is safer than walking in the Nether and doesn't require items difficult to obtain. Crafting a bed before starting the long journey is recommended; sleeping in it before the night falls completely will avoid the annoyance of hostile mobs in the way. Crafting a handful of boats will also help crossing large water bodies. Pay attention to heights and avoid falling from them. Since hunger was not present prior to Beta 1.8, you won't need much food but only enough to restore your health in case of you losing it by falling or being hit but if you are on creative the fastest way to reach it is by flying and sprinting toward the same direction for Java Edition and with elytra and fireworks in Pocket Edition.

Time-wise, the walking (not sprinting) speed is 4.3 blocks per second. Walking for 6 hours per day is equal to 21,600 seconds, giving a travelled distance of 92,880 blocks every day. Walking to the 12.5M Far Lands would take just under 136 days at this pace.

Multiple players have reached the Far Lands legitimately through a terrestrial journey. The first Overworld-only journey was done by KilloCrazyMan. The most famous ongoing journey is KurtJMac[1]

### By the Nether
Walking one block in the Nether is equal to walking eight blocks in Overworld. Thus, by traveling through the Nether, it is possible to reach the Overworld Far Lands in just over a week. However, since the Nether is a rather dangerous dimension and many different items are required to construct a nether portal, it will take you a considerable time of trivial Minecraft play in order to obtain material and proper equipment. 

When finally in the Nether and adequately protected, the player must travel a few million blocks in the X and/or Z axis. It won't be so far as in the Overworld, but it will still be a long trip. Another portal will be required to exit the Nether, so, before proceeding, it is recommended to either mine all the obsidian blocks of the portal and take them with you, or bring enough blocks to construct an exit portal after your trip. Evidently, flint and steel should also be taken to easily light the portal. 

The Nether is a very dangerous place, so be very aware of mobs, lava, fire and high heights all around, and bring as much as food as you can to restore your health after the likely unfortunate events that will happen in your way. When the sufficient distance (see below) is finally reached, using the rebuilt portal will place the player near or in the Far Lands.

The nether portal in the Nether must be placed no further than at X/Z of ±4,000,000, because beyond that point, the portal would attempt to teleport the player to coordinates beyond X/Z of ±32,000,000, which is the limit on the world coordinates. Likewise, an Overworld portal even near X/Z of ±32,000,000, would lead the player to the coordinates near X/Z of ±4,000,000 (less than one-third of the way to the Far Lands), so it is not possible to reach the Nether Far Lands by this way. Placing the portal near X/Z of ±1,568,852 would allow the player to reach the inner edge of the Far Lands. If you reach X/Z ±12,550,820 in the Nether, the "Nether Far Lands" will generate. More info about the Nether Far Lands can be found here. 

If you tried to make a nether portal at the Nether Far Lands, you would end up at ±100,406,560 X/Z, which is impossible, because beyond 32,000,000 at the Overworld, blocks stop generating and "fake blocks" will generate. You can't edit the terrain beyond ±32,000,000 X/Z, so the nether portal can't appear past this point. This is a dangerous but faster method then walking from the Overworld.

The quickest way to get to the Far Lands is to using the elytra. Unless you plan to pack multiple elytras, bringing one with unbreaking 3 and mending is important, as depending on your starting location, you'll likely be flying over 1.5 million blocks. Frequently checking the durability of the elyctra is important to assure that no untimely deaths are met by way of fall damage. Night Vision potions will significantly lower your chances of flying into a wall, and Fire Resistance will save you from lava falls. Additionally, a totem of undying could be useful to save you in a tight spot. Fireworks can be used to propel your flight, and so taking a lot of these will make the trip much shorter; however, you will need to be extra vigilant, as flying faster will give you less time to react to sudden events and obstacles. Assuming a continuous rocket boost for the entire duration of the flight, and a completely straight flight path with no stops, it would take just over 13 hours to cover the distance (33.5 m/s over 1,568,852 meters). Needless to say, the journey is long.

Multiple players have reached the Far Lands through a terrestrial journey with a Nether shortcut. Furthermore, one person, Xelander, has reached the Nether Far Lands legitimately.[1]
