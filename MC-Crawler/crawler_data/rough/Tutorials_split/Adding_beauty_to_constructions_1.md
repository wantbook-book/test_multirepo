### Stairs
If you have staircases that use full blocks instead of stairs, it is a good idea to switch them out. It makes it much easier to walk. If you want long stairs, use slabs. For completely vertical transport use a minecart, piston, or water elevator. If you want to use up horizontal space, use slabs and blocks. You could also use a slab/stair/block recurring pattern for slightly longer stairs (1.5 blocks apart to be exact), for more horizontal travel. Also you can use slab/slab/block/block, slab/slab/stairs/block/block and so on to state the stairway's shininess.

### Hall
Make a hallway if you have multiple rooms. They should be three or four blocks wide for a large house, and two blocks wide for smaller ones. Use carpets for this part to add some color, though wool works as well. It is recommended to also leave a space for a window if you have the space, so it will look brighter.

### Exterior
Include a garden of shrubs, flowers, a few trees, and some potted plants. Put one or two leaf blocks on top of wood to make hedges. If your garden is large enough, consider adding a tree house, pool, or even a fountain (see far below) to be the center of attention. Make sure to put stairs and other tile blocks (like stairs and slabs) to make it look even better.

### Safety
When building a settlement or construction, you want a safe, useful, and reliable building. You don't want your finely decorated home, filled with diamond, plants, fountain, etc. to explode down to the ground or go down in flames. Here are a few safety precautions:

- Be careful withwoodandwool. They spreadfireand will be burnt. If you are building a house with it, and a fire starts, it won't burn forever, but you will lose a significant part of your house.

- Be careful when usingfire charges,flint and steel, orlava bucketsinside your house. One minute nothing's happening, then the next the whole house is alight.

- Lightning strikes can start fires, which will luckily be extinguished quickly by the rain. However, it would be much safer if you use alightning rod, especially if your house is built out of flammable blocks.

- Try not to build withdirt,grass block,sand, orred sand, becauseendermencan pick it up and letmobsinto your house.

### Others
Keep lots of open spaces and do not use too many doors, so your house will look more than "Designer". Light rooms up with redstone lamps or sea lanterns and glowstone instead of torches to improve lighting, or add chandeliers for a classier look. Also you can put paintings or item frames on the walls that look empty.

You can "hang up" a torch by placing a torch on a block, then an item frame on the same block, before finishing it up by placing a stone button, stone slab, or an anvil inside the item frame. Note that this will not work in Bedrock Edition due to the fact that item frames are not entities in that version. You can also keep cats and wolves in the building.

## Rooms
### Kitchen
Include tables. These can be made either by making an extended piston upwards, by placing a carpet/pressure plate on a fence/wall, or using upside-down stairs and slabs. The piston and slab methods allow you to place decorations on the table.

Don't forget a sink. It can be built using a filled cauldron or a hopper directed at the wall, with a down lever or tripwire hook at the top to simulate your taps. You could also place a dropper filled with water bottles behind the block bearing the lever (faucet), which when "turned on" will pour out free water.

For a cooking range you could use a smoker topped by iron pressure plates or detector rails, and put some stairs a few blocks above to simulate a range hood. 

Add a crafting table as a worktop, and droppers with item frames containing rotated snow layers as cabinets that hold bowls and bottles.

You could also add an island in the middle of the room, iron bars to simulate an area to hang pans, and a table that contains normal cake and chocolate cake simulated by daylight detectors.

Although expensive, hanging a beacon from the ceiling makes for elegant lighting.

### Living room
Include chairs and couches, and something decorative or something to do. You can also add a fireplace, but beware of fire! You can make fireplaces out of any material, but it is recommended to use stone or brick. You can also use a campfire to remove the risk, and add decorative appeal. Add a few chests and put some trapdoors on their faces, and you have a cabinet. You can also hide chests under chests here.

### 
Include a bed, paintings, a jukebox, and a dresser made by stacking chests behind doors.
Optionally, you may wish to include an ender chest to keep safe any valuables and easily transport materials in bulk. However, it may not be recommended due to the cost of the components used in construction. A bedside table is also great decoration (see "furniture" for table construction).

### Bathroom
Use dark prismarine for the floor, as it resembles small bathroom tiles. For bigger tiles, quartz does no harm. Glazed terracotta blocks can also help with tiling.

Add fences/ladders or end rods as a towel rack. Iron bars could also do good as a small radiator.

To build a toilet, put two upside down quartz stairs that are facing away from each other. On one side put a normal quartz block with a lever on top, and put an iron trapdoor on it so it lies on top of the other upside down stair.

### Furniture
Chair



Note that you can make a couch by adding more stairs. Chairs can also be made using a slab of preferably oak for the bottom, armrests made of trapdoors and a door for the back to give your chairs that extra-classy feel.

Table




A village-style table can be made from a pressure plate atop a fence post. Carpets can be used the same way, and look better. Connecting more than one table when using carpets will look better also. Oftentimes, a simple slab floating at waist-height can suffice, sometimes fitting in with 'alternative style homes'. Another way of making larger tables with only four legs is to use carpets, fence posts and string, as carpets can be placed on string.
