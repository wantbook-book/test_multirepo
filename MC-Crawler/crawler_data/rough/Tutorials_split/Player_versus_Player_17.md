### Mass battle
PvP in large factions can include multiple scenarios, from individual murders or attempts to murder, to entire factions battling it out with lines of defense, barricades, and tunnels.

** Open-field battle **
To make it brief, an open field battle is the combat of multiple factions in an open area. This can cause chaos and may lead to a slaughter in the right conditions. Be sure to be well-stocked for this.

First of all, the open field battle playstyle is to have minimal life lost on your side no matter what, even above the victory itself. 

Think about it like this. With lots of people on one side, as well as regeneration from a full hunger bar slowly healing each player (and health potions), the whole army in general is almost continuously regaining health. (If your army's hunger bar isn't full, you shouldn't be in a battle!) Since all the opponent's damage is not placed in a concentrated area, every person alive is in a sense helping heal others. When someone dies, their regeneration and health is lost. So is their ability to fight, and the formation they were in is weakened, so momentum in terms of a steady advance is lost. Therefore, minimal life loss is the goal throughout the battle.

There are three major melee builds, which will be discussed more in depth later. They are:

- The juggernaut. These are heavily enchanted soldiers. Highly costly to make!
- The infantry. These are normally armored soldiers without enchantments. They are cheap on everything but Iron.
- The exotic. These are users of exotic weapons (such as many potions or TNT, also including professional archers) with varying armor levels. They are not difficult but suicidal hard in certain cases. Not costly, but it takes time to make. Their purpose is to deploy an unusual weapon such as debuffs or explosions on their opponents.

It is tempting in an organized battle to do one of two things:

1. Charge the enemy.
2. Run from the main areas of combat to camp the areas nobody goes to.

Charging the enemy is a waste of time and durability due to damage distribution. It is also near-suicidal due to the large number of weapons present. Running wastes time as well and is both cowardly and counterproductive, as then damage distribution will be far less useful.

Instead, have all your soldiers in a group and have a continuously switching front line.

The first situation is if the enemy has large numbers of archers. Send a wave of soldiers charging in, with moderate armor, and some skill, as well as some Special units to cause some starting chaos in their lines. Even better, get some enderpearls and rush in to engage the archers, who will often be weaker in melee combat.

If they don't have archers, they will run or charge. If they run, have archers retreat to the back lines and then have the whole army sprint, bunching Juggernauts close to the front line while staying together, for maximum impact.

If they charge, stop their forward momentum with arrows, shooting when they are 10â€“15 meters away. Then the infantry should then fight for a bit, while juggernauts and potion lobbers move in at sprinting speed to surge into enemy lines and later replace the infantry and slaughter anyone that was engaging the infantry. Make sure that the juggernauts and potion lobbers do this carefully, as the enemy infantry may have lethal potions.

However, in general, the enemy can do little versus Juggernauts and potion lobbers coming in from a flank as well as a defensive row of Exotics to stop enemy Juggernauts from advancing effectively.

However, if you are on the attack, there are some threats to your advance you must take into account.

- A massed force of archers or snipers (These can really break a big section of the front line off. Terminate them as soon as possible.)
- A hardened, continually blocking front line (These are really hard to fight by, but you can bait them just by having a player sprint near them and run away.)

Then charge with infantry, followed immediately by exotics. The juggernauts among you should flank around and smash the enemy infantry after a few seconds of fighting. The Exotics should only engage juggernauts in combat, and only with superior numbers. In this situation, have archers aim for infantry advancing toward the fight, NOT the enemy front line, where you could shoot one of your own men. One can make some professional charging units with horses.

Never have everyone charge at once. They will lose momentum and a solid position, while also becoming less cohesive which causes less damage distribution. Retreat, while also dangerous, is far safer.

** PvP better **
Many people think Minecraft PvP is "just clicking with a sword", yet it is so much more than that. Learning how to PvP may seem simple, but takes days, weeks, even months to completely master PvP.

Getting killed? With this guide and some practice, you will be killing diamond people with iron! First off. Swords are everything. Kill your enemy, and they won't hurt you anymore. Unless you are a tank and have some kind of lucky-level-30-enchanted sword, always remember that swords will save your life any day.

- Leather armorThe weakest armor, full leather armor will shield you for up to 28% of damage taken. If anyone has full leather armor, the thing that they will likely be able to get(and because risk of death is high), is an iron sword because leather is just about as easy to farm as iron is to find. If you ambush them with an iron/stone sword, you should be able to get about 2 or 3 critical hits in most cases. Each critical hit should be able to do 7.

Please note that they will likely start running. The best thing to do is to cut corners, meaning if they're waiting to see a wall to turn, turn right when they turn, that way you will get to them because you're both at the same place and they have traveled the most. Jump while sprinting to get to your enemy if you have the hunger to spare.
- Gold armorMany people don't use this armor, and it shields for 44% of damage, if fully worn. A diamond sword critical hit will do 6hearts on it.
- Chain armorThis is the least used armor because it is so hard to get. Protecting for 48% of all damage, it is about as effective as gold armor.
- Iron armorThe third best armor and one of the most effective sets of armor (due to iron being easy to find) iron armor seems fairly weak to be the third-best armor. It protects for 60% of damage taken.

A stone sword will do 1 full heart of damage against it with no buffs. A critical hit with a diamond sword will do 8 of damage, and if that is Sharpness I then it will do 5 of damage.

- Diamond armorThe second strongest armor. It withstands a lot of punishment. Even a Sharpness V (5) sword will only do 3hearts of damage. It protects against 80% of damage taken. If fully enchanted with Protection IV (4) then a Sharpness V sword will only do 2hearts of damage.
- Netherite armorthis armor is crafted from a netherite ingot made from netherite scraps from ancient debris and gold. it has about 2600 durability, has 1 knockback resistance, 80% damage reduction and 3 armor toughness, it could take a real beating!

** How to snipe **
Sniping and using a bow can be difficult for some but for others it's their natural talent. Some people have many styles of shooting such as jumping and shooting, aiming upward and strafing to the right/left or by simply hammering people with spam shots.

This tactic by itself is very ineffective if not combined with melee combat, as shields and healing easily defeat the lower damage of bows. However, as a method to drain your opponent of resources, sniping them can whittle them down over time and make a difference.

** Some basics **
In order to do this, you need:

- as many arrows as you think you need unless you have Infinity on your bow
- armor, unless suicide mission or if using invisibility
- food (doesn't have to have high saturation foods since you should be far away from getting hit)

Also, it is recommended that you strafe from left to right when shooting and you should also know when the right time it is to shoot another person. A good scenario is that your in battle with another person, and they're a good few blocks away cocking their bow up and you just started charging your own, what do you do? Well, first of all, you release it halfway there then strafe so that when they shoot, you have the advantage of shooting back at them dealing more damage to the enemy. To hit moving enemies, lead the arrow ahead of them some blocks depending on their distance.

** Sniping **
Sniping is attempting to hit targets at long range with a bow. Done well, sniping can deplete an enemy's health or knock them off a cliff before they even notice you, or at least before they're upon you.

When using a bow at short range, there is no need to aim significantly up.

At 1 degree upward, a bow will hit anyone within 25 meters with over a 90% probability of hit.

At further ranges, the level of precision needed to have a good hit rate increases. It is still possible to achieve hit rates close to 90% out to 60 meters, with a pitch of around 10 degrees. However, it is necessary to accurately estimate the range of the target. For example, an 8-degree pitch shot will hit a target between about 47 and 52 meters out with 90% accuracy, or about 46 to 54 with 50% accuracy. This means that judging distance accurately should be a reflexive habit for anyone who wants to learn sniping archery. Being able to, in a split second, figure out the range of a target, the height, and the approximate angle needed to hit (hint: F3 menu helps) will allow you to make shots at truly vast distances, with a 37-degree angle putting shots to around 120 meters.

If you want a mathematical formula as a guideline that will work fairly well under 80 meters.

Aim 1 degree up for every 4 blocks away your target is over 18 on level ground, compensating for movement appropriately. So for example, to hit a target 50 meters away, aim up by 8 degrees. 62 meters away, aim up by 11 degrees. 74 meters away, 14 degrees.

So Pitch = (distance - 18)/4.

Another good thing to do is keep in mind the target's horizontal angle. This allows you to make shots confident that the target is horizontally at the right position. Further, learning to judge distance is valuable. As a rule of thumb, a block at 60 meters away is 1 degree tall. A player at 60 meters away is about 1.8 degrees tall.

So for ex, let's say you see a player you want dead and they're at your altitude: the procedure a good sniper will go through is as follows.

1. Check the distance to the player by measuring their height in degrees. 1.4 degrees tall means 77 meters away.
2. If they're stationary, check the horizontal heading and note it.
3. Pull up by the appropriate amount. So in our example, it's 59/4=14.75 degrees. 14.7 for simplicity.
4. Make final lead adjustments based on player movement.
5. Fire. Don't just fire once unless you know you'll hit AND kill. Best to fire off shot after shot unless absolute stealth is a priority. This serves two purposes. For one thing, a bow can't hit with 100% reliability at 77 meters (My tests vs. armor stands indicate 60% accuracy, vs. 80% at 60 meters), no matter how good your aim, and unless you have a powerful bow vs. an injured or lightly armored foe or one above a hazard like a cliff or lava, it is likely your first hit will not be instantly lethal. If the enemy is walking toward or away from you, compensate by 1 degree per second. If the enemy is sprinting, up it to 1.3 degrees per second. If they are sprint-jumping, by 1.6 degrees per second, and also an additional amount due to them being higher up on average.

If a player is higher than you, a simple way of compensating is to look them in the face and set that as your zero. This works for relatively flat shots that aren't at an enormous range. For example, let's say we look at a player 9 degrees above us who's 1.8 degrees tall? They appear to be 60 meters away based on their height. 60-18=42. 42/4=10.5. 19.5 degrees pitch is a good approximation of where to aim. I wouldn't try this method for targets more than about 30 degrees off of level, and not for long range shots, but for under 70 meters and 30 degrees, it works quite reasonably.

Obviously, you don't need to do a bunch of math every time you fire a bow, but these rules of thumb can help you aim at a long range.

** Shooting styles **
Many people who shoot have developed their own style of shooting such as:

** Strafing **
People who strafe just simply move in one direction while shooting the target and occasionally take cover when getting pinned down. So when shooting you have to aim slightly above your target's head before shooting for a larger hit rate. In extended combat, opponents may be able to read your strafing patterns if you move predictably, so be sure to vary your strafing.

** Classic sniping **
While most of your allies are fighting the enemy melee (better if there aren't many troops on each side), the classic styled sniper (which have powerful bows) can fire a precise shot which will do good damage while the enemy cannot retaliate much due to your allies attacking them with a sword. Be sure not to hit the ally though. One may drink invisibility potions so even if the enemy noticed the shot and want to hit the sniper first, they cannot shoot the sniper.


Note that arrows can also activate wooden buttons or pressure plates, thus making good archers able to operate redstone contraptions from afar.
