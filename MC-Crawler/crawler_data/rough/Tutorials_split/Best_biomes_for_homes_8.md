#### Tips
- Like the desert, come back here after venturing to the mainland so you can have wood to start your gameplay with.
- You can get dirt blocks to build a bridge to the mainland.
- If you find one of these biomes when in a boat, use the extra space to take a mooshroom with you back to your base. It is also a good idea to note down its coordinates.
- Make sure to sleep regularly in this biome, because if you forget to sleep for 3 days you are attacked by a group of phantoms when leaving this biome (even if you just leave for one block).

### Beach
When it comes to how to live on a beach, it really comes down to how to survive in their adjacent biomes. Beaches themselves are biomes of barren sand/gravel except for sugar cane, turtle nests, and buried treasure, if you manage to stumble on some when terraforming. Beaches are mainly appealing for players who want to be able to see the ocean or have an above water base for ocean operations.

#### Pros
- As mentioned above, beaches are good for players who want to see the ocean, but live on land, or have an above-ground base when not exploring the ocean.
- If you live near a turtle nest, turtles lay eggs, which hatch into babies that drop scute, who grow into an adult and repeat the process. Turtles remember their nest location meaning that the same area is permanently the center of their activity. The player may need to set up protection for them, as undead mobs attempt to crush turtle eggs or kill the baby turtles.
- You could stumble upon a buried treasure chest without a map, but it is unlikely. Additionally, a beach dweller would find little use for a conduit.
- Sugar cane grows adjacent to water, so a beach makes a great natural farm.
- A good amount of sand, or gravel if you live next to a cold biome.
- Sometimes, shipwreck generate on beaches.

#### Cons
- Hostile mobs are generally no worse here than any other flat, barren biome, but a turtle nest may attract unwanted attention.
- Other cons mainly consist of the cons of your neighboring biomes.

#### Useful resources
Turtle eggs, scutes, heart of the sea, sugar cane, sand, gravel and shipwrecks are useful resources found here.

### Jungle
Although the jungle may not be the best place to start for new players, it can provide lots of wood, as giant jungle trees are the biggest trees in the game. Also, if the traps are avoided, the jungle pyramid has some loot worth taking. One of the problems with the jungle is that thick bundles of leaves generate on the ground, making it hard to navigate. The trees in a jungle can also have horizontal branches on which mobs can spawn.

#### Pros
- Massive amounts of wood.
- Jungle templeshave loot and redstone in them and can also serve as houses. Be careful of thedispensersthat shoot arrows.
- Ocelotsspawn naturally. They scare away creepers, which may be hard to notice due to their green texture against the green leaves.
- Grass blocks here are vibrant green.
- Melonsandcocoa beansgenerate here.
- The large jungle trees can be made into treehouses, which are easy to protect. This makes it a great biome for multiplayer bases.
- Parrotsspawn naturally. They mimic the noises of nearby mobs, making them useful for detecting hostile mobs.
- Bamboonaturally generates here, great for crafting scaffolding and sticks.
- Pandascan be found here.
- Zombie villagers spawn here wearing unique clothes which can be cured into jungle villagers.

#### Cons
- Limited space for building on the ground due to the thick tree foliage.
- Falling out of a tree is easy and can be fatal.
- The thick vegetation makes it difficult to navigate.
- Hostile mobs, especially creepers, can be camouflaged in the green scenery.
- Can generate more lag than other biomes.
- Cannot obtain pufferfish or tropical fish when fishing.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

#### Useful resources
Jungle wood, vines, melons, loot from jungle pyramids, cocoa beans, parrots, ocelots, bamboo, pandas‌[Bedrock Edition  only] are useful resources found in jungles.

#### Tips
- This biome is the only place where jungle wood can be found naturally, so have a resource base here.
- Build and travel as much as possible on top of trees for clearer vision and easier navigation.

#### Multiplayer
Jungles are an interesting biome to live in. First off, the chances of enemies finding a base is minuscule, particularly if it is concealed. Second, a lot of wood can be harvested, and melons provide a source of food (albeit an inefficient one) as well as being tradable with farmer villagers. Jungle pyramids can be used as ready-made bases. However, there are several downsides. It is difficult to construct defenses, and you may have to clear out a large area if building on the ground, which consumes much time. As well as this, jungles are often large and hard to navigate, so you might need to write down the coordinates of your base. Treebases can be accessed by vines, and can be hidden easily.

### Bamboo jungle
Bamboo jungles share many similarities with regular jungles, though instead of jungle trees, massive amounts of dense bamboo shoots and only giant jungle trees can be found.

#### Pros
- Loads of bamboo.
- Jungle pyramidshave loot in them (they can serve as houses, too). Just be careful of thedispensersthat shoot arrows.
- Ocelotsspawn naturally. This scares away creepers, which may be hard to notice due to their green texture and dense amount of foliage.
- Lush beautiful grass.
- Pandas spawn here, which is more common than in regular jungles.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
	- InJava Edition, the bamboo jungle is the only place where pandas can be found.
- The large jungle trees can be made into treehouses, which are easy to protect.
- One of the biomes where podzol can be found.
- Parrotsspawn naturally and can imitate the sound of nearby mobs, useful for detecting hostile mobs.
- Zombie villagers spawn here wearing unique clothes which can be cured into jungle villagers.
- Melon patches can be found, though not as abundant in the regular jungle.
