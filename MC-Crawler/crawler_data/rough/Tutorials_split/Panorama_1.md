This panorama had been taken on the seed 6006096527635909600 at coordinates X=482.208, Y=78.515, Z=-1127.193 in the Nether. This seed spawns the player in a plains biome in 240, 168 in The Overworld and in a basalt deltas biome in 30, 21 in The Nether. Distance direction is 9868 blocks SSW in lukewarm ocean biome in the Overworld and 1234 blocks SSW in soul sand valley biome in the Nether. This seed generates mostly correct in version 20w13a.[7]

In Java Edition, this panorama was introduced in 20w14a, currently used in 20w06a to 1.16.5 (includes Combat Test 6 to Combat Test 8c), and once used in 20w45a to 21w14a.

In Bedrock Edition, this panorama is used for versions from beta 1.16.0.57 to beta 1.17.0.52.

This panorama used in Java and Bedrock editions are the same. When this panorama was first introduced in Bedrock Edition, it had used the version without torches.

The seed for this panorama is unknown. It was originally introduced in snapshot 21w15a, then changed in snapshot 21w18a to remove torches.[8]

In Java Edition, this panorama was introduced in 21w15a, currently used in 20w45a to 1.17.1 (includes 1.18 Experimental Snapshot 1 to 1.18 experimental snapshot 7), and once used in 21w37a to 21w40a.

In Bedrock Edition, this panorama is used for versions from beta 1.17.0.54 to beta 1.18.0.20.

### 
| Java Edition / Bedrock Edition |
|--------------------------------|
|                                |

This panorama used in Java and Bedrock editions are same.

This panorama had been taken on the seed 2151901553968352745 at coordinates X=4.83 Y=130.15 Z=-7294.28. This seed spawns the player in a windswept hills biome at 0, 0. Distance direction is 7294 blocks S in snowy taiga biome. This seed generates mostly correct on snapshot 21w40a.[9] Interestingly, this seed is exactly the same seed as the one used in the original panorama that was present in the game from Beta 1.8 until the Update Aquatic. This was an easter egg put in the game by Jappa, thought to be inspired by a tweet.[10] He later confirmed that this was indeed an homage that put emphasis on how much Minecraft had changed over the years.[11]

In Java Edition, this panorama was introduced in 21w41a, currently used in 21w37a to 1.18.2 (includes Deep Dark Experimental Snapshot 1 and 22w13oneBlockAtATime), and once used in 22w11a to 22w14a.

### Bedrock Edition Preview

|                 |

This panorama is exclusively available on Bedrock Edition Previews after Preview 1.18.20.22. And, it is the only panorama the player could see in Previews.

Ironically, despite this panorama being exclusive to Bedrock Edition, it had actually been taken in a Java Edition version before 1.18 Pre-release 5, which can be inferred from the color of water and the side texture of the dirt path.
