## Building
From starting to mid-game, your only building material is dirt. After you grow and harvest some woods, your priorities are:

- A woodenhoefor makingfarmland.
- Woodenswordsfor killing mobs more efficiently
- Abedfor sleeping during some nights without rain to preventphantomsfrom spawning (Raining make farmland hydrated which help your crops grow.)
- Woodenshovelsfor mining dirt and making dirt paths (which prevent slimes from spawning.)
- Fencesand a fewfence gatesfor animal farms, but you can use a hole in the ground.
- Trapdoorsto make mob traps and grinders.

Wooden tools are the best you can expect to have for a long time. When you are able to get a toolsmith villager much later in the game, you can trade for stone, iron, and diamond tools.

Creepers and slimes are everywhere during the day and night. You cannot prevent them from spawning, but you can use wooden shovels to turn the area around your home base to dirt path blocks and build a fence around it to prevent them from spawning or entering your area. Until this is done, you are likely to get many craters in the ground from creeper explosions.

Creepers have an annoying tendency to destroy your home base, so don't do anything too fancy until you have a protected area to build in. A simple shelter with a crafting table and a chest are sufficient to start with. Once you have fenced in and spawn-proofed an area of reasonable size, you can make a better shelter and a bed.

Slimes are annoying. If you have a way to identify slime chunks, then you can spend some time and resources converting these to dirt paths to prevent slimes from spawning near your base, as well as positioning your base away from slime chunks. Otherwise, you can fence in your area and convert the surface to dirt paths.

## Feeding yourself
Cooking your food is not an option for the first 100+ in-game days. To cook food, you need to succeed in the most difficult task: starting a village. Then you can trade with a fisherman villager for a campfire. A furnace isn't possible because stone is unavailable without cheats.

Livestock animals are abundant in a flat world and replenish themselves as you kill them for food. Chickens, cows, pigs, and sheep can all be eaten raw, and drop other useful things like leather for armoring yourself and wool for making a bed. At the start of your world, you should kill all passive mobs in spawn chunks to make more mobs spawn elsewhere.

In addition, you can farm crops from seeds and roots (carrots or potatoes) found in your bonus chest. Grow enough of these to breed animals as appropriate. Chickens like seeds harvested from wheat, cows and sheep like wheat, and pigs like carrots, potatoes, or beetroots.

Killing skeletons gives you bones, which you can craft into bone meal. Applying bone meal to the grass blocks all around you causes flowers and grass to grow. Breaking the grass can give you seeds which you can use to grow wheat and breed animals.

Zombies have a small chance to drop a carrot or potato, which can be used to breed pigs. Pigs are necessary in the long journey to getting a villager.

You need a hoe to convert grass or dirt blocks into farmland. Plant your crops, although growth is slow until the farmland is hydrated, and for that you must wait for rain.

## Survival goals
There are several points at which you may decide you've had enough of this flat survival.

The first respectable goal is simply get to the point where you can feed yourself indefinitely, defend yourself, and survive. This is a hand-to-mouth existence. Once you accomplish this, you are well prepared for island survival or more challenging desert survival games.

A good second goal is to create an infinite water source, from which you can feed yourself with fish, create larger bodies of water for fishing up enchanted loot, and creating drowned farms. This goal itself involves a lot of hard work, including a "mega-project" of making a mob farm without water (see below).

An extremely challenging goal is to create a village. Doing this requires accomplishing a difficult and lengthy chain of dependent tasks described in the following sections, as well as luck.

## Waterless mob farm
There are two basic techniques to farm mobs without using water. But remember that zombies need to be killed by player to drop iron[1].

The simplest is a dig in the ground, 2 blocks deep, generally surrounding your home base. The moat is lined with open trapdoors, which hostile mobs view as solid blocks even when they are open. When they pathfind to you, they fall into the moat, then you can kill them with your sword or fist.

[OLD NEEDS TESTING] A more labor-intensive way, but with greater yield after the initial effort, is to make an aerial farm. Mobs drop down from a spawning platform, taking enough fall damage that they can be killed in one punch. You don't want them to die by falling, because zombies drop iron ingots only if killed by the player.

- If you're in Bedrock Edition, make sure yoursimulation distanceis set to 4 (minimum). This causes mobs to despawn when they are more than 44 blocks away from you.
- Build a pillar with ladders 21 blocks high. Or build a staircase out of blocks (such as slabs) that mobs cannot spawn on. 21 blocks of falling distance is required to inflict maximum fall damage on mobs without killing them.
- At 20 blocks of height, build a platform using dirt and open trapdoors. You can use any pattern of dirt and trapdoors in approximately equal proportions. As long as you avoid creating 3×3 areas in your platform, you prevent spiders from spawning (and by this time you have likely killed enough spiders for all the string you could ever need). It doesn't have to be a large platform; 10×10 or 16×16 or any reasonable size. The bigger the platform, the larger chance it has to spawn mobs.
- Fence off the area below the platform into which mobs fall from above. Leave a gap in the corner.
- Use a shovel to convert the surrounding land todirt pathblocks. At simulation distance 4, you need to clear at least 44 blocks from all around the fenced-off area, so that mobs can spawn only on the platform. Preferably clear more blocks because the mob spawning radius is centered on you, and you cannot always be at the center of the farm. This forces all mobs to spawn on the platform.

This farm works only at night unless you spend extra time building a large roof over the platform, overhanging the edge by 7 blocks, and made from blocks that mobs cannot spawn on (such as wooden stairs, slabs, or dirt path blocks). The advantage to night-time-only operation is that you can focus your day on survival activities: feeding yourself, breeding livestock, harvesting wood to make more tools, and so on. 

Stand a small distance from the landing area (so that you are 24 blocks from the platform, which is the minimum spawn radius) and wait for mobs to fall, then run into the landing area to kill them with one punch each. If the mob is wearing armor, or if it's a witch, you may need your wooden sword because these mobs still have multiple health points after falling.[needs testing]
