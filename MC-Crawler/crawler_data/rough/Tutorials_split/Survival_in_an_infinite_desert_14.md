### Modifying Bedrock level.dat world file
By modifying the level.dat file, you can get an infinite desert. You have to:

1. Make a new world
2. Close the world after making the world
3. Open any NBT Editors (Universal Minecraft Editor, MCC Tool Chest, Blocktopograph)
4. Open the world NBT
5. Find the "BiomeOverride" tag and type "desert" (in default, BiomeOverride tag is empty)
6. Save the changes
7. Delete the "db" folder in the world
8. You got an infinite desert!

If you don't know the worlds directory:

## Raiding techniques for desert temples
A picture of an open chest inside of a desert temple, showing some of the loot available once a desert temple has been found.
If you have a pickaxe, just dig down two blocks away from the blue terracotta on the floor in any direction. If not,

- Go outside and dig up 16 blocks of sand.
- Dig out a piece of orange terracotta on the floor.Do not jump in!
- Place blocks of sand into the hole until it is filled up.
- Dig straight down until you are two blocks away from the floor.
- If there aremobs, kill them.
- Punch out thepressure platein the middle of the floor.
- Take anything you need out of thechests. Bones are good for bone meal, and anyiron,gold,diamonds, oremeraldsare also definite needs. Also, remember to dig out the 3×3 layer ofTNTunderneath the sandstone floor.
- Using the pillar-jump technique, pillar-jump your way out.

## Summary
- Finddirtor craftsandstoneor find a small cave for shelter on your first day, otherwise you can die on your first night because you can't make a roof.
- Don't fight anything, if you can help it. You're too weak. Use defensive structures and only ever fight with a strong defensive advantage.
- If structures are allowed, find avillageas soon as possible and use/steal thecrafting tableandfurnace. Requisition some of thetorches. Loot the chests. Ingots or diamonds for making tools are a top priority. Loot the crops too, but always replant what you take.
- Get out of villages—especially large villages—before dusk so you don't trigger mob attacks on them. Guard the villagers carefully so you cantradewith them. Stay out of the village at night until you have made the villagers totally safe.
- The most likely way to "Advance to the Stone Age" is either to find aniron pickaxein a smith's chest; or to get a village crafting table, and then craft one from ingots from village chests or dropped by mobs; or trick acreeperinto "mining" somecobblestonefor you and craft astone pickaxe.
- However you get one, getting a pickaxe is a critical breakthrough. Make a pickaxe out of diamond or gold if necessary, to collect your first cobblestone and enter the Stone Age.
- Save yoursticks(from dead bushes) for makingtoolsandweapons. They're too rare and valuable to use as fuel unless there are no villages to provide furniture to burn.
- Save your furnace fuel for smeltingore, not cooking food. Eat raw food. It's, er, good for you.
- Save your firstironfor making abucket. Use stone tools, not iron tools, because stone doesn't use fuel, and you are incredibly short of fuel.
- Once you have a bucket, uselavafor fuel and go crazy with the furnace. Smelting! Cooked food! Yes, the Bucket Age is the high-point of Desert Biome civilization.

If you can't find a village,

- You may be able to find dirt/grass,water,flowers,rabbits, maybe evenseeds. If only you had any tools (ahoeor apickaxeeven)!
- You can try to get planks or logs from a Pillager Outpost or Mineshaft, but be prepared to fight. The absolute priority is 4 planks to make a crafting table. A bonus is 3 more for awooden pickaxe.
- If you find a livingtree(in the river biomes of Buffet customized desert worlds only, and rare) orsaplingsin a village, it's "desert challenge over" and you can now transition to a normal, wood-based game of Minecraft.
- However, on Superflat worlds with nostructures, you are stuck as a pre-stone-age hunter-gatherer forever. You eat dead people, and your only tools or weapons are scavenged from dead people who never drop what you really need: four lousyplanks, or failing that, apickaxeand ahoe—the legendary tools of the gods. So, there is no way to ever progress beyond that. Just a grim evolutionary dead end.
