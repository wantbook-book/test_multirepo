# Tutorials/Elevators
This page lists ideas for elevators. An elevator, or lift, in Minecraft is a vertical transport system for carrying players, mobs, and items between the floors of a structure. Some simpler designs require the player to walk or swim, while in other more complex designs, the player can be transported hundreds of blocks higher with just the click of a button or the flick of a lever.

This page deals with contraptions; however, it is worth noting that recent game versions offer considerable competition from basic blocks and plants:  Ladders can be placed along the side of a column; regular, crimson, or twisted vines can be seeded on the side, bottom, or top of a block and grow from there.  Underwater or underground, bubble columns provide an even faster option.  (They do require a column of source blocks, but planting  kelp can turn falling water into water sources easily.)  A simple fall can be cushioned by water, slime blocks, or a brush with honey blocks.

## Piston elevator
There are many designs of piston elevators. They all essentially use pistons to move the players either up or down.

### TNT cannon
Main article: Tutorials/TNT cannons
This extremely fast elevator uses gravity and water to compress primed TNT into a small area, creating a powerful explosion force. It is hard to use effectively in that TNT is expensive and hard to produce in large quantities, and is dangerous in Survival. 




### Multi-floor elevator
These elevators can ascend and descend and can stop and start at desired floors, but can be complicated and require more resources. These elevators often use characteristics of other designs and apply multi-floor circuitry to make them. They can be practical but can take a very long while to make, and not that useful. Have patience when creating this strenuous build.




### Up - Down Elevator
The up and down elevator has a maximum height of 12 units due to the limited amount of blocks a piston can move. This design is also relatively slow, but thanks to its small form factor and simple redstone circuits this can be suited for buildings.

Up and Down




This elevator provides an unlimited blocks piston-elevator but is a bit more complicated.

Up and Down


### Fast
Fast piston elevators are quicker than more traditional ways of gaining height, like ladders and powered minecarts. They are designed to be practical.

#### Zipper
Zipper elevators feature pairs of pistons stacked vertically. The stair version can be open on two opposite sides and is useful for giving views above ground. The no-stair version can be open only on one side. They have one major drawback, as multiplayer can cause a malfunction in the timing and cause the elevator to cease function. Also, adding a 1Ã—2 piston on the top to push you onto a platform once you have reached the top to prevent the player from falling back down can be beneficial. 

Zipper Elevator


#### Spiral
Spiral elevators feature a vertically stacked spiral of pistons. Since the pistons and wiring surround the player while they ascend, this type is not good for giving a clear view. However, they are more suitable for multiplayer, as they do not transport the player as quickly and so are less likely to trap the player due to lag. 

Spiral Elevator


### Moderate
These elevators operate at a moderate and practical speed. They are designed to provide a more realistic appearance and operation than most other elevators.

#### Piston-worm
Piston-worm designs use a set of alternating pistons to push the player or a carriage up and down a shaft. Often these designs are very resource-friendly and simple to build.

Flying machine designs are fast, efficient and resemble a real-life elevator. They use a two-way vertical flying machine to carry the player up or down. They are special due to their capability to carry many players and mobs at once and their safety.
