#### Magma cubes

See also: Magma Cube

Magma cubes are common in the Nether, especially in basalt deltas biome. They behave similarly to slimes. Two smaller kinds of magma cubes are both easily killed with a stone sword (or better), even in large numbers, as they have low health and a slow attack rate, but big magma cubes can be deadly. Due to their jumping attack, they are very hard to hit and dodge, and while they have less health than the player at 16 × 8, their natural armor negates some of the received damage, making their practical health much higher.

In Java Edition, killing a large magma cube in one melee hit is possible only with Strength effect and critical hits. Some ways to achieve the one-hit kill include:

- Strength I + netherite axe + Sharpness V + critical hit;
- Strength II + diamond sword + Sharpness V + critical hit;
- Strength II + stone axe + critical hit.

When fighting one magma cube in a flat area, time your attack: wait until the cube jumps and just after it lands, hit it. Time between cube's jumps is long enough to land a hit, and it won't jump again while taking damage, so you can continue attacking. Once the big cube is defeated, fighting its smaller counterparts should be much easier. A sword with Sweeping Edge enchantment‌[Java Edition  only] helps in slaying resulting smaller magma cubes.

An easier way to deal with a group of magma cubes is to shoot an arrow at one of them from a safe place out of the magma cubes range, so they can't see you. Once you have shot the magma cube it either comes after you or just ignores you, depending on how far away you are. Repeat this process until there is no more giant magma cubes, then you can rush in and kill the smaller ones, or, if you don't want the drops, you can shoot them as well. In Java Edition, a crossbow with firework rockets can be used to clear a group of small and/or medium magma cubes from a safe range, as long as gunpowder is in plentiful supply.

#### Blazes

See also: Blaze

Blazes appear only in nether fortresses. They use a ranged projectile, which deals fire damage, and a melee attack. Additionally, blazes can fly: they move up or down to gain a height advantage or hide behind cover between fireball volleys. Their horizontal movement is extremely slow, and they are unable to pursue a player or maneuver effectively in close combat. In open areas they can rise out of reach of melee attacks if the player gives them enough time, but at melee range a blaze on the ground can often be hit two or three times with a sword before they are out of reach. Blazes can be killed in one melee hit in the same ways as creepers.

Potions of Fire Resistance are very helpful in fighting blazes, as this effect completely nullifies their projectile attack, but not the melee attack, which is not considered fire damage. Getting some of these potions from bartering with piglins before coming to a fortress is recommended. A shield is useful as well, as it can block upcoming projectiles.

Blazes fire a volley of three fireballs that lasts 0.9 seconds, followed by a very long recharge delay of 5 seconds, while it only takes 1 second to fully charge a bow, making a player's skill at timing their attacks and shield blocking/taking cover the key to blaze combat. Their range of 48 blocks is comparable to bow's 52 blocks, but the fireball's flat trajectory can create an effective range advantage in the nether where overhanging terrain is common, and even more so in enclosed fortress corridors. Silent, surprise fireball attacks by distant blazes are a risk while walking on open-air fortress bridges and the general vicinity of a fortress. If you can see a blaze, it can probably see you (and hit you) as well.

As with any mob, a group of blazes can be especially challenging. They each attack at the first opportunity, resulting in a devastating mass volley of fireballs. Fortunately, they do not use coordinated volley fire that could pin you down, but rather leave their entire group helpless for up to 5 seconds while they recharge after firing en masse, giving you the opportunity to advance, retreat, place or mine blocks, or repeatedly attack, before having to take cover or shield block again.

Blazes can only spawn in light level 11 or lower (at the lower half of their body). Much like ghasts, the blaze's ability to fly can make it difficult to recover their loot after killing them, though usually the greater concern is the many fires a group of blazes can ignite around themselves, potentially destroying drops before the player can pick them up.

Blaze spawners generate in fortresses and start spawning blazes once you get within 16 blocks of it. The spawner has a chance of spawning 1–4 blazes at once. 'Camping' at a blaze spawner is an effective way to gather blaze rods, as they almost always appear close enough to attack with a sword. This is best done in combination with the Fire Resistance potion. There is a delay in blaze's attack after it spawns, because it has to charge first. You can also build a doorway, 2 blocks tall and 1 block wide, where you can camp and kill the blazes as they come down. This strategy is extremely effective if you cover up the roof of the spawner room, but remember about blaze's melee attack that damages you if they get too close.

A blaze suffers damage from snowballs, and would be damaged by water if there was any in the Nether. Alas, snow golems do not survive in the Nether unless immediately provided with a potion of Fire Resistance. However, player-thrown snowballs are still a viable tactic. Due to their ease of acquisition and infinite supply, snowballs can be considered superior to archery for battling blazes. Though they can't be used to damage other kinds of mobs, carrying a few stacks of snowballs while exploring nether fortresses is an good way of repelling unexpected waves of spawned blazes. In addition, other mobs like wither skeletons and magma cubes can often be knocked off the high fortress bridges with snowballs, adding further usefulness.
