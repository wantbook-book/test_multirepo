7:00–9:00

Build a basic shelter (worry about the size and looks later, focus on functionality). For now, build it with dirt and/or planks. If you have spawned in a desert biome (and collected sand during Minute One) sand walls and sandstone roof. 


If you are in tundra and have a shovel, you can build with snow blocks.

After shelter, food, and a bed, your highest priority on day 1 is a source of light. With light, you can work usefully during your first night. Without it, it is possible but if you leave, mobs could spawn and it is hard to see what you are doing in the dark. 

If you found and mined coal, craft some torches to light up the shelter.

If you did not find coal, build a furnace and make some charcoal from wood logs. This is a higher priority than food, as you shouldn't get too hungry until later in the game. However, you should avoid excess sprinting and jumping.

Place the crafting table and make a furnace.


Make your first charcoal (if needed) by smelting a log in a furnace.

Use this charcoal to cook up to 8 more logs. You can keep using this method to get charcoal until you find coal ore. The charcoal is used to make torches in the absence of coal (see the earlier torch recipe.) Make at least one batch of torches to keep your shelter lit at night, so you can work through the night. Make more batches if you plan on mining.

Make some torches as per the preceding section. Once you have a source of light, you can stop worrying about the impending darkness and do other tasks all night long. 

Earlier, you hopefully collected some meat by killing animals – "...at least three pieces of meat, exactly six is best." Now, it's time to cook it in a furnace with some planks:

If you spotted coal earlier, go and mine it while waiting for the meat to cook.

A furnace batch always takes ten seconds to complete. Coal and charcoal last 80 seconds, and so do 8 batches. Planks last 15 seconds, so two can do three batches. This is consistent for all furnace recipes, even ones late in the game.

See Smelting for the details.

If you have additional wood, make a wooden door. Zombies have the ability to break doors on hard mode, but if you are a beginner, you shouldn't be playing on hard mode anyway. Please keep this in mind when building your entrance/exit to your shelter. Place the door outside and place it on the outer side of the block of your entrance to the shelter.

If you are out of wood, just place a couple of cheap blocks in the doorway until morning. You can make a door tomorrow.

### Minute Nine
9:00–10:00

Get ready for the night and craft a bed if you gathered wool. You need three wool blocks of the same color.


While you have this extra time, it would be a good idea to craft a chest to store unwanted and unnecessary items to carry around at all times such as seeds, eggs, leather, or extra food.


### Minute Ten
10:00
Go to bed. If you have not gathered enough wool for a bed to sleep in, or do not want to use one, first check to see if your base is secure (has all four walls, has a roof, a door or at least a blocked doorway, and ideally is lit). It is not recommended to add decorations to your house on the first day.

If you don't have enough wool (or wood) for a bed to sleep on, then, as long as you have a light source, you can use the night time more usefully by crafting or by starting to make a mine. From mines you can get lots of useful items such as iron, coal, redstone, gold, lapis lazuli, diamond, and emerald. Never dig straight down, as it is very dangerous. you could fall into a mob-filled cave, into lava, or fall into a large ravine. Mines are also a good way to find caves.

If you don't have enough coal or charcoal to make many torches for the mine, you can organize your items and house to make finding and moving easier, and do crafting (crafting is possible, though difficult, even in complete darkness). Also, if you managed to gather some leather (at least 4 pieces) by killing cows or rabbits, you might craft some leather armor. It's weak but better than nothing.
