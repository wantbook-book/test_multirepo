## Neutral mobs
Neutral mobs do not attack the player unless provoked. For different mobs, this "provokation" can mean different things: usually, if you hit a neutral mob, it fights back. Some neutral mobs also exhibit "pack behavior": if you hit one mob, all nearby mobs of this type attack you at once.

### Overworld mobs
#### Wolves

See also: Wolf

If player hits a stray wolf, this and any other stray wolves nearby become hostile (pack behavior). They remain hostile until the player escapes or they die, similar to zombified piglins. Killing a single wolf isn't difficult, as they have only 8 health (a single hit from a stone axe), but a large enough pack can be dangerous if player is unarmored.

Trying to hide in tight spaces is not a good idea, as a wolf can easily fit in a 1x1 hole. An effective combat method against a pack of wolves is building a two-block pillar and slowly dispatching the wolves with a sword. A lava bucket can also be useful.

#### Spiders

See also: Spider

Spiders are 1 block high, and as such, they are able to sneak under some obstacles. However, spiders are also 2 blocks wide, so a 1×1 hole doesn't let them pass. Spiders can also climb any solid blocks, and simple walls of any height don't stop them.

In the daytime (or in presence of artificial light sources, like torches), spiders become neutral. They only attack you if you attack them, but if they were hostile toward you during the night, they stay hostile. Spiders don't pose much danger: they don't exhibit pack behavior and deal low damage, only 2 to 3. A spider has 16 × 8 health and can be killed in one melee hit in the same ways as a piglin, but is also considered an arthropod, thus the enchantment Bane of Arthropods deals higher damage to spiders; although the enchantment is rarely useful, as it is easy enough to fight them with a weapon with Sharpness.

Besides melee combat, shooting spiders with a bow or attacking them with a lava bucket are also effective battle strategies.

#### Cave spiders

See also: Cave spider

Cave spiders appear only in mineshafts, where they are spawned by monster spawners. Cave spiders are smaller than a regular spider, meaning they can fit through 1×1 holes, and their bite poisons the player (except on Easy difficulty). On Normal difficulty, the Poison effect lasts for 6 seconds and on Hard it lasts for 15 seconds, if not countered by drinking a milk bucket or a honey bottle. 

Poison can't kill on its own, but it can lower your health to 1, which makes you very vulnerable to attacks of any other mob, including melee attack of cave spiders, which deal only 2 to 3, same as regular spiders.

Cave spider spawners are often difficult to take out, due to their location being surrounded by cobwebs. If you run across a cave spider spawner, make sure you have shears or a sword to cut the cobwebs quickly (a sword is used up very fast by this). Another great option to get rid of the webs is to wash them off with a water bucket. You can also tunnel under the floor to reach them, then mine upward and break the spawner. Neither type of spider is affected by the cobweb slowing effect, so be aware that they cannot get stuck as other mobs and entities can.

Cave spiders have only 12 × 6 points of health, but hitting them with a melee weapon might be tricky due to very small hitbox and fast movements. Thus it is recommended to use a sword rather than an axe, similar to vexes. In Java Edition, some ways to achieve the one-hit kill include:

- Netherite sword + critical hit;
- Iron sword + Sharpness V + critical hit;
- Strength I + diamond sword + Sharpness III.

Cave spiders are also considered arthropods and the enchantment Bane of Arthropods deals higher damage to them, although the enchantment is rarely useful, as it is easy enough to fight them with a weapon with Sharpness.

#### Drowned

See also: Drowned

Another variants of zombies. Drowned spawn in oceans, rivers and underwater ruins‌[Java Edition  only]. Normal zombies can also drown in water and be converted into drowned after 30 seconds.

Most drowned are easy to kill, like normal zombies (remember about Smite enchantment), but some spawn holding a trident, which can be dangerous if you are not protected with good armor, as they deal 8 damage when thrown and 16 × 8 in melee. Attempting to kill a trident-holding drowned with no armor results in a high chance of dying. They only attack you during the daytime if you are in water, but at night, drowned attack you on the shore as well.

In Bedrock Edition, drowned stop using ranged attacks when you are 3 blocks or less away from the drowned, so you can easily prevent drowned from throwing the trident by moving in as close as possible and defeating it.

Besides Smite, other useful tactics against drowned with tridents include: 

- shooting them from far away with a bow/crossbow;
- using ashieldto deflect the trident;
- hiding behind walls or even other mobs;
- enchanting armor withProtection.

If you want maximum defense against tridents, enchant one armor piece with Projectile Protection IV and other three with Protection IV. Be aware that this lowers your defense against other types of damage, like explosions.

#### Iron golems

See also: Iron golem

In Bedrock Edition, neutral iron golems spawn in villages containing 10 or more villagers and at least 21 houses (counted as beds), while in Java Edition, neutral iron golems spawn when villagers gossip about golems. They have high health (100 × 50) and do massive damage, but the exact amount is randomized: on Normal difficulty, they deal betweem 7.5 × 3.75 and 21.5 × 10.75. Iron golems throw players into the air, which causes even more damage from falling. They take no knockback and receive no fall damage or drowning damage.

A rather easy way to kill iron golems is to pillar up 3 blocks tall on a flat surface (away from any nearby blocks the golem could stand on to reach you), and attack while it's out of reach. Minimum height of the pillar is exactly 2.75 blocks (2 blocks + an enchanting table). Punching the golem and then building the pillar is faster, but not recommended, especially if you aren't skilled in combat.

Ranged weaponry (bows, crossbows and tridents) is a safer alternative against iron golems, as they are extremely deadly at hand-to-hand combat. One can also use lava, fire, or a pack of wolves to slay the golem.

Finally, you can aggro a golem, then run into a nearby house, stand just beyond the door frame and hit the golem. You should be careful, as it may still hit you if you move too close.

However, note that killing a village's iron golem lowers the player's reputation there, causing future iron golems to become hostile automatically.
