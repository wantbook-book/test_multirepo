Note: For Xperia Play owners using the gamepad, while in creative mode, the lowest two rows of items are beneath the screen, and one cannot scroll down to see them. They are still accessible, but it requires either remembering how many times one has to press the directional buttons to access them, or trial-and-error. This is most prominent in the 4.0 update, as the amount of items has increased, and now sixteen items are hidden. The only way to see them is to turn on the option to use touch controls in the options menu.

### Legacy Console Edition
#### Notes
- On thePlayStation Vita Edition(when playing on the PlayStation Vita),Wii U Edition(when playing on the Wii U GamePad), andNintendo Switch Edition(when playing in Tabletop or Handheld mode), the touchscreen can be used to control the tooltips shown at the bottom of the screen (if enabled), as well as the menus and inventory.
	- Likewise, on thePlayStation 4 Edition, the Touch pad can be used to move the inventory cursor as well as control the menus by swiping.
- TheWii U Editioncan be played with a Wii U GamePad, Wii U Pro Controller, Classic Controller, or Classic Controller Pro. It can not be played with a Wii Remote, Wii Remote Plus, or Nunchuk.
	- Note: While theWii U Editioncan not be played with a Wii Remote or Wii Remote Plus, a Wii Remote or Wii Remote Plus is required to play with a Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro.
