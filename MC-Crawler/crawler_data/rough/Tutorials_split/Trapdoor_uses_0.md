# Tutorials/Trapdoor uses
This tutorial demonstrates some uses of the trapdoor. Trapdoors can be used in a variety of ways, whether it's a mob farm, a drawbridge, or a secret entrance.

## Drawbridge
An example of a drawbridge
If you place the trapdoors in a trench in this fashion:

You can create a fairly good drawbridge; You can extend it lengthways and its widthways. It's possible to walk on the ledge of an opened trapdoor if there is enough space above it. To create a drawbridge in this fashion that is not vulnerable to ledge walking, so long as there is an overhang 2 blocks above the ground before the trapdoors start. Trapdoors can also be used with lava underneath.

## Sewer
Do the same with the drawbridge, then in the pit (make the pit only 1 block tall) add water, the amount of water you put is the amount of trapdoors wide. Only add water at the beginning of the sewer,if the sewer runs out of water (after 7-8 blocks) make the pit one block lower where the last water block is. Now, you can decorate it. Add mossy cobble at the sides and for added effect, connect it to a house, or make a whole water system in a town.

## Entrance to Underground
Example of entrance with mechanisms underneath
You can make a useful entrance to underground by using trapdoors. It can be controlled by Redstone using Redstone, Redstone Torches, and possibly if you want it automated, Redstone Repeaters. Obviously, you can use different objects that give charges instead of Pressure Plates.

## Minecart Entrance
Similarly to making entrances underground you can use trapdoors to drop your minecart onto track underneath making an automatic entrance (good for keeping hostile mobs out, making it convenient getting into your base). It can be powered by the rail detector so the trapdoors will only be open for a short period of time. A minecart will not fall through a single trapdoor (a 2Ã—3 trapdoor setup works fine).

## Anti Zombie Door
Trapdoors can be used as an alternative to a wooden door. The advantage of this is that zombies will not attempt to break down the trapdoor, making your house zombie free. This is particularly useful in Hard difficulty, as zombies will not go into your house.

## Retractable Stairs
You can make retractable stairs with trapdoors. Basically, you need a staircase of trapdoors, with the "hinge" on the wall, and a channel in the wall next to it for the Redstone wire. A lever can then be used at the top and/or bottom to extend or retract the staircase.

## Traps
Traps can be built by placing lava or water underneath trapdoors and wiring redstone circuits and pressure plates to them. This can be used as a 'reverse drawbridge' or underground to trap mobs or other players.

## Launching Pad
It is also possible to create a minecart launching pad by placing two trapdoors side by side. Now connect the trapdoors with a button/lever and one redstone wire. Then build 2 ramps with minecart tracks. One should lead to your launch pad and the second one should be built under your trapdoors. If you build 2 minecart launching pads side by side, it would allow you to create a minecart racetrack. Just put your minecart on the top of the upper ramp, enter it and wait until you're on the trapdoor and press the button to start.
