## Griefing clients

  


The contents of this section are not supported by Mojang Studios or the Minecraft Wiki.


While modifications to Minecraft clients are fairly popular with legitimate mods, griefers also often employ client modifications to aid their efforts. Apart from the mods below, griefing clients often include an in-game GUI to display enabled mods, as well as things such as chat commands (".commands") and keybinds to easily turn hacks on and off.

Warning: It is not recommended to purchase paid hacked clients, as the people behind them can never be trusted (whether they are bad programmers, scammers, untrustworthy, etc.). Hacked clients also never last forever; various paid hacked clients have been discontinued. Thus, if you pay money for a hacked client, you'll only be getting some months of usage until the hacked client gets discontinued. It will be a huge risk and a waste of your time. Never use cracked paid clients, they can ruin your computer with malware.

A hacked client, showing its in-game GUI.
- Crash: A hack that allows a player to teleport themselves to theWorld borderand back by flying insanely fast between the Farlands and spawn. This usually crashes servers instantly and can only be combated with NoCheatPlus.
- Kill Aura/Forcefield/Aimbot: Kill auras, and similar mods called ForceFields, automatically attack any players or mobs within range of the player.
- Build: Build hacks are simply modifications that instantly place blocks in a predetermined pattern. Common builds include cubes, pillars, swastikas, and platforms.
- Critical: This hack is used to make sure you always hit a critical attack upon another player and/or mob. There's one which forces it without actually jumping, and one which jumps before attacking. Both are effective.
- ESP: This hack draws a 3D box around a player, which is viewable from a long distance and through blocks to locate them. In some cases, it also displays some info, such as the object in hand, armor, or coordinates.
- FastPlace: This modification eliminates the normal delay when placing blocks. This may also be applied to placing eggs in order to create a lot of entities in a short amount of time. Rebinding theusekey to certain keys on the keyboard increases the click rate to 20[verify]clicks per second, making this feature possible in vanilla Minecraft.
- ThroworEgg: A hack similar to FastPlace. The difference is that while FastPlace very rapidly places blocks and throws entities, Throw is used to throw a lot of entities such as eggs or snowballs instantly. It can be used to lag the server.
- FlightorFly: Not necessarily used just for griefing, this hack gives the user the ability toflysimilar to as if they were inCreativemode, often at adjustable speed levels like inSpectatormode.
- Spider: This mod, similar to but less obvious as flight, causes every block the player encounters to be treated as if it had vines, allowing access to areas not normally accessible, used for griefing and especially for PvP.
- Freecam: This mod allows the user to separate themselves from their body and fly around to scout out areas. Since infinite reach was patched, the user of this mod cannot affect any blocks outside their reach radius. However, this hack can be used to peek into obsidian bases, and open chests within the player's reach distance.
- Fullbright: This hack lights up all blocks as if they were in direct sunlight, even in pitch blackness. The addition of the "Night Vision" potion enables this feature to be obtainable in vanilla Minecraft, and it's possible by editing the gamma within the options.txt file (line 4, in-game called Brightness, ranging from 0.0 (moody) to 1.0 (bright)) to 12.0 or more.
- Godmode: This makes the user invincible, preventing them from being able to take damage. Almost all versions of this hack have been patched, but there are still some versions that exist.
- HighJump: This allows the player to jump higher than normal, often at an adjustable jump height.
- NoFall: This hack prevents damage from being taken when falling from high areas. This was implemented into vanilla in the form of/gamerule fallDamage.
- NukerorAnnihilator: This destroys all blocks within reach automatically and quickly. They are also often configurable, allowing the user to destroy only certain block types.
- Sneak: This allows griefers to sneak indefinitely, and without being slowed down. This will keep their nameplates hidden behind walls just as if they were holding the sneak button.
- SpamorFlood: This allows the client to send a large number of chat messages to the server, and often very quickly. This is partially patched in vanilla, with the "disconnect.spam" kick message if you send messages too fast. Copying and continuous pasting a message into the chat provides a similar effect, usually at slower speeds than mods.
- SpeedMineorFastBreak: This allows the user to break blocks much faster than normal. It does not usually work on blocks such as obsidian, however.
- InstantorOneClick: Similar to yet different from SpeedMine. Instant and OneClick both allow the user to click blocks once without holding their mouse down, and a short time after, the block will break as if they had clicked and held to break it. This makes it easier to destroy multiple blocks quickly.
- Step: This modification allows for the user to simply walk up multiple blocks as if they wereslabs. The number of blocks is usually adjustable.
- Tracers: This hack draws a line, which starts at the crosshair and ends at another player's position. It is used to locate a player accurately.
- X-RayorWallhack: Stops the rendering of any block besides ores desirable to the griefer. This hack is often used to find chests or valuable minerals such as diamond. It can be partially prevented using Bukkit server plugins that disguise ores and chests that are not adjacent to transparent blocks. People, however, have made resource packs that only have ore block textures, bypassing cheat detectors.
- SprintorSpeed: This will make the player sprint at the normal sprint speed, or faster. Most of the time, this will not deplete hunger. Other speed hacks can make you run at several times normal speed, enabling you to travel huge distances in a short time.
- AutoSoup: This will automatically eatmushroom stew, which in turn heals typically 3 hearts of health. This modification is only useful on servers where mushroom stew heals health, typically Kit/Faction PVP servers. When this mod is used, the soup is usually taken from inside the inventory and when the bowls are empty, they get stacked inside the inventory.
- AutoTool: Upon the player clicking on a block, this hack will automatically switch to the most efficient tool in the player's hot bar to break, or to harvest, the block. There are also more advanced and well-designed AutoTools, which will select the tool based on factors such as enchantments, durability, and whether or not you want speed of breaking the block over the ability to harvest the block (for example, swords can break some blocks faster without harvesting the actual block, while shears can harvest some blocks, but not break them as fast).
- AutoRespawn: Upon the death of the player, this hack will automatically send a respawn packet to the server, resulting in the player respawning without the need for clicking the "Respawn" button. Most AutoRespawn hacks are poorly designed, so if you died in hardcore mode, the hack would still send a packet, causing the screen to freeze. Some anticheats, such as Spartan, attempt to counter AutoRespawns by testing for how fast the server receives the packet, but this is a very ineffective way to detect the hack, albeit being one of the only ways. Later made vanilla as a gamerule inJava Edition(doImmediateRespawn) and Bedrock Edition (immediateRespawn).
