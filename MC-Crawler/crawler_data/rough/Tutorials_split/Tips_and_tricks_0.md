# Tutorials/Tips and tricks
Here are some tips and short suggestions by the Minecraft community that do not fit neatly under one section of tutorials. This page is for players who are new or returning to Minecraft. Remember, however, there are hints that are frequent within the 'Trivia' section of a topic's page, which are likely to have an in-depth description of each tip.

## Controls
Controls can be fully customized in nearly all versions of Minecraft. By opening settings and navigating to the Controls option, the player can change their key mappings to whatever they wish. In Bedrock Edition, touchscreen, keyboard and mouse, or controller may be used to control the game. However, Java Edition supports only keyboard and mouse control. Additional control settings like auto jump and toggle/hold for sprint and sneaking can be changed in the Controls menu.

## Finding directions
Within the Minecraft world, a compass is not how you tell direction! Instead, it always points to a fixed location, the world spawn.  Yet, it can be useful to know which way is north.  

Here's a few ways:

- North can be found by hitting a block. During themininganimation, check the directions the cracks appear on block as it is mined.
	- This may not work if aresource packchanges the cracking pattern for blocks.
	- First, learn the crack pattern.  If a block is hit on its side, there should be one crack going almost straight up, one to the right, and one going almost straight down.
	- If a block on the ground is hit, the same crack pattern appears. The crack that went almost straight up on the side of the block, points north on the top of a block.
- You can watch which direction the sun, moon, stars, or clouds are moving.  Each of these always moves from east to west.
- In Java Edition, thedebug screen(activated by pressingF3) gives information about which way the player is facing.
- If you have amap(Locator mapin Bedrock Edition) covering where you are, the map shows an arrow-like player icon.  This points the same way that you are facing in the world.  The top of the map is north, the right edge is east, and so on.

## Changing the rules
### Peaceful mode
If you are having too much difficulty with hostile mobs, such as a zombie or a creeper or can't find any food to eat, you may be able to set the world difficulty to Peaceful. When you change to peaceful mode, hunger and health quickly regenerate, the hunger bar never decreases, and all hostile mobs instantly despawn. 

However, this is a controversial move â€” in a pure survival game, many players consider it to be cheating, which takes away much of what they see as the challenge and fun of Minecraft, especially when used as a "panic button".  That said, it's better than a ragequit, and Minecraft is meant to accommodate many different styles of play. Others may consider this a challenge as it limits the player's ability to gather certain resources. 

When the "point" of your own game is more about construction or artistic builds than about surviving the monsters, peaceful mode becomes helpful.   It can also be used as a "training" mode to learn the game controls and get used to the Minecraft world.

Single-player worlds have an option to lock world difficulties and eliminate this option, keeping you "honest" in the gameplay; for multi-player worlds, you cannot change the world's difficulty unless you are the world owner (or at least an "op").

### Game rules
Main article: game rule
Another option for moderating the game difficulty is to alter the game rules with "cheat commands". As with peaceful mode, these are controversial, but in single-player... well, it's your game. On a multi-player server, you probably cannot change these rules in any case, unless you are the server owner. See the linked page for full details.

- The most powerful rule forSurvival modeiskeepInventory.
	- Once set to "true", players who die respawn with their items and experience instead of dropping their equipment andexperience orbswhere they died. Having a lot of valuable items like diamond armor, a diamond sword, diamonds, gold, and iron, causes you to fear having all your hard work come to nothing. Unfortunately, this means that if you dug a hole into lava, all of the items that you were carrying are lost forever. Therefore, altering this rule is quite useful.
- Another, less controversial, rule, ismobGriefing.
	- This prevents all mobs from breaking blocks, picking up items, or trampling your crops.  Most obviously, this prevents creepers and endermen from damaging your builds; it also prevents mobs from picking up your items after your death.
		- This also prevents villagers frombreeding, because they need to collect food to do so.
		- Stops chickens from laying eggs.
		- Sheep no longer eat grass and cannot be sheared again, breaking functionality of wool farms.
		- It also has significant effects in the Nether (ghasts, blazes, piglins) and drastically affects the late-gamewitherfight, and theender dragonbattle.

Since version 1.16 on Java and Bedrock Editions, game rules can be adjusted during the creation of a world. This allows for a customised experience without having "Allow Cheats" on, if you prefer to play with cheats otherwise disabled.
