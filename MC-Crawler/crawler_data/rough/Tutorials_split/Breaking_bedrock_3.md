##### Pros
- Few materials required
- Reusable
- Easy to use

#### Method 4
[Bug Used: MC-91486], patched in 1.13 and above.

This method is much simpler, but it requires more resources. These are the minimum materials you will need to break one block:

- Onedragon egg
- One piston
- Oneredstone torch
- 31-481 redstone[note 1]
- 33-513 blocks of choice[note 1]
- 2-32 redstone repeaters[note 1]
- 1 lever

1. â†‘ a b cThis amount varies greatly on render distance. The amount of redstone you will need is 15 times the render distance. The number of repeaters you will need is the same as the render distance. The number of blocks you will need is 16 times the render distance, plus 1.

This method is incredibly easy to do, but time-consuming. This is all you need to do:

1. Place one block of choice.
2. Place a redstone torch on the side of this block.
3. Place a piston on top of the redstone torch.
4. Place the dragon egg on top of the piston arm. This dragon egg should be exactly above the block you are trying to break.
5. Place the remaining blocks in a straight line with redstone on top of it. Place repeaters every 16 blocks of this redstone line. At the other end of this, place a lever.
6. Power the lever, wait five seconds, then depower it.
7. Walk back to find the dragon egg taking up the space of the broken block.

This works because the dragon egg is dropped in the lazy chunks. Lazy chunks are a region two chunks wide at the edge of the player's render distance that are partly loaded and have not yet been unloaded. Redstone still works, but falling block entities fall instantly. Dragon eggs have the strange property where they replace the block they fall on with itself, if they fall in the lazy chunks.

Pros:

- It can be expanded to break more bedrock in one go, if the player manages to obtain more dragon eggs. This can be done using agravity block duplicator.
- Since it uses a falling block, the player can construct this any number of blocks above the one being broken.

Cons:

- This method requires a block underneath the target block for the dragon egg to rest on after it falls. The egg will keep breaking blocks under it until it comes to rest on a solid block, which cannot exist at y=0.
- On multiplayer, other players may end up loading the chunks where this is happening, causing it to fail.
- It requires that you obtain a dragon egg, which might require lots of convincing other players in multiplayer if you weren't the first person to kill the Ender Dragon.

#### Method 5
This can be done in a variety of different ways because it uses certain plants with block-breaking properties.

##### Bamboo
In Bedrock Edition, growing bamboo with bone meal removes the block above. See this video for how to quickly remove strips of bedrock.
This method no longer works in 1.10.0.

##### Jungle Trees
(Bug Used: MC-10176) (patched)

The branches of huge jungle trees replace blocks that they generate in.

##### Huge Mushrooms
Huge mushrooms break the blocks that their caps spawn in.

This method no longer works in 1.13.2

Pros:

- These plants are extraordinarily easy to obtain.
- The method is cheap, requiring just a bit of bonemeal.

Cons:

- Plants are unpredictable, so you could be breaking blocks that you did not want to break.
- These plants have very strict space requirements, so fulfilling those and breaking the bedrock can take a lot of trial-and-error.

#### Method 6
(Bug used: MC-91528)

As of Minecraft 1.13, this method no longer works as described.

This method requires an indestructible end crystal and a piston.

To do this, push the end crystal with the piston into the block that you want to break. The block will break.

It works because indestructible end crystals constantly generate fire underneath them. This fire breaks all blocks, including bedrock.

Pros:

- It is insanely easy to accomplish once the materials are obtained.
- Lots of bedrock can be removed quickly with this method, through the use of a flying machine.

Cons:

- Indestructible end crystals are very difficult to obtain and move.
- It can be difficult to tell which block is being removed.

Fun fact: In the 1.8 update, no bedrock generated on the obsidian pillars because the crystals generated one block lower than they were supposed to. The fire generated broke the bedrock that was supposed to be there.
