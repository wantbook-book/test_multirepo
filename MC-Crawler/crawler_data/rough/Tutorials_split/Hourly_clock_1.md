## Configuration
(Note: you can also use a counter instead of repeaters for longer time.)
As there are 3 repeaters required to time a second, and 50 seconds in a Minecraft hour, there need to be repeaters configured in some way to make 500 ticks delay (1 tick = 0.1 seconds).

### 75-clock configuration
To set this clock to the right delay, set 50 of the repeaters to 4 ticks, and 25 to 2 ticks (or 62 repeaters to 4 ticks and one to 2 ticks.) This creates 25 seconds delay and, with the inverter setup on the chime, will sound the signal once every 50 seconds.



### Using a Hopper system
Using a hopper clock with 128 items will result in an output being sent out every 1 in game hour. It takes approximately 50.02 seconds for 128 items to travel from one hopper into another. Using this method results in a more compacted design for an hourly clock configuration can be done in any way. The video below shows how using droppers and comparators to display the hour. 




## Chimes
The chime is the part of the clock that tells you when an hour has passed. It is made of note blocks, and can be anything from a single note to a complex melody. A good idea is to build your chime under the floor of your base so that it is heard from inside home.

## Cool Ideas
These are just some other cool ideas for an hourly clock.

### Super Complex Clock
Make a giant complex housing 12 hourly clocks. Have each one chime the number of the hour, and rig the circuits so that each chime goes off 2 times a day. A T Flip-Flop counter and 4-bit to hexadecimal converters can be used to save space.

### Multibase Clock
If you want your clock to sound in all your bases, but don't want to build different clocks all over the map, it is possible to connect all your bases to the clock. This will mean more delay from repeaters needed to carry power the distance from clock to base, but you can just say that there are minute time zone differences across the map (or make every base have an equal delay). Then just build more chimes in your bases. The inverters can also be connected to different parts of your central clock to offset the delay caused by the repeaters.

### Clock Tower with 7-segment display
While this requires a lot of extra work (as well as extra Redstone) this clock could tell the time over great distancesâ€”at least far greater than 48 blocks.

### Timed Stations
Link a clock of any time period to a powered rails controlling minecarts within a station, making minecarts leave at uniform intervals. Additionally, the station can be placed nearby a visible clock display to determine accurate timetables and tell players when the next carts will leave or arrive.
