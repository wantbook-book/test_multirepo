#### Chain reaction
You can wire up your traps with some rube goldberg wiring. As well as looking cool, some of these things can be deadly. Take Greenstone as an example; you could stack a lot of sand on the sand, and when it falls, the player will fall through it and when it lands, they won't be able to breathe anymore. Get as creative as possible.

#### Funbox
Funboxes are 3×3×3 rooms of spawners that are very hard to disable.

##### Types of funboxes
Deathdome: Use MCedit or commands to make primed TNT spawners. Set them to 1 tick minimum and 20 ticks maximum. Set to 8 ticks as current time. Add a spawning range. Don't forget to cover the room with obsidian including the spawners or weep! When the players enter the room, hundreds of TNT will explode right into their faces! Add diamond armor for them. 


Don't look: Add endermen spawners. Make the room out of bedrock. When the players look at the endermen, they will attack them! Don't say I didn't warn you!


Monster maker: Add random hostile mob spawners. Then it will be chaos!


Meat room: If you are feeling nice, then add a reward with a funbox of pig spawners so players can kill them for food? Add fire aspect swords or a furnace with a chest of coal. If you don't want players killing pigs, then add a cooked pork funbox.


Potion funbox: Make a funbox out of positive potion spawners (add negatives for the lulz.). Also, put it in an enchanting room!


Buried alive: Make a funbox out of falling sand or gravel spawners. (Add the rare anvil.) Fill the large room with sand. Give the players some stone shovels. Add blockades to the room. Set the spawning cooldown to 4 ticks minimum to 5 ticks maximum. Set the current spawning cooldown time to 4 ticks. When players dig up the sand, the room will rapidly start to fill up with sand and then they will die! Give them one torch each to remove some of the gravel.


That hurt!: Make an arrow spawner. This is better than the dispenser one since it has unlimited ammo. Add leather armor for them.

#### 
Make a detector that detects players that switched to peaceful, then create a command block that teleports them to another room. Make a sign saying:


You have switched to peaceful and therefore you must complete this "peaceful" map to continue.


Make a command block that clears their items from their inventory. Make a new spawnpoint for the unlucky player in a bedrock room with no way out. Make a map that is near impossible to complete. (E.g. Parkour map.) Add a few small rewards for the player to progress. Make the level really long with no checkpoints. When the player reaches the end, make a hidden button teleporting to the end of the adventure map in a good way. (WARNING: Contains spoilers) In the bedrock room, make a sign saying: 


GAME OVER. You have failed the sudden death challenge on this map and you need to re-download the map.

You could also take the post down after a certain amount of views is reached, so they'll never be able to download it again, allowing for bigger consequences if they fail the map.

#### The Test Series
Create a series of challenges, where if you fail, you get teleported to the next test. But, if you win, you get a reward like armor and a sword. After a certain amount of tests have them go to the End and fight the ender dragon with their current equipment. This is a...

#### Bullethell
Use command blocks to shoot projectiles such as arrows and fireballs at the player, or even spawn entire blocks of lava that the player needs to dodge. Custom death messages are optional but can be added.

#### Elytra Crawlspace
Create an upside-down slab tunnel which is only accessible by using elytra. Fill it with spiders or silverfish to add some enemies to fight. (deprecated: as of 1.13, you can swim through, and as of 1.14, you can crawl through.)

### Some redstone tips
- Powering unpowered redstone that's next to floating sand, gravel, water, or lava, will cause it to irreversibly obey physics.
- For a really nice map, having a large amount of command blocks can be good, but not always.  Sometimes 1 well thought out command can be better than 10 useless commands.

## Multiplayer map ideas
### Gold Rush
This map is for getting as much gold as possible. First, use commands to fill Y=1-Y=64 with stone, removing all ores and generated structure. Have 1 layer of grass blocks on Y=64, and turn off mob spawning and mob griefing. Set the difficulty to hard. Build a hollow barrier cube, 2048×2048 (l*w), all the way down to bedrock, and up to the world height limit. Then, make a layer of diamond blocks at Y=40, and a layer of gold ore at Y=10. Have eight bedrock cubicles, one for each player/team, with two floors each. On the first floor, of the cubicle, include only an entrance to the barrier arena. Have 6 furnaces and a chest with mining supplies. Only include one iron pickaxe for each team member. For the rest of the items, add only one iron shovel, one stack of wood, cobblestone, coal, and torches, and 2*(#of players) stacks of food. On the second floor, include a double chest, for all the gold ingots. Have the judge in the center of the arena with a 12 hour hopper clock linked to bells around the whole arena. Cover 8 wither skeleton spawners with barrier in a way that lets the skeletons spawn. Give each person/team a sapling.
