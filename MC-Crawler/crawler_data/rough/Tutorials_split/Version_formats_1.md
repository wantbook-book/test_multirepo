## Bedrock Edition
### Alpha
Originally subtitled Pocket Edition, versions in this development phase took the form of a "v" followed by three numbers: phase, major, and minor, followed by the word "alpha". The phase number during Alpha was 0, and the major and minor numbers incremented each release (when the major version number was incremented, the minor version was reset to 0). Development builds in this phase were labeled as their parent version followed by "build" and the build counter. For example, v0.14.0 alpha build 1 was the first build for Alpha version 0.14.0.

### Release
Release versions kept the same format as in Alpha, but incremented the phase number to 1. Development versions in this time were known as "alpha" versions (not to be confused with the development phase called "alpha") and took the form of the word "alpha" followed by a four-digit version number (major.minor.patch.revision[6]). The first three digits are the parent version (alpha 1.0.0.1 was a development build for 1.0.0) and the fourth number is the build revision, which is not necessarily incremented by 1 each release.

In 1.2.0, the "Pocket Edition' " was dropped, and development versions were renamed from "alpha" to "beta"; the version number format did not change (e.g., beta 1.8.0.8 was a development build for 1.8.0).

Starting from 1.16.0 and onwards, Bedrock Edition major version numbers match Java Edition.[7][8] Before this, Bedrock Edition updates changed the major version number for content updates and the minor version number for patches. So in order to keep the major version the same as Java Edition, large minor version numbers are now used for supplementary updates. This allows space for platform-specific patches to be released while content updates are in development.[9] The minor version segment now uses up to three digits to denote the content of that version. Incrementing the first digit (e.g., 1.16.200) represents a major supplementary content update, incrementing the second digit (e.g., 1.16.210) represents a minor supplementary update, while incrementing the third digit (e.g., 1.16.201) represents a bug-fix supplementary update.

## Legacy Console Edition
The many different console versions use entirely different versioning formats. Xbox 360 Edition versions used "title updates": the letters "TU" followed by a number. Xbox One Edition updates were called "content updates" and use the same format as Xbox 360 but with the letters "CU" instead of "TU". As mandated by PlayStation software, PlayStation Editions used a decimal three-digit version number (an integer followed by a two-digit number from 00–99, starting from 1.00; version 1.99 must be followed by 2.00), which may sometimes skip numbers. Wii U Edition versions are known as "Patches", and used the word "Patch" followed by a number. Nintendo Switch Edition versions used a full three-digit version number starting from 1.0.1, but only incremented the minor version each release.
