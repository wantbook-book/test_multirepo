### Armory
An armory is a room near the front door with chests containing food, armor; and weapons, this is for easy access when you are going outside, and so you can quickly prepare yourself to explore and collect items. For an even faster alternative, this room consists of a number of dispensers, activated by a single button or pressure plate, providing the adventurous player a way to get started immediately. This is useful for exploring dangerous caves and going on night expeditions.

### Smithing room
After building an anvil, you might want to make a room with a crafting table, a smithing table, a chest, easy access to an enchanting room, and of course the anvil. Handy if you fight monsters or other players a lot.

### Nether portal room
See also: Nether portal

Once you have at least 10 obsidian, either from mining it in a cavern or obtaining it through obsidian farming you can build a nether portal. Once built, activate it with a flint and steel, and you can travel to the the Nether. This can be used for fast travel and for getting lava, netherrack, soul sand, nether quartz ore and glowstone. Beware of ghasts, zombie pigmen and blazes as well as magma cubes. Building another nether portal room in the nether for protection is a recommended idea. Please note cobblestone is a good block to build with in the Nether since ghasts can't destroy it with their fireballs.

Note: the player can potentially create a cabin with all of these.

## Expansions
These projects, while not entirely mandatory, make your base more useful and interesting.

### Trading Hall
A trading hall is a location to gather villagers to trade with. This is the type of thing an advanced player with a lot of time on their hands, or a bored Creative player, would do. With a few farms, these can make perfect equipment and food with just a bit of time.   

### Tower
A tower is good for checking if any mobs have come into your base like creepers or spiders then you can fight them off. It is also good for a bedroom because ground based mobs can not get to your bed. Though It can take time to make one and  if you want it to be high it can use up all your blocks.

### Kitchen
This is basically a crafting room, but you only craft food. The chest(s) should contain most basic foods, including wheat, milk, eggs, etc. Many people, instead of having a kitchen, just craft food in the crafting room, but a kitchen is a nice expansion, because it separates crafting materials so that you don't fill your crafting room's chests with wheat instead of wood. You could also add a smoker if you want. 

** Bakery **
This is basically an expansion of a kitchen. You could build this and a kitchen, and just connect them. You would use this to make cakes, pumpkin pies and bread. Place a crafting table, chest, and, if you want, a display table for cakes. If you want to make a large amount of cakes, make a cake farm under or near the bakery.

** Pantry **
This is also an expansion of a kitchen. Make sure that they are categorized so you don't get mixed up. You can use a chest or dispenser to use everything in them. Put some cooked meat, bread, cookies, cakes and melons in them.

Note: If you are using a dispenser, you need to activate it with a redstone signal.

### Control room
This is a common room to find in most advanced player's houses, but only if said advanced player uses a lot of redstone in their builds. It controls all of the redstone devices a player has and usually consists of:

- Levers/Buttons/Other Input Methods—These are used to activate/deactivate redstone signals.
- Redstone torches/Redstone lamps—These are mainly used to determine whether the signals are on or off.
- Signs—These are probably the most important thing you can have in your control room. These help you determine what each lever/button does.

### Maze
This is mainly for if you get bored. It's quite simple and obvious how to build and use.

### 
An experience farm uses water currents to push most mobs into a central area. With mobs in the nether, pistons are used. Use a piston crusher or a long drop to get the mobs to a ½ heart. Mobs can be killed by hand or with a splash potion of harming (Healing for undead mobs) to get XP. Note: This is more efficient with multiple spawners, as more spawners mean more spawning opportunities. You also obtain drops from each mob killed. This can also be done with large dark rooms with platforms. The mobs spawn and fall into water currents, where you can choose what happens to them once they are out of the spawning chamber.

### Rebuilding wall
If for some reason you want to have a wall that you can’t get rid of, you can make a cobblestone generator, and make pistons push the cobblestone (which reforms) up into the wall, unless there are no missing blocks in it. Look at Sethbling's channel for more information or Mumbo Jumbo's indestructible wall V2

### In-Shelter Teleporter Room
If you have Cheats enabled, you can create a room that teleports you to other rooms in your shelter. you need command blocks and basic knowledge of using commands to make the room. A non-cheat method is to build an ender pearl stasis chamber, which can teleport you to any room. This requires ender pearls so you need an enderman farm.

### Redstone lab
A laboratory is a large, clear, secure area where you can safely test designs without distractions. When building large redstone projects with complicated parts, it can save you time and effort if you test the ideas first. However, it's often best to test ideas in creative mode and implement them in survival.
