## We Need to Go Deeper
Build, light, and enter a Nether Portal

Requirements: Enter the Nether dimension.

You will need to build a nether portal, or find a ruined portal and fix it. To make a portal, you need at least 10 blocks of obsidian. Make your portal using the obsidian like so (build it upright, or else it will not work): 

|  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

If you find a ruined portal, you wouldn't need to build an entire portal frame on your own, but you do need to fix it up to be complete. Depending on how broken (and large) the ruined portal is, it might be easier or harder to fix it than to make your own. In order to fix a ruined portal, you need to mine any crying obsidian in the portal (except for the corners, because these don't count); a diamond pickaxe works best for that. Then complete the portal by placing regular obsidian in the gaps. There is a chest near the portal that may contain some obsidian to help you with this, but it's likely that you will have to get some on your own anyway. The chest also may contain a fire charge or flint and steel, which will light the portal, even if you can't fix the ruined portal and decide to make your own.

Now you need a way to light the portal to activate it. This could be a flint and steel or a fire charge. If you don't have either of these, you need to get an iron ingot and a piece of flint and place these anywhere in your 2×2 crafting grid to make a flint and steel.

| Ingredients           | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Iron Ingot+<br/>Flint |                 |

Flint has a 10% chance to drop when mining gravel if mined without Silk Touch. It can also generate in villages (fletcher's house) and ruined portal chests. Light your portal by using the flint and steel or fire charge on the top surface of one of the bottom obsidian blocks. You can also light the nether portal by placing lava next to flammable blocks, or through a lightning strike. (Note that for those methods to work, a fire block must appear inside of the frame). If the portal doesn't light up, make sure that it is complete and the correct size, does not contain any crying obsidian (only regular obsidian), and does not have blocks inside the frame, then try again. Your portal should now look like this:

|  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

Once you stand inside the portal for 4 seconds, you will be teleported to the Nether and you will get the advancement. If you are not prepared to go into the Nether, go back to the Overworld the moment you set foot in the Nether. To return, step out of the portal and step back in again.

## Cover Me With Diamonds
Diamond armor saves lives

Requirements: Have any type of diamond armor in your inventory.

Diamond armor can be crafted like so:

| Name               | Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|--------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Diamond Helmet     | Diamond     |                 |
| Diamond Chestplate | Diamond     |                 |
| Diamond Leggings   | Diamond     |                 |
| Diamond Boots      | Diamond     |                 |

Diamond armor can also spawn in bastions, end cities, woodland mansions, and ancient cities. It has a very small chance to drop when killing zombies, skeletons or their variants. It can also be bought from armorer villagers.

You will get the advancement when you put one of the pieces of armor in your inventory.

## Enchanter
Enchant an item at an Enchanting Table

Requirements: Enchant an item at an enchanting table.

First, craft an enchanting table:

| Ingredients                     | Crafting recipe |
|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| Book+<br/>Diamond+<br/>Obsidian |                 |

There are a few methods of obtaining books. First, you can craft them from leather and paper.

Leather drops from cows, mooshrooms, horses, donkeys, mules, llamas, trader llamas, hoglins, and some foxes (a fox can sometimes spawn holding a leather, which always drops upon death). It can also be obtained by fishing, bartering, or by crafting from 4 rabbit hide.

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Rabbit Hide |                 |

Sugar cane generates naturally near bodies of water—oceans, rivers or lakes. Paper can also generate in villages (cartographer's house), shipwrecks, and stronghold libraries. When you have enough materials, you can make a book.

| Name  | Ingredients        | Crafting recipe |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Paper | Sugar Cane         |                 |
| Book  | Paper+<br/>Leather |                 |

A bookshelf drops 3 books if broken without using Silk Touch. Bookshelves generate as a block in village library houses, woodland mansions, and stronghold libraries. Book can also be obtained by disenchanting an enchanted book at a grindstone. Finally, books can generate in village plains and desert houses, shipwrecks, stronghold libraries and ancient cities.

Now, when you have a book, you can make an enchanting table.

To enchant, you will need an enchantable tool, weapon, a piece of armor or another book. You will also need between 1 and 3 pieces of lapis lazuli, which can be found in ore form between levels -64 and 64, being much more common in underwater caves than in dry caves. Lapis can also be found in item form in desert village temples, mineshafts and shipwrecks. A block of lapis lazuli can rarely generate in a woodland mansion, which can be turned into 9 pieces of lapis lazuli.

| Ingredients           | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Block of Lapis Lazuli | 9               |

Also, make sure you have plenty of experience levels, as you will need them to enchant.

Place down the enchanting table and use it. Put lapis lazuli and your item of choice into two slots inside of the table, and select one of three enchant choices on the right.
