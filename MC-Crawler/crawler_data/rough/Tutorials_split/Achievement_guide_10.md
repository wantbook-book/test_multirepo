Goal: Kill a Pillager Captain.

There are 2 ways to find pillager captains, from pillager patrols or from pillager outposts. Pillager outposts can be found in biomes where villages can generate. Pillager captains can be easily distinguished between other pillagers as this pillager will be wearing a ominous banner on their head. Kill this mob and you will get achievement, plus the Bad Omen effect.

### 

Goal: Walk in a Village with the Bad Omen effect applied.

You can trigger a pillager raid after you get the Bad Omen effect, which obtained after you kill a raid captain. Just enter a village boundary (at least 1 villager with 1 claimed bed) and the raid will start.

Bells can be found in a village meeting point. They can be rung using redstone, projectile, or by pressing use on them. If you create your own village, bells are sold by armorer, toolsmith and weaponsmith villagers for 36 emeralds.

### 

Goal: Defeat a Ravager.

Ravagers spawn during the 3 waves in raids. These mobs have 100 × 50 and have high melee damage. It's recommended to defeat these mobs from a distance as blocking with a shield can stun ravagers and cause them to roar, knockbacking and dealing damage to nearby mobs except for other illagers. Since this mob can only use a melee attack, build a 3 block pillar and shoot the ravager using a bow or crossbow until it dies.

### Master Trader

Goal: Obtain 1,000 Emeralds from trading with Villagers.

This achievement can be easier with Hero of the Village effect, as it gives a trading discount, which lowers the price of items needed to trade with emeralds, so you require a fewer amount of items to exchange with emeralds.

As long you have huge crop farms, the best trade is crop trades from farmers as it can give you a huge amount of emeralds. Make sure to transform every villager in the village into farmer by placing as many composter as many villagers in villages, so they can restock their trades.

| Ingredients    | Crafting recipe |
|----------------|-----------------|
| AnyWooden Slab |                 |

You can sell wheat, beetroots, potatoes, carrots, pumpkins, melon slices, and eggs to farmer villagers. Trade with villagers until you get 1000 emeralds or 15 stack of emerald + 40 emeralds.

If you craft it into block of emerald, it's equal to 111 blocks of emeralds with one extra emerald or a full stack of a block of emeralds + 47 blocks of emeralds and one emerald left.

### Time for Stew

Goal: Give Someone a Suspicious Stew.

To complete this achievement, you must throw a suspicious stew at another player and have them pick it up. Having a fox pick it up does not work.
