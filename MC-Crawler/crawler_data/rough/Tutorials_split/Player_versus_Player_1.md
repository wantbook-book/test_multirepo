## Equipment for PvP
A combatant's equipment is a deciding factor in PvP, increasing one's survivability and damage output. Having good gear does not guarantee you success though, because skill is arguably a more important factor. Good gear can, however, greatly boost your chances in a fight. Players should be familiar with all aspects of equipment in order to effectively utilize them and assess the gear of their enemies'.

| Sword              | The sword is the most common and basic weapon for melee combat. The range of a sword is up to 3 blocks, making it the go to option for attacking other players in close proximity. A diamond sword enchanted withSharpnessV is capable of killing a player in unenchanted diamond armor in just 4 critical hits. However, the newly added netherite weapons deal exactly half a heart more of raw damage than their diamond counterparts. The sword deals far more damage per second than theaxe, and slightly higher knockback than other melee weapons, making it arguably the most effective. Swords also have the ability to perform a sweep attack‌[Java Edition  only], knocking back and slightly damaging other opponents near the initial hit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Axe                | The axe deals slightly more damage per hit than thesword‌[Java Edition  only]and can temporarily disableshields, but it has a slower attack speed. Despite these drawbacks, axes are effective weapons in PvP.‌[Java Edition  only]A critical strike with an unenchanted stone axe or better deals 9 hearts of damage to an unarmored player, 4.5 hearts of damage to a player with unenchanted iron armor, and 2 hearts to a player with unenchanted diamond armor. This means it can kill a full iron player in just 3 hits, and a full diamond player in 5 hits. If you're fighting an enemy in iron, keep in mind that you don't have to critical the third strike unless if they're trying to eat up, as they would have only 1 heart left after the second hit. Even if a sword can deal more damage, axes will always have a use in disabling shields.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Trident            | The trident is a versatile but, overall, poor weapon. It can be used for melee and distance combat, but best as a utility item. Once thrown, they do not slow down while underwater. They are best enchanted with Loyalty and Impaling. The other enchantments have their uses too, however. With Riptide, one can essentially fly with a source of water or rain. With Channeling, one can summon lightning to the trident's target during thunderstorms, exposing them and can also be used to make charged creepers, zombie pigmen, or witches. However, aside enchantments, they are somewhat lackluster as a weapon. They deal less damage than most axes but cannot disable shields, and attack too slowly to be used like swords.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Bow                | A fully charged bow not only deals more damage than adiamond sword, dealing 9despite attacking slower but it can also shoot up to 64 blocks upward, making it a powerful weapon from long range. Despite these advantages, a bow should not be used at close range as it has a 0.9-second charge time. The bows greatest drawback is that a shield will counter a bow in most scenarios as they can safely advance while holding it up. A well-enchanted bow is still recommended for high-level PvP as it can be used to pressure distant opponents and drain them of health and armor durability. By using tippedarrows, bows can also be used to inflict effects on players, such asPoisonon enemies. Arrow trajectories are affected by your motion in versions Java 1.9 and higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Crossbow           | The crossbow can be used like a bow shot with no charge time if pre-loaded. It deals 12 damage points, but keep in mind that it takes 3 seconds to reload and can't be enchanted with power, and in conditions when the other player(s) can see you, crossbows will put you at a disadvantage, because an ordinary bow has a shorter charging time than the reload rate of a crossbow. Enchanting a crossbow withQuick ChargeIII gives it the same charge time as a bow, greatly increasing its potential in PvP. It features its own enchantments and a slower recharge time then the bow and can shootfireworks. The maximum damage inflicted by its projectiles is 11× 5.5, and with the enchantmentMultishotit can shoot 3 at once. The player can alternatively use it as a weapon for sniping. If you shoot fireworks from crossbow with Multishot, it will deal 18 splash damage. However a crossbow with aPiercingis effective in combat as well, because the arrow goes through entities and bypasses shields, rendering the main defence against ranged weapons completely useless. In PVP crossbows are best used for their instant knockback potential, as even with multishot, harming arrows and fireworks, their damage against Protection 4 armor is minimal, making melee weapons far more deadly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Armor              | Armor allows players to absorb some of the damage dealt to them. Armor is vital for PvP and most players will die in seconds without it.Protectionis usually the ideal enchantment for armor built for combat purposes. However, it is not as specialized as some other enchantments, such asFire ProtectionandBlast Protection. These threats may prove more prominent than typical damage sources and are something to keep in mind when enchanting your armor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Shield             | Shields can be used to block incoming attacks. Upon a successful block, shields negate damage and knockback from both melee attacks and ranged attacks.Arrowsandtridentsblocked by a shield may ricochet off onto nearby blocks or entities. If hit by anaxe, the shield will be disabled for 5 seconds.‌[Java Edition  only]Shields become obsolete if they break or are fired through with a piercing Crossbow. Shields have a delay of about 0.5 seconds before they become active when used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Food               | A combatant should make sure they have a fullhungerbar during a fight. If hunger goes below18 ( × 9), their health won't regenerate, and if hunger dips below6 (), sprinting is impossible. It is recommended to eat cooked food, such assteakorcooked porkchops, as they refill more hunger points than their raw counterparts. If possible, eat agolden apple, as it grants temporaryRegenerationandAbsorption. Foods preferred for saturation once an golden apple is consumed are usually suspicious stew or golden carrots, because they provide good saturation and allow you to be unaffected by some damage in battle. This is because the rate of regeneration is much faster with a full hunger bar and saturation to spare.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Blocks             | Blocks are useful to obstruct the path of enemies or to create an escape path. They can be especially useful in tight spaces as you can block a pursuer, buying you time to escape. Blocks can also be used to pillar up walls or other heights to reach safety. Watch out for projectiles that can knock you off! There are many different types of blocks, some with unique uses, such as good blast resistance or inflammability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Potion             | Potions apply a variety of usefuleffects. These effects can strengthen allies and harm enemies when thrown assplash potions. In addition,lingering potionsallow for a larger potion radius, at of cost of it being a more expensive potion.Strength,Speed,Fire Resistance,Regeneration, andPoisonare some of the best potions to have in your arsenal. Note that drinking a regular potion takes some time and may cause you to become vulnerable. That is why splash potions are used more often by some players. However, splash potions have the disadvantage of shorter effect durations, as well as the possibility of accidentally sharing the effect with nearby opponents. To get the maximum duration of a splash potion effect, throw the potion so that it lands directly on your head. If that isn't practical at the moment, simply splash it at your feet, as forward-splashing methods don't work in recent versions. Lingering potions are useful for either making an area inaccessible for a while or allowing everyone in a team to heal together. However lingering potions often cause huge lag and are expensive, so they aren't widely used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Ender Pearl        | When thrown, it teleports the user to the location it lands. This is useful for healing, chasing, or escaping dangerous situations. Note that ender pearls inflict damage to the player on use. You can hit someone with a pearl as they are escaping, allowing you to instantly catch up to them. Some players will pearl to the side or behind the opponent's back. In some terrains like a steep cliff or the nether, one must throw it carefully or risk taking heavy fall damage. If you hit your opponent with it, they will take minor knockback.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Horse              | Horses give riders a speed advantage, which is particularly useful in a chase, an escape, or in dodging ranged attacks through strafing. Horses can also be used to reach high places through their ability to jump multiple blocks in one leap. When you get hit while on a horse you won't be knocked back and falling damage will also be reduced. Beware when around water as a horse cannot swim in water more than two blocks deep. Make sure to use horse armor and additional food to heal the horse, and maybe a lead to control the horse in obstructive terrain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Redstone           | In the right hands, redstone forms the foundation for effectivetrapsand some weapons, such asTNT cannons. Building a trap in a strategic location and luring the opponent into it can be an easy way to win a fight. However, constructing traps or weaponry in the middle of a fight is highly impractical, and thus redstone constructs are best used with the element of surprise or at the start of a fight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| End Crystal        | If used properly, end crystals can be lethal to the opponent.  To use End Crystals effectively, the attacker must protect their lower hitbox, as the upper half of a player's hitbox does not take much damage from explosions. This effect is partially done with the obsidian required to place the crystal, which protects your legs and allows you to use them in relative safety as long as your armor is good enough. On hard difficulty, a single End Crystal explosion can instantly kill a full Protection IV diamond armor player if they are within four blocks of and have their feet on the same Y-level as the crystal. On normal difficulty, a point-blank end crystal explosion can take said diamond armor player down to half a heart. However, end crystals are hard to get as they require valuable items to craft, and as a result are only used in endgame PvP and on servers with custom kits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Bed                | If you are fighting in the Nether or the End beds are a cheaper substitute to end crystals, and they are easier to place as they don't have to be placed on obsidian. Right-click on a bed in the Nether or End to explode it, leaving behind a sizeable crater and tons of fire. Try to stand on a block that is at least one block lower than where you are going to detonate the bed, or placing one block between you and the bed before exploding it, as this would protect your lower hitbox from the explosion damage, which is much more effective on the bottom half of your hitbox. If you really want to be safe, drink a fire resistance potion and have some of your armor enchanted with blast protection IV. However, beds could simply be used to suicide-bomb (or feign suicide-bombing) somebody who ambushed you, which is always better than losing your items to an enemy. With some more TNT and careful planning, one can create devastating explosions. The main disadvantage of beds is their volatile nature and the fact that they do not stack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Respawn Anchor     | Essentially the Nether variant of a bed. Although expensive, it is still much quicker and easier to place and detonate than an end crystal, and more convenient than a bed, since it can stack up to 64, meaning that it would only take up two slots in your inventory for a full stack of bombs. It's more versatile than an end crystal as it can hurt foes below it, while foes under an end crystal would be shielded from the block of obsidian or bedrock used to place the crystal on, which takes far too long to remove in a fight. The drawbacks compared to end crystals is that it has slightly less damage, and while easier to detonate singularly, it's a lot harder and slower to detonate respawn anchors safely and repeatedly and still do good damage, due to its nature of leaving craters and the fact that you have to swap to glowstone and out of it to detonate each one since it can only explode when charged with glowstone. It's also the most expensive out of the three items and are even harder to farm than end crystals. (crying obsidian is rare and the only renewable source of it, bartering, is both inconsistent and slow.) A typical endgame loadout would have both end crystals and respawn anchors/glowstone as explosive weapons, although there are exceptions. For example, if a server's difficulty is set to Easy, the explosion damage, which scales with difficulty, would no longer be sufficient enough for such weapons to be worth carrying as at that point, regular melee or bow would do similar damage without the risk of taking hefty recoil damage yourself. |
| TNT                | TNT can be used to buildtrapsor to distract and scare the opponent. With activator rails, TNT minecarts can also be used. Explosions also destroys items making it useful to render your opponents helpless if they are caught in an explosion. On some servers, notably the ones with minigames, TNT can be used as an explosive boost to launch players across a huge gap, allowing them to get to enemies on the other side and eliminating the danger of building across the void and getting knocked off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Flint and Steel    | Flint and steel can be used to distract enemies and alter the battlefield by setting surfaces onfire, forcing players to escape or avoid the area. Additionally, the flame effect incurred from being on fire obstructs a player's field of view, limiting their ability to perceive incoming threats. Be aware that the flint and steel has a low durability and won't do much harm to a skilled player.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

However, bear in mind that wolves have low health and that they are easily killed by a skilled player.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Elytra             | The elytra can be used to travel long distances at high speed, surprise attack enemies, and fly into their base. Wearing elytra drastically and dangerously reduces the user's defense due to taking up the chestplate slot. It is best to enchant your elytra with Unbreaking and have a supply of phantom membranes to repair it. Often one will use elytra with a trident to save fireworks. In a ground battle, swapping the elytra for a chestplate is highly recommended. As a method of escape, however, they are extremely powerful, especially if combined with Fireworks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Fireworks          | Fireworks can be used to boost an elytra's speed and damage enemies under a ceiling. They can also act as signals to teammates.

| Shears             | These can disarm tripwire traps without triggering them, and destroy certain blocks such as leaves and cobwebs quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Cobwebs            | Cobwebs slow any player caught in it to a crawl, which is great for making distance between you and your foe, or to trap them and make them easy targets. They can also prevent fall damage and knockback, which can be helpful in some situations, and you can intentionally stick one on your feet if your enemy is relying heavily on the latter. By jumping into it in pre-1.9 versions, a player can score multiple critical hits easily as it slows your descent while you're in it. However, it's important to know that being stuck in a cobweb while the adversary isn't gives them a lot more options than the webbed player does, such as planting lava or detonating explosives to burn or obliterate the stuck player while they skedaddle to safety. Therefore, if you often use cobwebs defensively or know your enemy uses them, it is imperative that you have a way to recover from said webs without taking hefty punishment. Bringing ender pearls allows you to escape from cobwebs quickly when needed. Water buckets also melt them away, but the time it takes for a player to use the bucket or the pearls usually means a couple of free hits for their foe. In such an instance, pearls work better than buckets as you're going to take damage while pearling anyways, and the enemy hit usually just negates said pearl damage. In the worst case scenario, you might have to break the webs with your sword.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
