## War Pigs
Loot a chest in a Bastion Remnant

Requirements: Open a never before opened chest in a bastion remnant.

Find a chest in a bastion remnant (it must be a naturally generated chest, not a player-placed one). Then simply open it. Note that any nearby piglins that can see you will attack you when you open the chest, so to safely open it, you should either find a chest with no piglins around, or block the piglins off so they can't get to you.

Additionally, for the advancement to work, the chest must have not been opened by any player before. If you play on singleplayer, this requirement doesn't affect you. If you play on multiplayer, you need to find a bastion that was not looted by anyone.

The advancement will be rewarded as soon as you open the chest.

Use a compass on a Lodestone

Requirements: Use a compass on a lodestone.

First, get a lodestone. You can either craft it or find it. Crafting a lodestone requires a netherite ingot, made from 4 netherite scraps (smelted ancient debris; see Hidden in the Depths above) and 4 gold ingots. You also need 8 chiseled stone bricks.

| Name            | Ingredients                                | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Lodestone       | Chiseled Stone Bricks+<br/>Netherite Ingot |                 |
| Netherite Ingot | Netherite Scrap+<br/>Gold Ingot            |                 |

Alternatively, you can find the lodestone. One lodestone always generates in a chest in the upper part of a "bridge" type bastion remnant.

Once you have your lodestone, you need to get a compass. It can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients                   | Crafting recipe |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| Iron Ingot+<br/>Redstone Dust |                 |

Compass can also generate in chests in ancient cities, shipwrecks, strongholds and villages (cartographer's chest). It can also be bought from librarian villagers.

Place the lodestone down and use it with the compass. The advancement is rewarded to you as soon as you do that, and the compass now points to the lodestone.

## Cover Me in Debris
Get a full suit of Netherite armor

Requirements: Have every piece of netherite armor in your inventory at the same time

You need a full set of diamond armor, four netherite ingots, a smithing table and four netherite upgrades.

Netherite ingots and diamond armor can be crafted or found in bastion remnant chests. Diamond armor can also be obtained by trading with master-level armorsmith villagers or by killing zombies and skeletons (very rare drop). It can also generate in chests in end cities and woodland mansions. 

Smithing tables can naturally generate in toolsmith houses in villages. Netherite upgrades can be found exclusively in bastion remnant chests, but guaranteed only in treasure rooms there. Alternatively, given seven diamonds and a block of netherrack, they can be duplicated in the crafting table.

| Name                                | Ingredients                                    | Crafting recipe |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Diamond Helmet                      | Diamond                                        |                 |
| Diamond Chestplate                  | Diamond                                        |                 |
| Diamond Leggings                    | Diamond                                        |                 |
| Diamond Boots                       | Diamond                                        |                 |
| Netherite Ingot                     | Netherite Scrap+<br/>Gold Ingot                |                 |
| Smithing Table                      | Iron Ingot+<br/>AnyPlanks                      |                 |
| Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template | Diamond+<br/>Netherite Upgrade+<br/>Netherrack | 2               |

Now, place down the smithing table and make a full set of netherite armor:

| Ingredients                                                                                                | Smithing recipe |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Netherite Upgrade +Diamond Boots orDiamond Helmet orDiamond Leggings orDiamond Chestplate +Netherite Ingot | Upgrade Gear    |

Once you made all of the armor and put every piece in your inventory, you will be rewarded the advancement.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 100 experience.

## Spooky Scary Skeleton
Obtain a Wither Skeleton's skull

Requirements: Have a wither skeleton skull in your inventory.

Get a wither skeleton skull. Only wither skeletons, found exclusively in nether fortresses, have a small chance of dropping one upon death, when killed by the player or by a tamed wolf. This chance is by default 2.5%, meaning that, on average, one of every 40 wither skeletons killed drops its skull. The chance can be increased if you use a sword enchanted with Looting: it increases to 3.5% chance of dropping with Looting I, to 4.5% with Looting II, and to 5.5% with Looting III. On this highest level, on average one of every 18 wither skeletons drops its skull. (For advanced players, there is a way to guarantee the drop of a skull by any wither skeleton, using a charged creeper explosion.)

Be warned that wither skeletons are very dangerous enemies, dealing high melee damage in addition to inflicting wither effect on the player. For tips on how to deal with wither skeletons and other fortress inhabitants, check out Tutorials/Defeating a Nether fortress.

Once you get the skull in your inventory, you will be rewarded the advancement.

## Into Fire
Relieve a Blaze of its rod

Requirements: Have a blaze rod in your inventory.

Acquire a blaze rod in your inventory. The only way to get it is from a blaze, another mob that spawns only in nether fortresses. Blaze by default has a 50% chance to drop a blaze rod when killed by the player or by a tamed wolf. Looting enchantment increases the amount of rods that the blaze can drop, up to 4 rods from one kill if you use a sword with Looting III.

Be warned that blazes are very dangerous enemies, dealing both melee damage and projectile damage, in addition to lighting the target on fire—which is especially deadly in the Nether, where you can't put yourself out with a water bucket! Getting at least few potions of Fire Resistance from bartering with piglins is recommended. For tips on how to deal with blazes and other fortress inhabitants, check out Tutorials/Defeating a Nether fortress.

Once you get the rod in your inventory, you will be rewarded the advancement.

## 
Charge a Respawn Anchor to the maximum

Requirements: Charge a respawn anchor with glowstone four times (to the limit).

First, craft the respawn anchor like so:

| Ingredients                    | Crafting recipe |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| Crying Obsidian+<br/>Glowstone |                 |

Additional 4 blocks of glowstone are needed to charge the anchor.

It is strongly recommended that the next part is performed in the Nether dimension. Although respawn anchors can be charged in the Overworld and the End, the moment you click on a charged respawn anchor in these dimensions, it will explode.

Place your respawn anchor and use glowstone on it four times to fully charge the respawn anchor. Once it is fully charged, you will get the advancement.
