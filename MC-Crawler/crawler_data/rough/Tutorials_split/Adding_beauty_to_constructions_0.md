# Tutorials/Adding beauty to constructions
This tutorial is to give aesthetic advice for your home or building. The beauty in exterior design can come from many different elements all interacting together. No matter what architectural style or color scheme you choose, the most important aspect of exterior design is adding details. This means that if you're building a blue colonial style home, you want to make sure to use different shades of blue blended together, maybe with another color as an accent. Try not to make your build look like a box. People may not always agree with your style, but attention to detail is undeniable.

## Basic
Note: The player can install a furniture mod to add even more realistic furniture. "Carpenter's Blocks" is also a good mod which lets you shape any block however you want.

### Floor
The oak plank flooring is one of the most common materials for a floor, given its theme and its availability. Simple and clean, it gives a homey feeling.
Under certain circumstances, a glass floor can look excellent. For example, glass works great in a see-through bridge over a ravine or river, or as a fake mirror where everything about the floor is duplicated below the floor. However, in most builds, glass is not the material to use. It's recommended that the floor should not be made out of grass or dirt blocks, as they are better suited to outdoor landscaping. It is better to use a floor made of planks or stone (including its variants such as sandstone). Smooth stone looks good as tiles, as well as polished granite, diorite, and andesite. Wool is decorative, but keep it away from fire hazards. Use concrete as a fireproof alternative. Carpet is a much better alternative to wool, due to its being cheaper. Also, you can put mycelium under carpet to make the carpet look mystical or sparkly. To add a touch of oldness to your floor, use damaged variants of the main block. For example, if the floor is made out of stone bricks, use some regular stone bricks, some cracked stone bricks, and some cobblestone/gravel as very cracked stone bricks. The more cracked the floor is, the older it'll look. Variation of blocks in your floor adds detail to it, you can also use the mossy variant of stone bricks/cobblestone. To make the floor look worn down/heavily trampled use stone and/or light gray wool. Sandstone floors can have cracks if a sandstone stair block is placed in an upside down position. For a tiled effect, try dark prismarine, which look good in environments such as kitchens, bathrooms and swimming pools. Terracotta and glazed terracotta blocks can form a satisfying, space age floor. Bone blocks can look good when placed sideways to make a smooth, white, lined floor. Wood or stripped wood floors can also look good.

### Windows

If you are in the beginning of your survival, it's a matter of preference as to whether or not you want to go focus on aesthetics or material conservation. If you choose the latter, then it's recommended not to use glass blocks, as you can use glass panes to conserve materials. If you either chose the former or are more advanced in your world, you should use glass blocks if it looks better. 

If windows are at one to two blocks above the ground, it is easy to see out of them. Make large windows that take up a section of wall for a more open feel. If you make 1Ã—2 windows, you can add wood blocks or trapdoors at the ends for shutters.

The same themed house but with a circular window instead of the above bay window. Notice how the window doesn't fit with the house design.
If you want your glass blocks to have a cloudier look, grab eight of them and one white dye and craft some white stained glass. The resulting blocks, if used correctly, can look amazing. Other colors can be used for different effects. For example, a muddy effect can be created with a brown stained glass, and blue stained glass blends in almost perfectly with water.

Again, depth is crucial to making your buildings stand out, and this also applies to windows. Bay windows, which extrude the glass out to make a mini room, and circular framed windows, which have an outer frame with the glass placed behind, are great examples.

It is highly recommended to use the circular frame, however, if it doesn't fit your build, an arch will do the same job. Several YouTubers, including Grian and MinecraftCinematics, have created videos explaining the concept of depth further. They also provide easy tutorials suitable to your theme of choice.

### Ceiling
A basic room with the mentioned ceiling detailing technique.
If your ceiling is 2 blocks high, people can't jump. Adjust it so that it measures 3 to 4 blocks high, so your home will have a more spacious feel. Remember that endermen are three blocks tall, so keep your house well lit to prevent them from spawning; note that this will not prevent endermen that have spawned elsewhere from teleporting into your home. Or you could just make a 2.5 tall room by having a slab ceiling. A top slab floor will prevent any mobs from spawning.

Appearance wise, many would suggest 4-5 blocks high as a small room, so remember that your house should have varied room ceilings. For example, a living room in a medieval house would usually reach to 5-6 blocks high, while dining halls in a medieval castle would reach up 10-12 blocks high, with the rooms reaching a mere 4-5 blocks tall. Your color palette should be used in the roof, as with the rest of your house. This means that for a house made of mainly oak and spruce planks, acacia planks for a ceiling would not fit.

To add detail, one example would be to place staircases near columns reaching to the ceiling, in order to smoothen the transition between wall and roof.
