### Pickaxes
You should bring at least a stone pickaxe, or an/a iron/diamond pickaxe if you can afford it. Diamond/Iron pickaxes can tear through netherrack fast enough to possibly not give you time to react if you hit a hidden lava stream, but a stone pickaxe can be used to break them slower instead. The Diamond/Iron pickaxe is better for breaking down the fortress, made up of much sturdier nether bricks.

For enchantments, pickaxes don't actually need many enchantments in the Nether. It's not recommended to enchant the stone one because if it breaks, you can just make a new one with your cobblestone/logs. But for the iron/diamond pickaxe, Unbreaking is useful, along with Efficiency for quickly mining through the nether fortress if you have to make a quick escape.

### Golden Apples
If you have one or more golden apples, it is recommended to bring at least one of them. These can be lifesavers in a difficult combat. If you have an enchanted golden apple, stash that back home and go back for it later. It will be useful in closing a blaze spawner, as seen below.

### Food
Your main healing item. Highly nutritious food is necessary, such as golden carrots, cooked porkchops and steak. Bringing at least half a stack of them ensures you don't run out at a critical moment.

### Cobblestone
Cobblestone is useful for many purposes, like making stone tools, staircases, blocking passages off, etc. Bring at least two stacks of it, but a third stack is good to have.

### Torches
Torches are good for navigation, marking explored areas, and extensively cutting down on mob spawns in areas you've already gone through. Try to bring three or more stacks, at least two, or bring a lot of coal or charcoal so you can craft more torches as you need them.

### 
At some point in the fortress you will want to set up a small base containing several important items and the ability to make more. When you set up a camp with these items, try to use a bit of spare logs and cobble to create another set so this place is a safe space.

### Logs
Wood is eternally useful, not just in a nether fortress but indeed throughout your Minecraft career. Bring at least 16 (32 is a good number) logs for crafting more tools and minibases and such. As of the 1.16 update you can also find wood inside the Nether. Nether wood, unlike normal wood, is fireproof, making it a good wood choice if building. Keep in mind that you can't use nether wood as fuel though, and they can't be made into charcoal.

### Fire Resistance
Fire resistance makes the player immune to fire and lava, and as such makes the player immune to blaze's ranged attacks, (but not their melee attacks.) The only source of fire resistance potions before entering the nether is witches: if they are set on fire they will begin drinking a fire resistance potion, and if they are killed before they finish there is a small chance they will drop it, making them farmable. A bow with the Flame enchantment and Power IV is a likely candidate for this. Once you enter the nether, a second source is bartering with piglins which requires large amounts of gold. Finally, you can of course brew potions, but brewing requires at least 2 blaze rods- you will have to attack a previous nether fortress before having access to this. 

Totems of undying can give you Fire Resistance. However, totems of undying are rare and can only be found by killing an evoker, a rare and powerful mob. You will also have to die for the totem to activate and give you Fire Resistance. You will likely not have Fire Resistance on your first time through, but once you get two blaze rods (see 'Brewing' below)(coming up) make Fire Resistance potions as quickly as possible.

### Shield
A shield, when used, can help with deflecting a few of the threats of nether fortress, such as mob melee attacks, blaze fireballs, and the explosions caused by ghast fireballs.  Successfully blocking a blaze fireball also prevents it from setting the player on fire (but it will not protect the player should the fireball set the ground on fire).

### Buckets
Buckets (at least two are recommended) are good for clearing up easily accessible lava. Also, if you bring a few water buckets combined with a cauldron (see below, â€Œ[Java Edition  only]), or a powder snow bucket, as they are ways of extinguishing yourself in the Nether.

### Cauldron
A cauldron allows you (in conjunction with water buckets) to extinguish yourself in the Nether by placing the cauldron and filling it with your water buckets, and then hopping in. When used, you can insert the cauldron in the ground for easier access. 

### Portal-making supplies
Especially if your nether fortress is far from your base, it is nice to have a backup way to get to the Overworld. Bring at least 10 obsidian and a flint and steel. The flint and steel is not necessarily required, since they can be found in chests or a passing blaze or ghast might help you out, but it is good to have a guaranteed portal lighting device. Also remember to have a flint and steel somewhere in the Nether in case your original portal gets blown out.

If you don't have enough obsidian to build a portal, you can obtain some through bartering with piglins.
