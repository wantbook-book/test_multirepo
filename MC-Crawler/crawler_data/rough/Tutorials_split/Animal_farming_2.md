It greatly speeds up the production of raw porkchops and cooked porkchops by utilizing a gap made by a repeater with a block above to separate the pigs and piglets.

- Construction:

1. Killing chamber:
	- If using lava on the dispenser as described below, skip this step.
2. Cooking selection:
	- This steps may be skipped if only one kind of meat is planned to use.
3. Separator:
	1. Behind the collection hopper, connect two more in a line. Use these to create a 2 deep containment pit. It is advisable to use glass on the right side to make it easier to check if the pigs have died.
	2. Remove the rear lowest wall block to extend the hopper line and place afence gate. On the outside of the block left to the gate, place a lever to control it. Behind the gate, place a repeater with a solid block above it. This creates a gap that baby pigs can pass through, but adult pigs cannot.
4. Finishing up:
	- It's possible to swap the water bucket with a lava bucket. This will produce cooked meat without using a furnace. If you only need raw meat, skip the furnace and the selector. If you want to use both kinds of meat, follow this method. Alternatively, a method similar to the Steak-a-tron 2000 may be applied to this machine.

- Preparation:

Lead your pigs via the operator stairs and gate into the slaughterhouse.

- Usage:

It is advisable to note these instructions on signs near the machine.

1. Select options: raw or cooked.
2. Open side gate, close top gate. This allows piglets to escape and be unable to re-enter the slaughterhouse.
3. Open the trapdoor and breed the pigs, then close the trapdoor, and still holding the carrots, move to the rear of the machine to attract piglets out of the slaughterhouse. Once all piglets are out, put the carrots away.
4. Return to the operator gate and look out to the left of the machine for the drowning button and press it. Wait until all pigs have died and press the button again to retract the water.
5. Close the side gate, hold your carrots again, and open the top gate to attrct piglets into the slaughterhouse again. Once all of them are in, close the trapdoor and collect your food from the chest. If using the cooked option, expect some delay while the furnace cooks all the food. If playing above 1.14, use asmokerto speed up the process.

- Modification notes:

Adult pigs cannot fall through a single trapdoor. A single water source dispenser does not drown pigs in any block more than 1 square away. It is possible to use redstone dust to relocate all controls to the front of the machine or the operator gate area if so desired. It is also possible to use an inverter circuit to ensure the top gate and side gate are always in opposite states.

### Simple one minute sheep farm
** Video **



** Function **
This machine is able to produce stacks of wool while being built in an effortless minute.

** Construction **
Collection system:

1. Find a flat patch of grass
2. Dig a 2 block long and 2 block deep hole
3. Dig out the side 4 blocks
4. On the end of the short side of the L shape, place a chest and then place a hopper running into it on the side
5. place above the chest a flicked lever
6. place powered rails within the long side of the L and then place in a minecart

These steps are illustrated below.

- Dig 2×2 hole
- Dig out the side 4 blocks

Shearing system:

1. Place above the powered rails dirt and then place on the short side of the L more dirt next to it
2. Place on the one end of the dirt an observer running out from the dirt block
3. Place in front of the observer a block and then two blocks next to it
4. Run down 5 blocks on the side and then place dispensers on top of that
5. Place redstone on top of all stone brick and dispensers
6. Create a holding cell for the sheep with slabs above the dirt blocks so that they can grow
7. Put shears into each dispensers

These steps are illustrated below.

- Place observer
- Blocks in front of observer
- Sheep holding cell

** Usage **
Make sure the dispensers are well filled with shears and the machine automatically collects wool for you. Flick the lever to turn off

** Modification notes **
You can easily expand this design to add more dispensers by lengthening it on the side. You can also breed sheep inside this farm to give more opportunities to shear wool.
