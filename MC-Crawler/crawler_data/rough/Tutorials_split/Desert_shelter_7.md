### Village Bunker
 Description 
Very safe and well suited for PvP servers or a friend's vanilla.
Easy to make and fast to make bigger this shelter basically consists of an underground base made below a village with the entrance under a villager's house.

Construction
Find a villager house and remove one block from the floor, then continue mining below you while placing ladders. When you reached the height you want to build the house start mining around (preferably in a square).
When you finished mining cover the walls with planks and you've made your house.

Extra
Try adding furnaces and chests, if you're planning to stay long then build up a farm and start strip mining.

### Desert Shelter
A 5x5 "Day 1" desert house made mostly of sand, with part-sandstone roof, in a Superflat Preset Desert.
Maybe you ended up there because you got lost, or maybe you wanted to explore. Whatever the reason, you are trapped in a desert and you are in need of shelter for when night falls.

### Day 1 Desert Shelter layout
Base square[edit | edit source]
First lay out an 11×11 square by digging a 13×13 trench, 2 blocks deep. Dig the square one deep, then go back and dig it 2 deep. 
Start by putting down a marker, then dig one block at the marker, then dig 6 blocks in each direction from the marker. That's the first edge of your square. From the ends of that first trench dig up 12 blocks from each end. Check the lengths are both 13, then join the last side of the trench.

Digging on a flat section of desert you will collect 93-94 sand digging these trenches. To complete this design you need another 22-23 sand. Getting 128 in total is not a bad number. You should also collect 12 cacti, or an absolute minimum of 4. If dirt is available, collect 16 dirt, or an absolute minimum of 12. If dirt is available you need 64 less sand, so don't worry about sand, you will have plenty just from digging the trenches.

### Lower walls and pits
Now in the center of your 11×11 square, build a 5×5 house. Start the doorway opposite your marker, 3 clear blocks distant. If you are in a hurry skip the corners (as shown). Build the walls 2 high, out of sand. The pits are one deep. They are to stop zombie children coming through your open 'windows' and 'doors'. 

The first level of the house (1 block high) is as below. Leave an open space for the two doorways. Dig small single-block pits beneath where the window openings will go. Dig semi-circular (5-block) pits around the blocks of sand that will form the lower half of the two 'doors'.

### Upper walls
The second level of the house (2 high) is as below. Place cacti on the top half of the two 'doors' (maybe later when you are closing up for the night). Leave a one-block open space for the upper part of each of the doorways and for each of the 'window' openings.
