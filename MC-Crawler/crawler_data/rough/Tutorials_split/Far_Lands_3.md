### Porting the terrain
An example of ported Far Lands terrain.
It is possible to port the Far Lands terrain from pre-Beta 1.8 into modern versions. To do that, after starting a pre-Beta 1.8 world and later reaching the Far Lands, start going (or teleporting) around to generate the Far Lands while getting rid of lag by the methods above. After generating the desired amount of terrain, convert the world into modern versions, and you will have the Far Lands terrain to do things with.

If you are using a mod, load as much terrain as you can, then convert to vanilla Minecraft of the same version.
