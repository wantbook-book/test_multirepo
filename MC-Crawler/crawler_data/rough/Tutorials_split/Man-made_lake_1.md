### Deep Pool 2
This new version is a mash up of the two techniques above. The two versions are viable, however some may find this one more simple. 

#### How To
First, dig your lake just like before. Make sure there's no hole without a water source above it directly and you're set to go.
= rows (or blocks you'll need to Destroy), = nothing (later it will be the water),  or = walls

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

This is just a plain example of what the lake should looks like from the side.


Now, add a layer of blocks (dirt is best). The purpose of this layer is to receive a pool easily filled. It doesn't need to must not be thicker than one block, you're just making your life harder if you do.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |


Notice the placement of the layer of . It is in  only to stand out from the walls. This layer must cover all of your lake.


Finally, fill the one block deep pool you're supposed to have at the top with water, make sure it's all smooth and currents-less, then destroy the layer supporting it. If all was done right, you should be done!

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |


Notice the  that have turned into , this is your layer of springs, all that is left is to eliminate the layer  under it. The lake will fill itself afterward.

Note that this schema is only an example, the size of your pool doesn't matter (except for the work you'll need to do).

## Pure Lake
So you want a lake filled with springs for whatever reasons? As always, I'm here to help. This is the best way I figured myself, if you believe you can share a better technique I invite you to do so in the discussion page.

Note; you should never apply any technique to the bottom of your lake if it's flat and full, just fill it with buckets, the self-replicating nature of the water make it easier on a flat surface.

### Bottom up
Alright, as you probably know, we can't stack water springs on top of each other—they float. They need to be placed against a solid block first.

First step is, as always, dig your hole the way you want your lake. As always, make sure it's perfect and ready to receive water. Next, fill the bottom of this hole with water, this should be the easy part.

Now the harder part, which really is only time taking. Make a grid above your first level of water. It must surround one big square made of at most 4 squares of planned water.

Illustration of what your grid should looks like.

When your grid is perfect, you can start filling up. Start by placing water on the inside of the square (where the  is on the schema above). When you're done with that part, replace every block in your grid by a spring of water. There's no particular way to do it that is best, but you must make sure to never, ever, isolate a block. You always want every block to be relied to another block so that you can put a springs in its place. If you goof, refer to the "there are current" section. 

Now, to finish your lake you just need to recreate the grid at every layer until you reach the desired size for your pool.

Note, I said "at most" because, if you make a 3×3 square, one block will be out of reach for you to place a water spring. The shape of the grid can be modified to fit the shape of your pool if it's not a square, however, make sure you have a block to place a spring everywhere you need it.
