# Tutorials/Monster spawner traps
Monster spawner traps are a type of mob farm that uses a monster spawner. They employ the monster spawners found in dungeons as a source of mobs. The purpose of these traps is to create an infinite source of items that can be gathered in an efficient way from the mobs spawned by the monster spawner. Two general goals of these traps are to keep the player safe and to allow the mobs to spawn.

## Finding dungeons
Dungeons are found when tunneling or exploring caves and mineshafts. They appear to spawn in random places, but almost always underground, usually at the Y=30 to Y=60 range. Finding dungeons without mods, cheats, or external programs is mostly attributed to luck and some know-how. While exploring, some tricks can be used to help detect dungeons. Gravity blocks like sand and gravel in a neat square may cover a monster spawner and is easily visible in deserts if spawned near the surface. Hearing or seeing a group of single-type mobs while caving could mean a monster spawner is nearby. Lastly, mossy cobblestone or normal cobblestone naturally spawning away from lava, is a dungeon, unless it is in a jungle biome, where it can also be a jungle temple.

Monster spawners can be neutralized by placing torches to light up any dark areas around the monster spawner. With the exception of blaze monster spawners, a single torch placed on the monster spawner is sufficient to disable it. Because blazes can spawn up to light level 11, multiple torches (light level 14) are required to neutralize a blaze monster spawner. There are six different mobs that can spawn. They are separated into two categories: the two-block high tall mobs (zombies, skeletons, and blazes) and the one block high short mobs (spiders, cave spiders, and silverfish). Similar variants such as the zombie villager are not included in this list.

In the Nether, blaze monster spawners can be generated in nether fortresses, and can be trapped to collect blaze rods and mass amounts of experience. Blaze monster spawners are the most dangerous to trap because of the height of the structure and the additional danger of lava. One must be well-prepared to contain this type of monster spawner, lest they might die from heights, lava, the blazes, or even external mobs.

Silverfish monster spawners can be found in the portal room of a stronghold. However, silverfish don't drop anything and are bothersome unless properly trapped. You may choose to simply break the monster spawner, unless you want to create a silverfish trap near an entrance to your base. Silverfish have some advantages: they are the easiest hostile mob to kill.

Normal spider monster spawners are one of the easiest to trap, as they cannot fit through a 1 wide hole, so you can dig through the side and place a torch on the monster spawner without fear of getting hurt.

Cave spider monster spawners are hard to trap since you will get poisoned on normal or higher difficulty, novice and intermediate players may be better off breaking or disabling these as soon as possible. These monster spawners are generated more often than other types, and some may even generate within 20 blocks of one another, which can be leveraged into an efficient farm. Because cave spiders can fit through 1×1 spaces and between slabs, it is possible to make small, simple, and efficient grinders, although the difficulty in containing cave spiders can lead to spiders leaking out and/or poisoning the players.

Zombie monster spawners are also a bit tricky, as the monster spawner may spawn baby zombies, which are a 1×1 mob, making proper containment essential, (particularly on harder difficulties). The zombies may spawn other zombies nearby to "help", making area security a priority, and the monster spawner may also spawn zombie villagers which makes adding in some manner of player-controlled sorting mechanism a consideration. On that note, however, zombie monster spawners can prove to be one of the most lucrative to trap, as the variety of items it can drop is extensive, and potentially limitless if you factor in the added option to use it to generate Villagers, which can then, in turn, be traded with, themselves "farmed", or used to make iron golem farms.

## Simple farms
The three most common types of monster spawner are for zombies, skeletons, and spiders. In each case, it's fairly trivial to set them up so that you can attack the monsters without retaliation, forming a simple farm for XP and their drops. Sometimes cave spider monster spawners can be treated similarly, but this is more hazardous. Proceed as follows:

1. Secure and light the area around the dungeon. Light the room and monster spawner while you work on it, so the monsters don't interrupt you.
2. Ransack and clear out the chests. Choose and prepare a "front" area for the farm, with a chest and crafting table to supply swords. Make sure you have a clear approach and/or room to back away quickly, in case you come by and find one or more creepers spawned inside, and you need to shoot them. The details of the front will vary according to what monsters you are farming (see below).
3. Prepare the monster spawner area by digging out the entire spawning range. That's a 9×9×4 area centered on the monster spawner. So you'll dig two layers of the floor underneath, two blocks above the monster spawner, along with walls to five blocks out horizontally. In order to maximize spawn rates, however, in case it's not a spider monster spawner, it is advisable to dig a further 5 blocks under the monster spawner, dropping any non-spider mobs outside of the monster spawner's detection range. Fill in the walls surrounding the farm, except at the front. Close off any extra exits and alcoves, fill stray holes, place fences as needed.
4. Set up any redstone machinery, including access tunnels and alcoves.
5. Prepare the front according to the monster type (see below). You will always want fence gates, in case you want to dash in between spawns to collect drops, or to fix something up.
6. Most farms will want a flood system, to wash monsters and stray drops toward the front. If you've opened up the full 10×10 area under the monster spawner, you can get a nice sheet of water from three water source blocks at the back. This will push monsters forward and bring all drops within reach of the front. If you still have items being stuck in one corner, you might resort to a side tunnel and/or a sticky piston to get at them without exposing yourself.
7. Once your farm is prepared, remove most or all of the lights. Beat a hasty retreat to the front.
8. Make some swords and whack away. Keep bows and arrows (or tridents with the Loyalty enchantment) handy near the entrance, in case a creeper spawns while you're away or approaching, or otherwise sneaks into the area (normal darkness spawns are suppressed within 24 blocks of a player).

A bit of a special case: if you found a dungeon on mushroom fields or mushroom field shore biomes, congratulations! Proceed as usual, but without worry about creepers or other stray monsters intruding, making it easier to make a farm without little distraction from mobs.
