- LodestoneA place where players can adjust theircompasseswith alodestoneso they can easily find their way back to the city if they leave. The lodestone can be free to use, or you can have a usage fee.

Remember, you cannot make any mines if you play on superflat, unless you customize it in certain ways. A good way to mine is to branch-mine. It's efficient, safe and useful. It is recommended in extreme hills because of the emeralds available. It might be a good idea to build this near a surface smelter or refinery.

How to start a branch mine:
1. Dig a 3×3 staircase (Not going straight down).
2. Figure out what level you want to miners to dig at.
3. Dig a 3×3 tunnel connected to the end of your staircase, it can be off any side(s).
