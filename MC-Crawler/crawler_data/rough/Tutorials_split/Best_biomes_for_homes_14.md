#### Pros
- Nether fossil structures generate frequently here, allowing for the harvesting of a large quantity of bone blocks for building or bone/bonemeal related purposed.
- Soul sand and soul soil are abundant, meaning it is a good place to gather them for nether wart farming or soul fire-related blocks.
- Basalt also generates in this biome in stalactite formations.

#### Cons
- Skeletons and ghasts spawn here in droves. This combined with soul sand to slow the player down, it can be dangerous to live in this biome.
- There is no food to be found in this biome. The player must bring food from another biome.

#### Useful resources
Bone blocks, soul sand, soul soil, basalt, bones, arrows, ghast tears, gunpowder are useful resources found in soul sand valleys. 

### Basalt deltas
Basalt deltas are a unique biome in the Nether, as netherrack rarely generates within it (aside from structures). Instead, basalt and blackstone make up most of the terrain. Small lava pools are dotted around the biome, and magma cubes spawn much more commonly here than elsewhere, with the rare ghast being the only other naturally spawning mob.

#### Pros
- Blackstone, a necessary block for making furnaces and stone tools, is in abundance here.
- Basalt makes for a unique building block.
- An abundance of magma cubes means plenty ofmagma creamto be gathered, which can be used in brewing to make fire resistance potions. Considering the fire and lava immunity this potion gives, it can be worthwhile to brew these potions considering the Nether's general terrain.
- Ores generate at double the rate here than in any other biome, and they can be easy to spot due to using a netherrack based texture contrasting against the basalt/blackstone.

#### Cons
- This biome is uneven, has many sharp cliffs, and contains common pools of lava and magma blocks, making flattening the terrain to construct buildings difficult.
- The frequent lava pools are a constant threat, and the jagged terrain can make them hard to spot beyond ridges or in small holes.
- There is no food to be found in this biome. The player must bring food from another biome.
- Magma cubes, while slow, are a dangerous mob due to their large hitbox to deal damage with when they leap onto the player, as well as their ability to split into smaller and weaker, but numerous, duplicates upon death.

#### Useful resources
Basalt, blackstone and magma creams are useful resources found in basalt deltas.

## The End
This dimension would not be advisable for beginner players, but for players who want an advanced challenge, the End could serve as a home after the final boss is defeated. The End dimension is made up of two different areas: the center island where the final boss is fought; and the outer islands that begin generating 1000 blocks from the center. The center island is a somewhat small landmass that is made up of end stone, obsidian and bedrock. The outer islands feature many end stone islands, chorus plants, and valuable end cities. Should the player chose to live solely in this biome without important items from the Overworld (as if they had spawned into the world for the first time), the center island is uninhabitable on its own merits; it offers no food or resources to collect. The outer islands must be reached in order to obtain the necessary resources. Note that the player must kill the final boss before the challenge begins, as it can kill an item-less player in a few seconds.

### Central island
This is the location the player first encounters when entering the End, and is the location of the ender dragon boss. For long-term survival, the Ender Dragon must be defeated, as the boss destroys any blocks other than end stone, obsidian or indestructible blocks like bedrock.

#### Pros
- Plenty ofender pearls. Ender pearls could be easily farmed.
- The island is a large, flat, open space, meaning there is plenty of room for building. Although, the obsidian pillars would be a nightmare to remove if desired, as their size and the mining time of obsidian would make the project tedious.
- The sole portal back to the Overworld is located here, as well as all the portals to the outer islands created by killing ender dragons.
- This is also the place where the player consistently spawns within the End from the Overworld, so making the area safe is recommended.

#### Cons
- There is no food to be found on the center island. Chorus fruits generate only on the outer islands. The player must bring food from another biome/dimension.
- If theender dragonwere to be re-summoned, it would likely cause severe damage to any structures the player had built.

#### Useful resources
End stone, obsidian, the exit portal, end gateway portals, the dragon egg and ender pearls are useful resources found on the central island.

### Outer islands
The outer islands of the End are more sustainable than the central island, but they are still a harrowing challenge. The biome consists of large end stone islands that are usually separated by gaps dozens of blocks wide. Ender pearls or bridges can be used to cross these gaps, but be wary of angering endermen, as they can teleport onto the bridge and easily knock the player off. 

#### Pros
- Plenty ofender pearls. Ender pearls could be easily farmed.
- Plenty of chorus plants can be collected, which, while serving as a sufficient food source, randomly teleport the player when eaten.
- Anend citycan provide some of the tools the player had been lacking, including enchanted iron/diamond tools and armor. The most valuable loot is theelytra, found on the flying ships in an end city. This item can make traversing the vast chasms between islands much easier. Also, the cities can be renovated or deconstructed for their unique building blocks, some of the only ones the player can obtain.
- Given that both chests andshulker shellscan be obtained in end cities, the player can createshulker boxesfor mobile storage needs.
