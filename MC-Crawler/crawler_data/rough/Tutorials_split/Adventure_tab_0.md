## Adventure
Adventure, exploration, and combat

Requirements: Kill a mob, or get killed by a mob or player.

You can try to find animals to kill (e.g. cows), or wait until nighttime or enter a cave to kill a hostile mob (e.g. zombie). The other, less wanted alternative is to die from a hostile mob at nighttime or in caves. Overall, no special attention is needed to get this advancement.

## Voluntary Exile
Kill a raid captain. Maybe consider staying away from villages for the time being...

Requirements: Kill an illager captain, either from an illager patrol or a pillager outpost.

There are three ways of getting this advancement. You could just wait for an illager patrol to happen and find the raid captain: it is a pillager with an ominous banner on its head. Killing it will grant the advancement. Note that illager patrols are somewhat uncommon, and they can get really rare if you play on a large multiplayer server.

Alternatively, you can find a pillager outpost and wait for a raid captain to spawn in. Once you kill it, you will get the same result. This method is more reliable on larger servers.

If you dealt finishing blow to the captain yourself (in other words, it didn't die from fall damage, fire etc.) you will get the Bad Omen effect. This will cause a raid to start if you enter a village in the next 100 minutes. If that is not what you want, make sure to drink a bucket of milk as soon as you get the advancement. If you don't have milk with you, find the nearest cow, mooshroom or goat, and milk it.

Finally, if you play on multiplayer and you join a raid that someone else started, you can get this advancement by killing either a pillager, evoker or vindicator in one of the waves that is wearing the ominous banner.

This is a hidden advancement, meaning that it can only be viewed when the player has completed the advancement.

Look at a parrot through a spyglass

Requirements: Use a spyglass while aiming at a parrot.

First, craft a spyglass:

| Ingredients                      | Crafting recipe |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Amethyst Shard+<br/>Copper Ingot |                 |

Then, locate a parrot, which are only found in jungle and bamboo jungle biomes. Use the spyglass and look through it at the parrot. Once you do that, you will be granted the advancement.

Note that killing wardens, despite them being hostile monsters, can't trigger this advancement.

You can use any type of item or your bare hands to kill the monster, but it is recommended to have a weapon (like a bow, sword or axe) to decrease your chances of being killed yourself. It is also recommended to earn this advancement on a common, easy-to-kill monster, like a zombie or spider.

## The Power of Books
Read the powered signal of a Chiseled Bookshelf using a Comparator

Requirements: Place a chiseled bookshelf and a redstone comparator next to it.

You need a chiseled bookshelf and a redstone comparator:

| Name                | Ingredients                                  | Crafting recipe |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Chiseled Bookshelf  | AnyPlanks+<br/>AnyWooden Slab                |                 |
| Redstone Comparator | Redstone Torch+<br/>Nether Quartz+<br/>Stone |                 |

Place the bookshelf down, and a comparator on any side of it. Placing comparator first and bookshelf second works as well. Note that comparator must be pointing away from the bookshelf (that is, the white triangle on top of it should be pointing away) as this enables the comparator to read a signal from the bookshelf. Once you placed the second block, you will get the advancement.
