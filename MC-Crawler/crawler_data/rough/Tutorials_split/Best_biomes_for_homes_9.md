#### Cons
- Limited space for building due to the massive amount of bamboo.
- Extremely thick vegetation makes it difficult to navigate.
- Cannot obtain pufferfish or tropical fish when fishing.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
- Lacks jungle pyramids.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
- A large amount of bamboo can lead to a frozen computer.
- Clearing multiple stalks of bamboo with a sword for a large building project can cause lag.

#### Useful resources
Jungle wood, vines, podzol, loot from jungle pyramids, parrots, ocelots, bamboo, pandas, melons are useful resources found in bamboo jungles.

#### Multiplayer
Bamboo jungles are not recommended for many reasons. One, they have far less wood than normal jungles. Two, they can be laggy even if you have a good device. And three, they are quite difficult to navigate and to build defenses in. Even the bamboo itself has little practical use other than making scaffoldings, sticks, and as a poor fuel source.

### Stony shore
The stony shore biome occurs where a biome meets the ocean. Stony shore, is a beach biome variant, and, true to its name, is completely made of stone, sometimes with andesite, diorite or granite as well.

#### Pros
- Sometimes in stony shore biomes, both mountains biomes and oceans are usually visible, which makes great scenery.
- Stony shores are completely made up of stone, making it great for aboveground stone mining.
- Unlike in mountains biomes, water is easily obtainable from the ocean next to stone shore biomes.
- Similar to windswept hills, stony shores contain a lot of coal.
- Buried treasure can generate at high elevations here, so digging below sea level is not always required to find them.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

#### Cons
- No passive mobs can spawn in thisbiome, meaning that the player must to go to another biome to getporkchops,beef,chicken,raw mutton, orrabbit.
- There are notreesat all in a stone shorebiome, although some dirt patches may generate.

#### Useful resources
Water, snow, ice, buried treasure, stone and coal ore are useful resources found in stone shores.

#### Tips
- Building underground can circumvent the issue of no level ground for building.
- Animals can be brought from other biomes and kept here in farms for food.

### Dark forest
This is the only place that dark oak trees can naturally spawn. These thick trees allow players to chop a single tree down for more than half a stack of wood, plus saplings and rarely apples. Also, dark forests occasionally spawn woodland mansions when sufficiently far away from the world spawn point. However, in addition to all of the problems with living in a regular forest, the area underneath the trees is often dark enough for monsters to spawn even in daytime, making this biome rather dangerous, especially for beginners.

#### Pros
- Lots of wood: a single tree can yield between half a stack and over a stack of dark oak wood.
- Huge mushrooms naturally spawn among the trees, giving the player a renewable food source.
- The canopy of the forest is safe as mobs do not spawn on the leaf blocks. The player can navigate and travel over the forest quickly as there are little to no obstructions.
- Woodland mansionscan spawn here, which can provide shelter and valuable loot from the mobs inside. The mansion can be turned into a base once cleared and looted and is generally easy to find after doing so because of how large and easy to notice a mansion is from far away.

#### Cons
- Navigation can be difficult.
- Leaves block out most of the sunlight, allowing undead mobs to be active throughout the day. It is usually dark enough on the forest floor to spawn even more monsters at night.
- Trees may hinder construction, and are more time-consuming to chop down.
- Woodland mansions are the only placesvindicatorsandevokersnaturally spawn outside ofraids. These are some of the most dangerous mobs in the game, with vindicators being able to sprint and hittingextremelyhard and evokers summoningvexes, which can travel through blocks and are hard to hit.
	- Consult theTutorials/Defeating a woodland mansionarticle for more information about clearing out the mansion.

#### Useful resources
Dark oak wood, mushrooms, and totems of undying (found when you kill a evoker found in a woodland mansion and raids) are useful resources found in dark forests.

#### Tips
- Travel on top of the forest canopy. This allows for unobstructed vision and movement, as mobs do not spawn on leaf blocks.
- Light up frequently used ground to avoid being ambushed by mobs in the daytime.

### Snowy taiga
The snowy taiga is a snowy, cold biome, which can be considered the snowy variant of the spruce forest. Wolves and foxes spawn here, which can aid the player when tamed. Snow falls instead of rain, and water eventually turns to ice if exposed to the sun, which disallows sugar cane or infinite water sources outdoors unless near a light source. Snow on top of your shelter can be annoying, and the few leaves on spruce trees can mean fewer saplings.

#### Pros
- Spruce wood is plentiful here.
- Ice farms and snow farms can be built here and do not need to be built higher than y-95, unlike the mountains.
- Wolvesandfoxescan be found and tamed here.
- Igloosspawn, which give a brewing stand, golden apple and some Potions ofWeakness.
- Berry bushes sometimes generate here.
- Villagescan generate here‌[Bedrock Edition  only].
	- The buildings are identical to those in a taiga.
- Pillager outposts can generate here.
- Snow golemsare easy to mass-produce because of the abundant snow and pumpkins from villages.

#### Cons
- Farming is inconvenient because water freezes into ice if not protected from freezing bylightsources like torches.
- It snows uncontrollably, and can form patches of unwanted snow.
	- Additionally, snow can stack on buildings‌[Bedrock Edition  only].
- It is rather hard to find sheep here because wolves kill them.
- Undead mobs can hide under trees and survive during the daytime.
- Pillager outposts can generate here.
