### Creeper
The first released texture of the creeper. The old leaf texture is overlaying a lighter version of the pig test texture with some green added. Areas for arms and long legs are seen, which were never used.

- Creeper texture from 0.24_SURVIVAL_TEST.

### Textures hidden in transparency

  

It has been suggested that  this section be split into its own page. [discuss]
If this split may potentially be controversial, do not split until a consensus has been reached. Reason: not really an easter egg, more like unintended leftovers; as there are many of these a separate page would make more sense



  

This section is missing information about other non-entity textures, as item textures seem to have a lot of unused translucent regions as stitched_items.png reveals. 
Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page.


Some of the textures have pixels set to 0 opacity, which makes them appear transparent when viewed with most image viewers. However, the color information of these pixels is still present and can be retrieved by disabling the alpha channel. Most of these textures are probably leftovers from the creation of the texture, that the editing program didn't erase but instead simply set the opacity to 0.
Textures listed here had their alpha channel disabled to reveal unused/hidden pixels in the texture. Most of the invisible pixels are from development of the texture or already existing texture has been used as a template during development.

#### 1.12.2
##### Entities
- Arrow texture was used as a template for the leash knot.
- All shield textures have hidden banner texture.
- Chainmail armor was used as a template for stray's robe.
- Bell appears to have some extra faces.

##### Mobs
There are hidden pixels in these mobs. As of 1.19.2, all except the ocelot still have them.

##### Alex
- 
- 
- 

In version 1.8, Alex was added to the game. Invisible pixels include Alex's face with glasses, a reference to Jeb, a Mojang developer, as well as an unfinished arm texture similar to Steve's used texture.

##### Silverfish
- 

The silverfish was added in Beta 1.8, but the texture already exists in Beta 1.7. Invisible pixels consist of a few different colored regions around the "hair" textures.

##### Endermite
- 

The snapshot texture of the endermite is seen underneath the new one.

##### Bat
- 

An unused face texture can be seen and the spider head texture is seen under the wing. The spider texture was used as a template for the bat.

##### Ocelot and cat

  

This section is missing information about Bedrock Edition exclusive gray cat texture.

- Pre 1.14

- New cat variants

- 

The ocelot and the cat variants were added in version 1.2.1. The ocelot's hidden pixels contain an extra head texture, and all the cat textures feature an orange texture with black lines across it. After the 1.14 update, the ocelot texture no longer contains hidden pixels. Most of the new cat textures are edited from the old ones, as indicated by the similar hidden patterns. The textures also appear to have been cropped, since a large part of the old hidden texture is missing, with the exception of the red cat texture, which appears to be unchanged.

##### Wolf
- 
- 
- 
- 

The wolf was added in Java Edition Beta 1.4. All four wolf texture files feature similar hidden textures base on the cow, which suggests that the cow was used as a template for wolf textures. The most extreme is the collar texture, which originally contains only the collar, but there is an entire wolf and other unused textures hidden in transparency.

##### Blaze
- 

The blaze has a hidden body texture.

##### Magma cube
- 

 A second pair of eyes are visible.

##### Wither
- 
- 
- 

The wither's armor texture was based on creeper's charged armor. In the wither textures, there is a copy of the main head under the smaller one. The light blue color is visible without removing transparency.

##### Guardians
- 
- 
- 

It seems that a template texture was used for designing the guardians.

##### Vex
- 
- 

The vex head is bigger and there seems to be leftover wing design.

##### Zombies
- 
- 

The zombie textures have a villager zombie head hidden in its texture.

### Capes
Main article: Cape
Some cape textures have a secret on the underside where it is not very visible.

- The Translator cape has a big pink T on its underside.
- The Chinese Translator cape has a small pixelated Chinese flag on its underside.
- cheapsh0t's cape has a small pixelated Japanese flag on its underside.
- The Prismarine cape has a prismarine block texture on its underside.
- The Scrolls Champion cape has a big yellow S on its underside.
- The Turtle cape has a turtle's belly on its underside.
- The Birthday cape has a big yellow star on its underside, similar to that of the Millionth Customer cape.

## Languages
