## Core rooms
There are several things that are useful to include in your house in Minecraft. 

### Foyer
Most houses should have a main room with an entrance from the outside. You may wish to include a bed, a furnace, and a crafting table in this room. It would be convenient to connect all hallways or separate rooms to this room. 

Some tools, weapons, armor, and/or food stored in a chest can be useful, as then you can gather up some essential supplies quickly when coming to your home for a quick resupply.

### Crafting room
See also: Crafting

This room is helpful to the player when crafting items. A crafting room may include a crafting table, at least one furnace, and a sufficient number of chests containing common crafting materials found while mining or exploring, such as wood, cobblestone, and iron, as well as any other materials that may be useful while crafting, such as sticks or wood planks. Labeling the chests help to organize your belongings. There should be quick access to the storage room from here. Wood would be a nice material to use as it suits the theme.

### Smelting room
See also: Smelting

This room is important if you are a big miner and/or adventurer as you can smelt large numbers of ores quickly. Make a large room and line the walls with furnaces, possibly keeping a chest of fuel such as coal or wood planks inside as well (A bucket of lava is good too. It can smelt 100 items and also is a good source of light.). The benefit of having multiple furnaces is a faster overall smelting time, since each furnace is able to run independently. Having each furnace full of said fuel is also helpful. This room could easily be merged with the Crafting Room, and it may be most convenient to do so. Also, bear in mind that you can use hoppers if you wish to automate your smelting operations.

### Storage room
A room full of chests for storing all of the dirt, cobblestone and other less-valuable materials that accumulates in your inventory while mining. You can also make a lava 'bin' to dispose of your unwanted items; this can be done by simply digging a hole (don't use wood etc. near it: the lava ignites flammable blocks) and filling it with lava. You may also build another store room, with a guarded and hidden entrance though this store room is usually filled with more valuable and rare materials, i.e. gold, iron, diamonds, emeralds, etc. Perhaps you even want to include a trapped room with trapped chests and TNT, if you are in PVP.

### Entrance to your mine
It's generally a good idea to put the entrance to your mine inside your shelter, simply so that if you return at night you won't encounter mobs. It's probably a good idea to make sure your mine is well lit by torches, redstone lamps, or glowstone. If playing in a mode besides peaceful, you should put a door so mobs do not get in (use iron doors when on hard: zombies on that difficulty can damage wooden doors to the point of breaking). Buttons are useful for any barrier only opened by redstone.

### Bedroom
Sleeping in a bed resets your spawn point to that bed. It's a pretty good idea to have this in a secure bunker. It's also a good idea to keep this room far from the outdoors, so a mob cannot prevent you from sleeping or blow up your bed. For added safety against creepers creeping up on you or PVP griefers in your sleep, use three-layered walls, with the middle one being obsidian or water.

### Brewery
Once you've been to the Nether and gathered some blaze rods, you can create a Brewery, which is simply a room with a brewing stand and a cauldron (however an infinite water source works just the same and doesn't run out). It is great to be able to brew some potions to prepare yourself for leaving your base. Include a chest with some potion ingredients such as sugar, redstone, blaze powder, nether wart, glowstone dust, spider eyes, magma cream, fermented spider eyes, glass bottles and a well as it is an unlimited water supply.

Positive Effect Potions and an example of a brewery can be found, at the brewing page.

### Enchanting room
See also: Enchanting

After gathering some diamonds, obsidian, sugar cane, and leather (to make a book),you can build an enchantment table. This lets you enchant your items (See Enchanting for help on design), and since bookshelves give you higher level enchantments, this room could also be a good use for your sugar cane. It's also a good idea to keep this room close to your mob grinder for easily regaining your xp and to keep a chest with books in this room to enchant them and, of course, store enchanted books.

### Farm
You need a source of food readily accessible from your shelter. Wheat seeds are the easiest food to get, so start with them. Later, you can plant other crops, like potatoes and carrots. The aforementioned crops can also be used to breed certain passive mobs for more effective food. You can also grow pumpkins, which are obtained from dungeon chests and/or found in the wilderness (Usually taigas, extreme hills, and forests). Melons seeds found in dungeon chests aren't a good source of food, but can be good for potions, via glistering melons. Beetroot seeds are also a choice, although you need to find a village or visit the End or get beetroot seeds which are obtained from dungeon chests first. 

Later in game, you may also want to build farms for other plants, such as sugarcane, cactus or chorus fruit, or even flowers and short grass (details explained in the Expansions section).

### 
Eventually, you may use up all the trees in your immediate surroundings, so you should replant them with saplings. Keep it well lit, both to keep away mobs and speed up the growth of trees. Birch is recommended, because it grows fastest, but oak and jungle trees are also a good choice, due to their apples and immense size respectively. It is difficult to build an indoor or underground tree farm that can supply your wood needs, unless you use bone meal or keep it well lit. Create a room that is bigger than trees.
