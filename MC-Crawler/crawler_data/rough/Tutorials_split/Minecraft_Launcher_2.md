## Command line usage



Important Note 
On Windows, this works only on the old Unified Minecraft Launcher and NOT the Microsoft Store version.



  

This section is missing information about the default host of the proxy (if available) and the --nativeLauncherVersion flag. 
Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page.



The Minecraft Launcher can be invoked using the command line by typing %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Minecraft Launcher\MinecraftLauncher.exe in Windows, minecraft-launcher in Linux or /Applications/Minecraft.app/Contents/MacOS/launcher in Mac.
The Help Message when using MinecraftLauncher.exe --help
As of version 2.2.25xx, the Minecraft Launcher has these command-line options available for Minecraft: Java Edition:

- --demo- This launches the demo version of the game, much like if the game hasn't been purchased yet.
- -h, --help- This option displays a help message on how to run it in the command line.
- --clean– This option deletes the "game" and "runtime" folders, including their contents, from the working directory.
- --launcherui- This option presents the login screen.
- -w, --workDir– This option, followed by a path (relative or absolute), changes the location (and/or name) of the.minecraftfolder.
	- Can be used to create a portable installation of the game. For example,--workDir(or--workDir=.) can be used to make theMinecraft Launcheruse the current directory (no matter what the current folder is called).
- --nativeLauncherVersion- .
- --tmpDir– This option, followed by a path (relative or absolute), changes the location (and/or name) of thetmpfolder.
- -l, --lockDir- This option, followed by a path, restricts the installation directory to a specified folder.
- --winTen– This option adds support for Windows 10. Since theMinecraft Launchernow supports Windows 10 fully, this option is unnecessary and seems to have no effect.
- --proxyHost- This option changes where the host of the proxy is.
- --proxyPort- This option changes the default port from80to a custom one.
- --disableGPU- This disables GPU acceleration in theMinecraft Launcher, which might fix issues when playing minecraft.
- --debugGPU- This opens up a new window showing debug information, like "Graphic Feature Stats", which shows if Hardware acceleration is enabled on certain features, and an option to copy the content to the clipboard. These might be useful for troubleshooting purposes.


## Uninstalling the old Minecraft Unified Launcher
Source: "Uninstalling the Old Minecraft Unified Launcher" – Minecraft Help Center.

This applies only to players using Windows 10 or newer. Older versions of Windows are not able to use the new Minecraft Launcher for Windows. With the addition of a new launcher, you can uninstall the old launcher to remove any confusion between the two. For clarity, the new launcher is referred to as the "Minecraft Launcher for Windows" and the old launcher as the "Minecraft Unified Launcher". 

How to uninstall the Minecraft Unified Launcher (old launcher):

1. Click the start menu in Windows (windows icon in the bottom left).
2. Type in "Add or remove programs" and click the top entry.
3. Search for "Minecraft Launcher". The launcher to uninstall displaysMojangunderneath the title "Minecraft Launcher".
4. Click the three dots shown to the left of the "Minecraft Launcher" title and select "Uninstall".

Now only one launcher should be installed. Run the Minecraft Launcher for Windows to ensure it still works; if it doesn't, reinstall using Microsoft Store.

Launcher or game mods may need to be migrated or re-installed to the new Minecraft Launcher for Windows installation location before uninstalling the old launcher. Check with the mod developer for more detail.
