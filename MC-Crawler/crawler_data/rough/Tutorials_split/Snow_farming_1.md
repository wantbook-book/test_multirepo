### Build
A minimal snow farm.
For most snow farms, the player constructs a snow golem, trapped in a 1Ã—1 space. The golem should be standing on a block that can support snow layers and isn't quickly destroyed by shovels, and where the player can easily target that block. Here is a step-by-step guide for how to make a snow farm using snow golems:

1. Place the floor block, where the golem will stand. Typically this is one level above where the player will stand, i.e. the player can and must jump to be able to stand on the block.
2. Place the two snow blocks, one on top of the other, on top of the floor block.
3. Place blocks around the upper snow block to keep the golem from leaving the farm. Full blocks will likely work better than fences, as they constrain the golem's movement to a smaller area.
4. Place the pumpkin on top of the upper snow block, which will spawn the golem in place of the snow blocks.
5. If the golem is in a position where it might be exposed torain, place a block above it to prevent this.

Here are some suggestions of ways to enhance your snow farm: 

- Includehoppersto collect snowballs and feed them into chests when the player's inventory is full
- Add aminecart with hopperunder the floor block for the same purpose
- Make a mechanism to dispense extrashovelsinto the player's hand, as existing shovels break.
- Make the area around the snow golem larger, so that more snow can be produced, and the golem won't be confined so much.

### Operation
To operate the snow farm, simply stand next to the golem's floor block, equip a shovel, aim at the snow layer on top of that block without hitting the golem itself, and hold the dig control.

Note that the durability on the shovel will go down very quickly: a new stone shovel without the Unbreaking enchantment will break in about 13 seconds after producing 131 snowballs (enough to make 32 snow blocks with 3 snowballs leftover), and an iron shovel will break in about 25 seconds after producing 250 snowballs (enough to make 62 snow blocks with 2 snowballs left over). Unless you have an iron golem farm or plenty of iron, it is recommended to use a stone shovel, because stone shovels dig up snow at the same speed as gold, iron, and diamond, and cobblestone is extremely common and renewable. However, using stone shovels means that they have less durability, so make sure to bring plenty.

Also, remember to enable the mobGriefing gamerule; otherwise, the golem will be unable to create snow.
