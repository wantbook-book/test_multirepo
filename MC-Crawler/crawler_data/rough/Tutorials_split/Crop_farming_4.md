Follow the layout, which is the maximum area for a single villager with a composter[1]. You can use waterlogged leaves (since 1.19) to prevent water from flowing out the outside wallsâ€Œ[Java Edition  only]. Or use a stair and a trapdoor. Build a roof on top of the farm to prevent lightning strikes from converting villagers into witches.

The next layer can be built such that there are 2 air blocks between the farmland on each layer. The walls can be any (even solid) block. The layout can be tiled by placing 4 farms in a diamond shape around the collection area.

### Adding a collection system and villagers
Hopper collection system for the farm
The collection system is made with a hopper and 2 minecart with hoppers stacked on top, as well as a top trapdoor to prevent the villagers from walking through the minecarts.

Build a collection chamber either in the center of the tiled layout, or at any flat edge of the farm. To place the minecarts with hoppers on top of each other, simply place a block with a rail and minecart with hopper above the bottom minecart and break the block. The minecarts will stack. Don't forget to place a trapdoor on top of the minecarts to prevent villagers from walking through them.

Add one villager to the farmland part of the farm and lock their profession to farmer by trading once with them. And another villager to the collection area of the farm. It is helpful to lock the collection-villager to a non-farmer profession to prevent it from taking the farmer's composter as it's job block.

The easiest way to add villagers to the farm is to add workstations inside the areas where they should be (the composter is already in the farmland part, so place any job block in the walls of the collection chamber) and then letting the villagers to pathfind to the job blocks. Once the villagers are inside close off their areas and optionally remove the extra job block.
