### City
The city has a lot of resources. It is because it is normally the "capital" of a region. The ways to show this is by building vertically through offices and skyscrapers made of materials such as terracotta and glass. It is basically an "upgraded" version of a town, and is usually larger. Cities are main hubs for everything. It becomes the attraction and therefore it must offer services most places do not give. To support the inhabitants, it must have at least 30 houses and 5 different commercial services. Otherwise, have at least one of the following: a large religious building, industrial center, or university. In a city like this, you could imagine a scenario where the inhabitants and visitors come to work, on trips, holiday, or to party. They usually have homes in a suburb some distance away. This means you will need a neat collective transit system and well-established roads.

Instead of continuing to group and centralize the services in a town, the society has probably come to a point where the city itself gets so urbanized, that it needs some arrangement. Perhaps make zones to include residential, commercial, industrial places, etc. respectively. More details about this is in the tutorial for Building a Metropolis. Cities are well known throughout the entire continent, and have connections with towns. Capital Cities also contain Government Buildings and maybe even a palace.

These are important characteristics of a city provided in this guide

- Downtown, bigger and higher structures, different streets and road standards
- Capital status: government institutions and departments
- Transit system across districts—dedicated train stations, signs, etc.
- Services (education institutions, hospital have their own property)
	- Residential, commercial and industrial areas are put into separate districts
- More attractions than a Town could offer—a nice, green park, swimming hall, sports hall, concert halls, bars, etc.

## Other types of Settlement
Hamlet

Smaller than a village. A hamlet is simply a small group of houses with little or no commercial services. It may not even be named!

Borough

A very large town that doesn't have official city status. It must have at least 30 houses and can have some city characteristics, as well as be part of a larger city, but doesn't meet the requirements to become a city itself.

Conurbation

Many towns and cities merged into a one really large urban area. Just build at least two or three different towns and/or cities close enough to each other to be seen as one.

Metropolis

A massive city with plenty of skyscrapers and high-rise buildings. Usually a combination of boroughs.

Challenge yourself by thinking socioeconomically; how do the resources available (cobblestone, wood, farms, etc.) appear visually on your settlement? You don't have to assess this beforehand. At least, for a visitor, it creates the illusion of a genuine place to be at. This comes naturally in Survival mode, but in creative, it may be a relevant question. Do you build your settlement out of stone, when there is no quarries, mountains, or access to a shaft nearby?

## Naming Your Settlement
You can name your settlement before or after you have begun. 

One of the easiest cues to names are the associations to the place. Town's and city's names derive from nature, region, other's name or a mix of these. Many places have same suffixes (word added at the end). You can use names from cartoons or video games.

Examples:

- River in the plains—"Flat River Village/Town/City"
- Jungle Mountain—"Monkhill Village/Town/City"
- Forest—"Bush Village/Town/City"
- Swamp—"Wet Village/Town/City"

You can name your place after it has taken shape so it looks thematically correct. Like if your place use a lot of stone material and have sharp roofs, it may be called "Rocky Point Village/City/Town". Ask yourself; why are the Rocky Mountains in North America called Rocky Mountains?  

If else, look for names of real towns and cities (possibly around your area in real life) or dig through this fantasy name generator. The fantasy name generator has an enormous name database, having 500 generators for names you could not imagine. Navigate to "place names".

### Using Suffixes
You can use them to mix and match suffixes and prefixes. Here is a list of some suffixes you can fit on the end of the settlement's name with all examples being names of real places in Great Britain.

-ton (e.g. Northampton)
-town (e.g. Newtown)
-don (e.g. London)
-dale (e.g. Rochdale)
-ville (e.g. Bourneville)
-chester (e.g. Manchester)
-field (e.g. Sheffield)
-gate (e.g. Ramsgate)
-burg(h) (e.g. Edinburgh)
-borough (e.g. Scarborough)
-market (e.g. Newmarket)
-port (e.g. Southport)
-head (e.g. Birkenhead)
-bridge (e.g. Cambridge)
-mouth (e.g. Portsmouth)
-ham (e.g. Nottingham)
-ford (e.g. Oxford)
-church (e.g. Whitchurch)
-bury (e.g. Shrewsbury)
-bourne (e.g. Eastbourne)
-wood (e.g. Brentwood)
-wich (e.g. Norwich)
-sea (e.g. Swansea)
