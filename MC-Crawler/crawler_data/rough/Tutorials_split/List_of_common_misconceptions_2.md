## Development
Myth: The game playable on classic.minecraft.net, named Minecraft Classic, was the first version of Minecraft: Java Edition. 

- This is not the first ever version ofMinecraft: Java Edition, nor was it ever a part of any of its development phases. Rather, it is aJavaScript recreationof the real Classic version0.0.23a_01to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the game's initial release. Further inspection reveals it to bea flawed recreation. The reason a JavaScript recreation was used instead of the real thing is likely due to Java applets no longer being supported by most browsers.
- The first known version ofMinecraft: Java Editionis actuallyJava Edition pre-Classic rd-131655(Cave game tech demo)

Myth: Java Edition 1.0.0 was the first release of Minecraft.

- Java Edition 1.0.0is not the first ever release ofMinecraft. It was the first "official" release ofJava Editionin its final development phase which has persisted to the current day, however it is preceded by two and a half years' worth of prior development across six other development phases.
	- Also, despite the launcher calling it "1.0", the version number is "1.0.0" with two zeros.

Myth: Herobrine was actually added to the game.

- Herobrinewas never in the game. Nothing even close to Herobrine was ever added to Minecraft.

Myth: Minecraft is a ripoff of Infiniminer.

- Although Notch liftedMinecraft's voxel-based worlds, and potentially the concept of mining, directly fromInfiniminer, little else of Infiniminer's gameplay and style was reused inMinecraft, asInfiniminerwas a much more limited and simplistic type of game, which stopped being updated beforeMinecraftwas even released.

Myth: The Minecraft Launcher has every version of Minecraft.

- While theMinecraft Launcherhas many versions available to play, it is far from having every version. There are dozens of versions archived that are not in theMinecraft Launcher. In fact, some of the versions in theMinecraft Launcherwere modified, rather than being the original copies as they were on release.
- Some versions are lost (no copy is available) to this day.

## Technical
Myth: Direct item forms of blocks (ItemBlocks of technical blocks) are completely nonexistent In Java Edition. 

- If a block exists, its item form exists in active or inactive way. ItemBlocks (BlockItems) of technical blocks are justhiddenandinactivated, and can be activated byregisteringthem manually via simple modding but rendering the correct item icons of these items requires more extensive modding + resource packs.

## Miscellaneous
Myth: Minecraft is named after mining and crafting, two essential elements of the game.

- This is a false etymology. The name "Minecraft" first appeared in thepre-Classicdevelopment phase on May 15, 2009, and crafting as a mechanic was not added to the game until theIndevdevelopment phase on January 28, 2010.
	- Therefore, the game couldn't have been named after its crafting mechanic. It's more likely to have been named afterwikipedia:Warcraft, or had "craft" as a suffix added in a similar manner.

Myth: Steve had a beard all the way through alpha, but it was removed sometime in beta.

- Steve's classic beard was removed inClassic 0.24. As such, Steve was beardless all through-out Indev, Infdev, and Alpha.
	- Steve's beard was often misinterpreted as a smile, which was perhaps why it was removed from the skin, even though it continued to be used in marketing.
	- Steve's beard was not re-added untilJava Edition 1.19.3andBedrock Edition 1.19.50.

Myth: Minecraft 4k was created to be less than 4 kilobytes in size.

- WhileMinecraft 4kis less than 4 kilobytes in size (being only 2581 bytes), the game jam for which it was designed required games to be less than 4kibibytes(4096 bytes) in size.

Myth: The terms "feature" and "update" are interchangeable, hence popular videos titled along the lines of "n Updates in Minecraft 1.xx".

- An update refers to a (typically new) version, not a feature. Changes to existing features can be referred to as updates to that feature. However, calling newly implemented features "updates" is incorrect.

## Other media
Myth: The naturalist of the Minecraft: Mobestiary is a reliable narrator.

- The Minecraft: Mobestiary was officially confirmed by the author to be an unreliable source, as the book was written from the perspective of an in-universe naturalist who heavily speculated about the subject matter that he wrote about.
