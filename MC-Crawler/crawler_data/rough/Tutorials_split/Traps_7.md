### Netherite block live-capture trap
This trap is extremely expensive to construct.

This trap is intended to work on players, and requires a secondary trap to initiate.

1. Locate a location in the overworld at bedrock level in which a 1×1×2 hole exists. If a player were to jump into said hole, they should see a block of bedrock directly in front of their face on all four sides.
2. Dig a vertical, 1×1 shaft all the way to the surface and construct a secondary trap there. The secondary trap must be able to force the target into the 1×1 shaft.
3. Approximately 10-15 blocks above bedrock, place a pair of tripwire hooks and string so that mobs that fall down the 1×1 shaft will trigger the tripwire.
4. Wire the Tripwire setup down to bedrock level by any means necessary, but ideally with as little delay as possible.
5. Place a Block of Netherite on top of one of the four bedrock blocks surrounding the hole.
6. Place a second Block of Netherite on top of another one of the four bedrock blocks surrounding the hole, but not directly across from the Block of Netherite placed in Step 5.
7. Place a piston adjacent to and facing toward the Block of Netherite placed in Step 5. The piston must face toward the hole.
8. Place a piston adjacent to and facing toward the Block of Netherite placed in Step 6. The piston must face toward the hole.
9. Place a disposable block opposite to the Block of Netherite placed in Step 5.
10. Place a piston adjacent to and facing toward the disposable block placed in Step 9. The piston must face toward the hole.
11. Remove the disposable block placed in Step 9.
12. Using redstone dust and redstone repeaters, separate the redstone line coming from the Tripwire placed in Step 3 into two repeaters. Set one to 1 tick, the other to 4 ticks.
13. Wire the redstone line from the 1-tick repeater directly into the piston placed in Step 8.
14. Wire the redstone line from the 4-tick repeater into a pulse shortener to reduce it to a 1-tick signal.
15. Construct a basic repeater clock, composed of 2 1-tick repeaters wired into each other.
16. Wire the pulse shortener to the repeater clock.
17. Wire one end of the repeater clock to the piston placed in Step 7.
18. Wire the other end of the repeater clock to the piston placed in Step 10.
19. Place a Cobweb on the bottom of the hole to prevent the target from dying to fall damage.

Should the trap be triggered, the following sequence of events will occur:

- Target springs secondary trap and is forced into 1×1 shaft.
- Target triggers tripwire while falling down shaft.
- Target hits cobweb at bottom.
- Piston placed in Step 8 triggers, pushing Block of Netherite directly above hole.
- Repeater clock triggered, causing pistons placed in Steps 7 and 10 to repeatedly shift the Blocks of Netherite back and forth, preventing them from being dug out. Blocks of Netherite are shifted at an interval of time that is shorter than the amount of time needed to break a Block of Netherite by conventional means such as by pickaxe.
- Target is contained within the trap until trap is disabled or target dies (or remains trapped indefinetly if difficulty settings forbid death by hunger and target has no other means of commiting suicide (Ender pearls, Potions etc.)).

## Piston traps
These traps use pistons to harm the target.

### Crushing trap





















A piston suffocation trap
This is ideal at the end of a water flow mob grinder as it minimizes drop losses. The design can be expanded to make a long row.


### Honeycomb trap






























A simple honeycomb trap. Replace the wool with a honeycomb block.
Connect two sticky pistons to a clock circuit so that they rapidly push a honeycomb block back and forth. If done correctly a player fallen into this trap will be unable to get out. Honeycomb block was chosen because tools do not affect the breaking speed, even with enchantments. Alternatively, a Block of Netherite could be used instead, as while Pickaxes break it faster, it still takes so long to break that even an Efficiency V Netherite Pickaxe cannot break it in time before it gets moved.

### Cake trap
1. Dig down two blocks in a flat area and put apistonat the bottom.
2. Dig down two blocks around the piston and putredstone dustat the bottom.
3. Dig down two blocks around the redstone and put pistons at the bottom.
4. Cover everything up with the block(s) of your choice.
5. Placepressure platesin a ring around the center block, above the redstone.
6. Put acakeon top of the center piston.
7. Above the outer ring of pistons, place blocks in the air so there is room to walk under if the pistons are retracted.

If the target moves too near to the cake, the pistons will trap them and destroy the cake.

### Pitfall trap
This device uses pistons to push entities into a pit.

## Manual traps
These traps require the player to manually trigger the trap, or perhaps even be the trap.

### Grave digging
Ask someone if they could dig down at a spot, perhaps because you lost diamonds there. When they get far enough, cover them with sand or gravel. You can also use lava for a more dramatic death, however, this will destroy their drops as well and won't work if they have a source of Fire Resistance. This will probably only work on inexperienced players.
