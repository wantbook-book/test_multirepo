### Advanced Global Progression
After you have defeated the ender dragon and gotten shulker boxes, you have completed the basic global progression, but there are still many things you can do in a nomadic world.

#### Storage
Your most important step is to expand your storage. The ender chest has 27 slots and pairing it with 27 shulker boxes can give you 729 slots, which is enough to store 729-46656 items (depending on stack size). Even though this is a lot, it is still limited. You will need to get as many donkeys and/or llamas as you can and get leads. To get the leads, kill some wandering traders. Equip the trader llamas with chests and check their storage. If it is less than 12 slots, kill it and try again with another llama. If you want a donkey, you can find it in plains biomes. Equip it with a chest. It is guaranteed to have 15 slots. If you put shulker boxes in the animals, you can store much more items. Just make sure your lead doesn't break and you lose all your diamonds. Put valuables in the ender chest's shulker boxes, and put bulk materials, like dirt and cobblestone, in the animals. If you have name tags, name the animals so you can tell which one carries which, such as naming them, "Mob Drops", "Bulk Materials", "Potions". It is also a good idea to dye the shulker boxes and name them with the anvil.

#### Nomadic moving base
This base is built in a flying machine and moves. This base follows all the basic rules and can move in two directions. It contains 12 minecart chests for storage, 4 villager storage, and crafting tables. In order to move in other directions, the base has to be taken down and reoriented.

All pistons are sticky in Java Edition. For Bedrock Edition the pistons facing right are not. The ones facing left are.
The machine moves right.

#### Resource production
Since you cannot build farms, you have to manually produce resources. You cannot farm crops and trees without using bone meal because you don't have time for them to grow. In order to get bone meal, compost extra seeds or kill skeletons for bones. If you see the wandering trader, buy as much items as you can because you don't have time to farm those items and the wandering trader makes those items renewable. To get honey, you have to bring a silk touch pickaxe to get a bee nest and place it during the day and wait for the bees to produce honey. You should get an average of one honey bottle a day, so you have to go through many days to build the nomadic flying base. If you find more bee nests, silk touch them. If you got honeycombs, you can also craft beehives and breed bees, but you have to pick them up at night because you cannot move them with pistons. If you need resources from the nether, you need to set up the nether portal and return to that portal before the 20 minutes passes, or you have to build a new portal and lose your base. If you need to go to the end, set your spawn point in your base and use eyes of ender to find the nearest stronghold and find the end portal. If you go through the return portal, you will end back at your base, which doesn't count returning back to previous locations because the end exit portal will always take you to your spawn point. The flying machine will allow you to bring villagers, although you have to break the minecarts during the day to let the villagers work. You must not place blocks on the flying machine, except the ones already in the blueprint, or the machine will break. To get villagers, you have to be quick to get them from a nearby village before the 20 minutes passes. Use a staircase or elevator to move them up and place them in minecarts and place workstations. If you want animals, you will need to expand the flying machine to allow animals. The base is built out of honey blocks, so the animals won't move around too much. You can still breed them and kill them for their drops. You can bring as many villagers as you want for your nomadic base, as long as you have enough space for them. You can also add more minecart with chest for storage. These are the basics of this tutorial. However, there are many other things you can do besides building, in a nomadic world.

Challenges:

- Expand your base and add more villagers and animals.
- Explore generated structures like temples.
- Gather every single block and item.
- Take on a village raid.
- Max out all your villagers' trades.
- Defeat a woodland mansion.
- Conquer a bastion remnant.
- Raid an ocean monument for sponges and prismarine.
- Complete all the advancements.
- Use Fundy's custom difficulties, such as Impossible, Impossible++, Nightmare, and Cursed. These will add challenges to your nomadic world.
- Try Ultra-Hardcore or Half Heart Hardcore. You must not take risks!
- Make a diamond or netherite beacon.
- Try nomadic experience in SuperFlat, Caves, Floating Biomes, or Single Biome (preferably a challenging biome like desert or ice spikes).
- Try nomadic experience starting in the nether or the end outer islands.

## Nomadic shelters
Nomadic shelters can range anywhere from absolute simplicity to an easily deployable craft station. In principle, Nomadic shelters should be easy to make and accessible from almost anywhere on the various maps of Minecraft. Below is a list of Shelters that are organized by complexity. The most basic utility for the nomad is the bed. It's easy to make: only 3 blocks of wool and 3 blocks of wooden planks are needed to craft it.
