If you are using Buffet world generation rather than superflat world generation, a river biome may appear along internal borders between two Desert biomes [needs testing in 1.14]. If this has a low bank, it may allow grass and/or flowers to spawn (as the grass is still in the “River” biome). The grass blocks can be 'grown' by adding adjacent dirt blocks, and the growth of flowers and tall grass can be boosted with bone meal. 

Rarely there may be a wide enough space here for an oak tree to spawn. In that case, be sure to create a tree farm from any saplings you collect from it. As trees are almost essential for normal survival, this would be useful. Once you have trees, almost all of the special difficulties of the desert biome go away (apart from Husks).

There is also the possibility of sugar cane and, less commonly, pumpkin spawning. In combination with seeds for breeding chickens, from grass, this means it's theoretically possible that a river biome can create sustainable food in the form of pumpkin pie. Pumpkin can also be bought from wandering traders, and sold to farmers for emeralds. Saplings can also be bought, providing an alternative to the river method above, although they cost 5 emeralds each. Moss blocks can be bought for 1 emerald for two blocks, although it takes a lot of bonemeal to get azaleas (and therefore wood) from them. However, because it is rare to find emeralds, make sure you think twice.

## Finding a village or other structure
In practical terms, the best way to make progress in a Desert survival situation is to find a Village. Other structures, such as desert wells, pillager outposts, desert temples, mineshafts and strongholds, are either less useful (wells) or much more challenging (all the others).

After creating your infinite desert, once you have secured a survival shelter, explore the immediate area around—being careful of course not to lose the way back to your shelter. As with any Minecraft game, it helps to build a high pillar near your spawn point and/or initial shelter, so you can find your way back to it. Climb the nearby high peaks in the morning, and scan the horizon at midday. If you see a desert temple or a village, build a temporary shelter at the point you spotted it and go to the village or temple the next day. Make sure you return to your shelter before dusk and that you are not in or near the village at night. Otherwise, the village may suffer irreplaceable damage to mob attacks caused by your presence.

If you don't find anything, get back to your main base and explore in a different direction. If you have explored in all directions one day's travel from your main base, you must start using small shelters as way-stations to increase your search radius.

### Exploiting a village
The most important items you can retrieve from a village are the crafting table and tools—most importantly an iron pickaxe if you are lucky—from the weaponsmith or toolsmith chest. You can also find iron ingots and diamond in these chests, or even use gold ingots (also found in village temple chests) to make tools, most likely a gold pickaxe that you would use only to obtain enough cobblestone to make a stone pickaxe. 

Iron, diamonds, and emeralds can be taken from villages and temples (for tools and trading). Dirt can be taken from villagers' farms, but best only do this if you have a hoe. Ores do spawn in deserts (even in the Superflat Desert preset, but in that case only on the bottom 3 layers, or next to lava ponds). However, without a pickaxe, you are not only unable to collect ore, but also unable to build a furnace to smelt any ores (or cook any food). The furnaces in a village blacksmith are therefore extremely useful.

Actually, the best possible item you could find in a village would be some kind of sapling. Oak saplings can be found in weaponsmith chests sometimes. If you find a sapling, start a sapling farm. Make sure you are never so greedy for wood that you forget to farm leaves for more saplings than you cut down. Once you find a sapling (or actual tree), most of your problems are basically over. You have renewable wood. Wood means tools, weapons, fuel, charcoal, light sources. Wood means pickaxes, which means cobblestone, which means stone tools then iron tools then diamond tools. With one sapling or tree, you are back to playing a normal game of Minecraft—just in the desert.

### Exploiting a desert temple
Desert temples (unlike village temples) are guarded by hostile mobs. You need to be confident in evading, trapping, or killing mobs (or a combination of these) in an offensive style, before tackling a desert temple. 

Removing the resources from the lower part of the temple may require building a spiral staircase down, around the inner walls, probably using sandstone blocks. The easiest way, however, is to dig straight down one wall near a corner, then pillar-jump back up after you have looted basement. Do not step in the center until you have mined the central pressure plate, lest you die in the explosion.

### Exploiting desert wells
Because you don't need to drink in Minecraft, wells are of little use until you can craft a Bucket.

### Exploiting other structures
Other structures (apart from wells) are more challenging than a temple from a mob point of view and are best left until you are in a much stronger position.

### Using locate commands
If commands are enabled, you can use commands if you couldn't find any: /locate structure temple and /locate structure village, although you are playing on Survival mode, as otherwise there really isn't much point in a 'desert survival' challenge, in which case cheats are not enabled. However, if you are really stuck, you could copy your game world, recreate it as Creative, and use the /locate commands above or just fly around to locate the nearest village.
