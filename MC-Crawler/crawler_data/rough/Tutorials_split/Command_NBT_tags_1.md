| CanPlaceOn     | This tag is used when making adventure maps to determine which block(s) the player can place a block on. Also used on hoes to make them till dirt and on spawn eggs to place them.  If the value is not a valid block or item it displays as "`missingno`". | An array of strings, each one of which is a command argument of typeblock_predicate. However, to use NBT tags, the NBT data of the block must be synchronized to the client (campfires and player heads are two of the blocks that do so). | `{CanPlaceOn:["minecraft:stone","#minecraft:logs","minecraft:player_head[rotation=8]{SkullOwner:{Name:'Dinnerbone'}}"]}` |

| TileEntityData      | Used to store all data kept within a block. Mainly used within blocks that can store items or contain various data values, e.g., Command blocks, Chests, Jukeboxes, Dispenser, Beacon, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | CustomName, Items, Command, Levels, Primary, Secondary, Delay, MaxNearbyEntities, MaxSpawnDelay, MinSpawnDelay, RequiredPlayerRange, SpawnCount, SpawnRange, EntityID                                                                     | None                                                                                              | `{TileEntityData:{Entity NBT data here}}`                                                                                                            |
| Motion              | Determines theinitialvelocity of most entities (all other than Dragon Fireballs, Fireballs, Small Fireballs and Wither Skulls) upon being summoned. Must be entered as double precision floating point values (decimals). Example: {Motion:[0.0,1.0,0.0]} summons with an initial upward velocity of 1.0. The values could be only -10 to 10, because it could have been to be moved very fast. It normally could lead to a wall clip. | n/a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | All                                                                                               | `{Motion:[DOUBLE,DOUBLE,DOUBLE]}`                                                                                                                    |
| direction           | Similar to Motion, determines theinitialvelocity of Dragon Fireballs, Fireballs, Small Fireballs, and Wither Skulls upon being summoned. This tag isrequiredto summon said entities, otherwise the command fails. Example: {direction:[0.0,1.0,0.0]} summons with an initial upward velocity of 1.0.This tag determines only the entity's velocity, not the direction that it's facing.                                                | n/a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | All                                                                                               | `{direction:[DOUBLE,DOUBLE,DOUBLE]}`                                                                                                                 |
| power               | Similar to direction, but determines constant acceleration. Example: {power:[0.0,1.0,0.0]} gives the summoned entity a constant upward acceleration of 1.0.  Entities are still affected by drag when power is nonzero and eventually reaches a terminal velocity. Affects only Dragon Fireballs, Fireballs, Small Fireballs, and Wither Skulls.                                                                                       | n/a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | All                                                                                               | `{power:[DOUBLE,DOUBLE,DOUBLE]}`                                                                                                                     |
