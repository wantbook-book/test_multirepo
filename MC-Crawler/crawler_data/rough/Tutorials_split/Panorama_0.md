### 
The unreleased menu screen panorama that came before the final version.
Dinnerbone had stated that the menu panorama was originally going to be an in-game render of a live world, with custom world generation with the seed 100. He also mentioned another panorama that came before the one seen in Beta 1.8, which was a plains biome near the beach.[2]


### Classical panorama
The original menu panorama in-game. (Coordinates: X≈61.48, Y=75, Z≈-68.73)
| Java Edition(pre-Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4) | Java Edition | Bedrock Edition |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
|                                         |              |                 |

This panorama had been introduced to Java Edition in Beta 1.8's early development and used for over six years before its replacement in the 1.13 prerelease stage.

The panorama used in Java and Bedrock editions were same. When this panorama was first introduced in Bedrock Edition, it had used the version which fixed the white line inside of it.

This panorama had been taken on the seed 2151901553968352745 or 8091867987493326313 (both are considered valid seeds) at coordinates X=61.48, Y=75, Z=-68.73. This seed 2151901553968352745 spawns the player in a plains biome at -156, 244 from (Beta 1.9 Pre-release 4 to 1.12.2 and Pocket 1.0.0 to Pocket 1.1.0). The panorama distance direction is 380 blocks SW. These seeds work in versions from Alpha v1.2.0 to Beta 1.7.3 (except for population differences).[3] The actual version that was used to generate this panorama must have been a development version from Beta 1.6.6 to Beta 1.7, based on the file dates. Dinnerbone noted that the panorama was taken by Notch while he was travelling, around June 1–15, 2011.[4][5]

In Java Edition, this panorama is used for versions from Beta 1.8 Pre-release to 18w22c.

In Bedrock Edition, this panorama is used for versions from v0.7.3 alpha to 1.1.7 and had a blur applied.

In Minecraft Education, it was used from its initial release to 1.0.1. 

Usage in other editions is unknown.

The panoramas used in Java and Bedrock editions are different. It's also the first time the panorama changed in Java Edition, six and a half years since the original.

This panorama for Java Edition had been taken on the seed 18w22a (numeric: 1458140401) at coordinates X=1553.76, Y=58.62, Z=-1162.79. This seed spawns the player in a plains Biome at 236, -212, distance direction is 1625 blocks SW in the warm ocean biome. This seed generates most correctly in version 18w22a.[7]

In Java Edition, this panorama is used for versions from 1.13-pre1 to 1.13.2. Before the panorama was changed to reflect the Village & Pillage, it was also used for versions from 18w43a to 18w47b.

This panorama in Bedrock Edition beta 1.14.0.1 is different from Java Edition. It is taken from the same seed at the same coordinates but with the initial view in a different direction. The same vegetation appears, but with different clouds.

In beta 1.14.0.2, this panorama had been changed to be similar to the panorama in Java Edition, with the only difference being the clouds. panorama_5.png is the same with the file in Java Edition. The modified version is used for beta 1.14.0.2 to beta 1.16.0.55.
