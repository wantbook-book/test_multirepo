## Types of shelters to consider
An example of a large shelter.
- A mountain hideout
- A floating house
- A small dirt shack (good for the first night)
- Small one or two story house
- Large 2 or 3 story house
- A hill fort
- A treehouse
- An underground shelter
- A small fort
- A larger fort or castle (a collection of buildings, sometimes arranged around a courtyard. Usually with defenses)
- A walled off area (even if there is no ceiling, it still lets you sleep if closed off)
- A large castle (about 40×40×23)
- A mansion (Bigger than 30×30×10)
- A cabin
- A dugout (when making it, you gain and don't use blocks, unless you run into an opening that you want to block off)
- An underwater base (not a good first shelter)

Generally you want to start basic, don't over-exert yourself on the first day!

Get creative! Build a dock, or a town. It is fine to have useless buildings only for their looks. A collection of small builds can make something far greater than one, big building.

## Shelters for the first night
Here are some options for a shelter on your first night that can be built with limited resources. 

### Hole in the wall
A hiding hole.
While you were gathering cobblestone and coal on your first day, you most likely dug a small hole in the side of a surface cave, or staircase down through the dirt. In either case, you can use that hole as a shelter. Dig a few more blocks into the hill or cave wall, then you can dig a small room (8×8×3 is the most recommended. It's not too small, but not too big.) Relocate your crafting table and furnace in here, and make sure to light it up!

You can place a door across the entrance to your shelter to protect you from mobs, while still giving you access. It is generally recommended to place it from the outside (go outside your shelter and place it while looking inside.)

If you don't have wood to spare for a door, simply cover your entrance with dirt or cobblestone when night falls, periodically breaking it to check for daytime (watch out for mobs though!)
