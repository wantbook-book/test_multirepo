## Dusk
If you decide to start making a mine, there are many methods to dig for resources. While a safe method would be simply to dig a large room, lighting it up as you dig while looking for ores, a more profitable (and risky) decision would be to look for a cave and start spelunking. If you decide to find and explore caves, a sword, food, enough wood (20 to 30 logs) and a light source (presumably torches) are absolute necessities. If you come across any ore other than coal, or iron, get an iron pickaxe before you mine it, as using an inferior pickaxe not only takes longer to mine it, it breaks the ore without dropping the resource. You need ladders and a crafting table, just in case you find a good cave and decide to stay underground for long. 

If you run short on food, you can survive on rotten flesh dropped by zombies, but it is not as nutritious and can poison you with hunger for 30 seconds. If you are living on rotten flesh, it is best to wait until the hunger bar is low and then eat multiple rotten flesh in quick succession, because the hunger penalty doesn't stack (If you do get hunger penalty, stay still to prevent hunger loss). 

Be prepared for hostile mobs, as it is a common but fatal mistake for starters to think that the moon spawns hostile mobs, and not simply darkness. If you come back with enough iron, you can experience many more features of Minecraft, mainly redstone, pistons, diamond, and much more. You have started on your path to your success in Minecraft, whether you have found iron or not.

## Other options
One good idea is to chop an extra log and burn it for charcoal. With practice, you can start a new game and as long as you are near trees when you spawn, you should be able to make basic tools, a furnace and have enough wood for torches before midday (5:00).

Often people would rather use up wooden tools before switching to your newly made stone tools, but the stone tools really are better â€” if you don't want to "waste" the wooden tools, you can use them as fuel to smelt single items, or keep them as a trophy for late-game!

If possible, and if you can spot a position where you would like to build a house when you spawn, try to gather the resources from nearby, and only dig where you would otherwise dig to construct your house to save time later. Replant all saplings (which have a chance of falling when tree leaves are mined) as soon as they fall if this is the case so that you have less distance to walk later.

If you are more adventurous, find an ocean. As soon as you have a lot of wood blocks, build the crafting table and wooden axe as above, then build 3 or 4 boats and go sailing. Spend nights at sea while perusing the coastline for a nice place to make your base. Once you do, put ashore at dawn and proceed with the guidelines above.
