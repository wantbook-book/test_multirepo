### Taiga
The taiga is the colder version of the forest. In taiga biomes, only the spruce tree can be found, which is good for spruce-related buildings.

#### Pros
- Wolvesspawn here and can be tamed.
- Rabbitscan spawn here.
- Villagescan generate here.
	- Village fletchers have chests that can be looted.
	- Pumpkinsgenerate abundantly in taiga villages.
	- Outdoor armories havearmor standsequipped with iron armor.
- Only spruce trees are available, giving taigas a less obstructed view of the sky than forests.
- Sweet berry bushesgenerate here, an abundant source of food.
- Foxesspawn here, and trusted foxes can defend the player.

#### Cons
- Although rabbits, sheep, and foxes can spawn here, they can be killed by wolves; chickens and rabbits are also targeted by foxes.
- Hostile mobs can hide under trees in the daytime.
- Pillager outpostscan generate here.
- Spruce trees require slightly more effort to remove due to their varying heights.

#### Useful resources
Wolves, villages and villagers, ferns, wood, rabbits, pumpkins and lanterns (from villages), sweet berry bushes, foxes, pillager outposts are useful resources found in taiga biomes.

#### Tips
- Villages in the taiga often have strange layouts, so keep in mind there may be distant houses if trying to protect a village.
- You can give trusting foxes weapons, and the fox deals increased damage as well as any enchantments on the weapon. This is useful for large fights.

#### Multiplayer
The taiga is a wonderful all-round biome. The trees provide cover but are not as dense as forests or dark forests, and berries provide a source of food. Villages here generate a lot of pumpkins, and wolves spawn in this biome too. Pillager outposts provide a challenge or can be used as a natural defense for a skybase or underground base. Foxes can also be tamed, adding to the benefits of the biome. This biome is not particularly special or "cool", but is a good all-rounder, and is one of the best choices for a beginner to multiplayer.

### Swamp
The swamp biome offers flat space (although much of it is flooded), plenty of trees, water, and clay. Swamp huts generate here, and slimes spawn aboveground. Frogs can be found hopping around eating these slimes, and make for cute pets. Mushrooms and huge mushrooms‌[Bedrock Edition  only] are fairly common, making mushroom stew a good early-game food. Lily pads are common on the water. Fossils spawn 15-24 blocks underground. Blue orchids are exclusive to swamps. 

#### Pros
- The land is flat, making building here easier.
- Slimes, which dropslimeballsupon death. Slimeballs are used to craftsticky pistonsandslime blocks, making this biome useful for redstone-knowledgeable players.
- Blue orchidsspawn only in this biome, besides woodland mansions.
- Swamp huts spawnwitchescontinuously. This allows for witch farming, allowing one to farmredstone,sugar,gunpowder,glowstone,glass bottles,spider eyesand, in some cases, pre-brewedpotions.
	- Cauldrons may contain potions in place of water. ‌[Bedrock Edition  only].
	- Black cats spawn in swamp huts.
	- The hut can also be used as a base once it is adequately lit up.
- Frogscan be a unique pet, and they eat any small slimes nearby. Should the player feed them a smallmagma cube, they drop afroglightcorresponding to the frog's color.
- Fire does not spread far in this biome due to the large areas of water and spread-out trees.
- It is a good place for fishing because of all its water.
- Fossilshave a 1 in 64 chance per chunk to spawn underground and can be a good source ofbone meal.
- Huge mushrooms generate here. ‌[Bedrock Edition  only].
- Zombie villagers spawn here wearing unique clothes and can be cured into swamp villagers.
- Using clay disks, the player can find diamonds.

#### Cons
- Extremely flooded. It is hard to attempt to build anything large without reforming the landscape, though building a stilt house may be a solution.
- Depending on equipment and skill level, the extra slimes may be overwhelming.
- Witches can become a problem when near a swamp hut.
- No villages generate here.
- Bringing pets or mobs through the water on leads may lead to them being stuck under a lily pad and drown.
- Water is discolored and not as appealing as water elsewhere.
	- Zombies may end up underwater and sink, turning into drowned. This makes nights in this biome noticeably more dangerous.

#### Useful resources
Clay, oak wood, sugar canes, vines, mushrooms, slimeballs, lily pads, blue orchids, witches and their drops, fossils and tridents are useful resources found in swamp biomes.

#### Tips
- Bridges can be built with lily pads.
- TheDepth Striderenchantment is helpful for traveling in water.
- Beware of drowned; underwater visibility is lower in swamp water.
- A boat can easily harvest lily pads; beware of drowned following you and entering your boat.
- By adding ablue orchidto themushroom stewrecipe, you can craftsuspicious stewinstead, which is more than twice as nourishing and fully restores yoursaturationmeter.

#### Multiplayer
Swamps are good enough by themselves in a multiplayer setting, but are outclassed by taigas and savannas. They provide trees and food (mushrooms), but also boast many dangers on top of enemy players (slimes, drowned and witches). However, bases in swamps are hard to attack without boats and/or lily pads. Aside from this, farming is easy in swamps due to fossils being a good source of bone meal, and water being plentiful. Clay (and bricks) are not good materials to make a base out of: they are conspicuous. However, the swamp is both a blessing and a curse for redstone-oriented players: Water can ruin redstone contraptions, but slimeballs are in high supply here.

### 
Oceans are appealing for players to live in. Oceans spawn in temperature variants, such as warm, lukewarm, normal (basic ocean biome), cold, and frozen. Each one of these (except warm oceans) also have a "deep" variant, allowing for larger underwater structures. All ocean types can contain underwater ruins and shipwrecks, and all deep variants can contain ocean monuments.
