## Farming techniques
Passive mobs spawn seldom after they have been killed, which means that meat eventually runs out if the player keeps killing animals without breeding them. The same is true for plants. A solution to this is to make farms.  The general rule in Minecraft, not just for food but for a variety of other resources, is that a small investment in time and/or resources can get a modest supply, but a larger investment (usually a larger or more automated farm) can get a much more generous supply. Once you have surplus crops, you can also sell them to villagers to earn emeralds.

### Crops
Main article: Tutorials/Crop farming
Most players start a wheat farm first, because wheat seeds are one of the first items you can find (from breaking tall grass). All methods for wheat work the same for the other crops, except that carrots and potatoes don't have separate seeds — you just re-plant the the vegetables (but unlike wheat and beets, you can get more than one of them when you harvest).

Besides seeds, players need dirt/grass, a hoe, light, and water. One source block of water hydrates farmland four blocks in every direction, including diagonally. Therefore, the most effective (using a small area) wheat farm is 9×9 with a source block in the middle.  If you put fences around it to keep out wandering mobs, that requires an 11×11 area. Again, that one source block extends to all tilled soil in the 9×9 areas. That area yields 80 wheat after fully grown. This not only saves water sources but also gives more room to grow crops for less water.

When starting out, you can speed up wheat or other crop growth by planting in alternate rows, with empty farmland or a different crop between. However, once you've gotten to the point where you can plant a whole field in one crop, the speed isn't really worth the trouble of mixed crop, as it's easier to use a water bucket to harvest the whole field at once, and it's quickest to replant the field in a single crop.

After building your first basic plot for wheat, you can just stack more farms above it, every three blocks, for your other crops. The lighting block for each layer can hold up the water for the next. A half-dozen layers let you grow all six basic crops (including pumpkin and melon), and harvest whichever crop you want at the moment.

Villagers can be used to automate breaking and replacing of the crops — see the tutorial linked above for more details.

### Pumpkin and melon farms
Main article: Tutorials/Pumpkin and melon farming
Pumpkins can be found growing in the wild, and these are more useful than melons because pumpkin can be crafted into jack o'lanterns, which are valuable for marking a path and the direction home, and can provide light underwater. Pumpkins can also be used for pumpkin pie, and later to create golems.  A carved pumpkin can also be worn on the player's head to avoid offending endermen.

Melons are a small-change food and eventually used for brewing. In any case, the two crops grow almost identically. They do use farmland, so the same 9×9 plot with a water block works well, but instead of planting the whole field, you plant (almost) half the squares, which grow into vines.  Leave the vines and harvest the fruit that grows next to it. See the tutorial above for advice on how to arrange the fields. Both pumpkins and melons make good crops for sale to villagers. Once you've been to the Nether, observers and other redstone gadgetry can help you automate pumpkin and melon farming.

### Sugar cane farms

Once past the initial stage when players eat any food they can, without bothering with extra preparations, and are ready to craft some more complex items, players may want to start sugar cane farming in order to craft sugar and paper: sugar being a key component of cake, pumpkin pie, and some potions, and paper being required to craft maps, books, bookshelves, cartography tables, enchantment tables, and firework rockets. 

Sugar cane can be placed underwater, where it provides an air bubble.  This trick can be helpful when building underwater structures.

Observers and pistons can be used to automate sugar cane farms.

### Fishing
Main article: Fishing
Once you have a couple of pieces of string for a fishing rod, fishing becomes a useful source of food, experience, and even treasure. Note that fish are in infinite supply, while passive mobs respawn rarely. Fish, while they do not replenish a lot of hunger, can be much easier to obtain compared to other foods. Here is also a chance to fish up treasure such as saddles and enchanted bows and fishing rods. See fishing for more information.

Fishing occasionally catches an enchanted fishing rod, and once you get into enchanting you can even create your own. Any caught rod is badly damaged with low durability, but can be restored by combining it on an anvil with a normal rod. Any rod with Mending repairs itself with use instead of wearing out, especially if it also has Unbreaking. Fishing rods do have a "perfect" enchantment setup, and it's straightforward to create: Once you make a "god rod" with Mending, Unbreaking III, Lure III, and Luck of the Sea III, it lasts forever and provide a steady stream of experience, food, and treasure.

### Animal farming

Ranching, or animal farming, usually refers to breeding animals so that there can be an infinite supply of meat and other passive mob drops. Simply right-click an animal with their "desired" food to breed, and then right-click the same animal with that same food (see "Breeding" for more) To make a simple animal farm, simply make an enclosure with fences and one fence gate to access the farm. Then, lead at least 2 of the animal into the corral and start breeding them. A carpet atop a fence post can also make an entrance that you can easily jump onto, but the animals (or monsters, for that matter) do not recognize it as passable. Having a crop farm nearby helps supply food for breeding.  

Chickens are easiest to start with, as you can "breed" them by breaking their eggs inside the corral, as well as by feeding them any kind of seed. Cows and sheep need to wait until you have wheat to breed them, and pigs need one of the root vegetables (carrot, potato, or beets). You may even be able to raise rabbits (they eat carrots or dandelions) but you need high fences or a deep pit to keep them from jumping out and escaping. More advanced farms can simplify the business: even a basic cow-crusher can practically industrialize your beef supply, and variously automated chicken farms can produce batches or streams of cooked or raw meat and feathers. Sheep are usually farmed for their wool, and that can likewise be automated.
