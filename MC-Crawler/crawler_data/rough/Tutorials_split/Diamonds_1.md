### By Ocean
To do this, the player must have many potions of Water Breathing and Night Vision. Oceans have many ravines which can contain many caves for searching and may contain diamonds at the bottom. It is a profitable way to find diamonds as many ores are already unearthed for you.

### By TNT
Blowing up TNT is one of the fastest ways to mine, but it does require a player to kill a large number of creepers for gunpowder and obtain lots of sand. Given a generous amount of TNT, a player can blow up one at a time, detonate a large clump, or place a block every five meters. TNT drops 100% of its items in Java edition, but this method is not viable in Bedrock edition.

### By branch mining
Branch mining is safer and more reliable than caving but consumes more tool-crafting resources. It also generates a lot of spare cobblestone, gravel, andesite, dirt, diorite, and granite, which, depending on the player, may be viewed as a downside or a benefit. It is advisable to use a silk touch pickaxe for stone as the stone items can be traded for emeralds. Players should prepare 6 or more pickaxes (pickaxe type dependent on current resources) before starting, carry a water bucket, full set of iron armor, 3 stacks of torches, an iron sword, some quality food, a crafting table, a shovel (for clearing dirt and gravel), a shield to block skeleton arrows, and a furnace. Players can use their bucket to store lava from nearby lava pools for some good smelting. Enchant equipment if possible, as even the weakest enchantments make a large difference.

To create a diamond mine, first, get down to the diamond layers. Besides following existing caves, players can just dig a vertical shaft, quarry, or staircase down to the diamond-containing layers (but remember the cardinal rule: don't dig straight down). Most players prefer level 11 because that puts the "lava flood" at foot level. Deeper tunnels are likely to expose lava at head level or from above, but at level 11, lava is likely to be exposed in the floor. This may block further progress, but probably won't flood down the tunnel, and a player cannot fall down a pit into the lava. For Bedrock edition, level 11 also has the biggest chance of finding diamonds. Once at the chosen level, begin branch mining or mining long, level hallways two blocks high and one block wide. Sooner or later (often later), mining exposes a diamond ore blob. Sometimes, the player can find two or more diamond blobs intersecting together while branch mining. Remember that in 1.18+ level mining at level -59, right above bedrock, gives you good odds of getting diamond.

After finding the first diamonds and graduating to enchanting, a player should make and carry one Fortune III pickaxe to multiply the diamonds mined in the future. At this point, enchanting the player's new diamond pickaxe with Fortune seems obvious; however, there is a better way: Enchant the diamond pickaxe with Silk Touch, and keep a separate Fortune III pickaxe (which can be left home instead of risked on trips) for valuable ores. If possible, add Mending to the Fortune pickaxe.

It's likely for a mine to intersect several caves. Since any cave located while mining for diamonds is naturally at the right level for diamonds, it's a good idea to explore (and light) the cave before proceeding with the mine. A cave is likely to have hostile mobs inside.

### Villager trading
Although diamonds themselves are nonrenewable, diamond tools and armor can be renewably obtained via villager trading.
The following diamond items can be renewably obtained via villager trading:

- Diamondpickaxe(renewable from toolsmith villager)
- Diamondsword(renewable from weaponsmith villager)
- Diamondaxe(renewable from toolsmith and weaponsmith villagers)
- Diamondshovel(renewable from toolsmith villager)
- Diamondhoe(renewable from toolsmith villager)
- Diamondarmor(renewable from armorer villager)

## Mining diamonds
A diamond item.
Upon finding a block or blob of diamond ore, a player must mine it to get the diamond it contains. Before doing this, though, make sure the area is safe: after all, players don't want to lose any diamonds.

First, if the you located the diamond ore by caving, then you should light up or block off any nearby dark areas to avoid getting blown up or shot while attempting to mine. Flood any lava nearby, turning it into obsidian (then go back and light up any areas which are now dark).

Next, dig away all blocks touching the blob, both to expose the whole blob and to make sure the diamonds don't drop into lava and burn. Any lava found should be flooded with water. If this results in obsidian next to the diamonds that cannot be mined away, the area should be flooded and then the diamonds can be mined, to quench any newly-exposed lava while mining.

Now that it's safe to mine, use an iron, diamond, or netherite pickaxe to break the blocks. They drop one gem each, unless mined with a pickaxe enchanted with the Fortune enchantment. Fortune III, the highest level, can cause as many as four diamonds to drop, and on average multiplies the yield of a diamond blob by 2.2. Remember to dig around diamond blobs, as diamond ores can form diagonally in the same blob.

If you don't have a Fortune pickaxe but a Silk Touch pickaxe instead, then you can mine the diamond ore to obtain it in block form. Ore can then be stored elsewhere until obtaining a Fortune pickaxe, so you can mine it with a higher yield.

Once in possession of diamonds, it's best to proceed directly to a safe place to stash them in a chest; this could be a home base or a secure mining outpost. Be careful to make the chest secure from attacks by creepers, or the precious new-found wealth could go up in smoke.
