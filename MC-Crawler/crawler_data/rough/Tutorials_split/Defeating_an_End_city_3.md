## Saving some shulkers
Although it may be tempting to kill all the shulkers in an end city, ideally you want to intentionally keep some shulkers alive, because they can be useful in their living form. Shulkers can be useful in two cases: for the "How Did We Get Here?" advancement, and for building a shulker farm.

In Java Edition, the hidden advancement "How Did We Get Here?" requires the player to obtain most obtainable status effects at once, including Levitation. Because shulkers are the only source of the Levitation effect, which only lasts 10 seconds, it is necessary to transport a shulker to the Overworld in close range with sources of other rare effects.

A more practical use of the shulker is a shulker farm, which is the only way to obtain shulker shells and shulker boxes renewably, and is a must-have for long-term multiplayer servers. In Java Edition, the shulkers produced from shulker farms can further be used to construct a mob switch, which can prevent hostile mobs from spawning elsewhere in the same dimension.

To save (and later transport) the shulkers, the best technique is to capture them in boats. Because they cannot walk like most mobs do, shulkers must be transported in vehicles like boats and minecarts. Putting them in boats also keeps them from teleporting.

## Special rooms
When exploring end cities, you may find special rooms.

### Treasure room
This is what a treasure room looks like inside of an end city, with 1 chest and 1 ender chest.
If a room has chests, simply collect the loot. Some rooms will have an ender chest beside the regular chest. Bring a pickaxe with the silk touch enchantment to pick these up.

### Large shulker room
Large shulker rooms have a spiral staircase around the edge, but it is much easier to go down than up. An easier way is to pillar jump, killing shulkers as you go. Another way of going up is letting a shulker hit you, use the levitation effect. If you want to try this, make sure that you have a good armor. After killing the shulkers, go down the spiral staircase and collect the shulker loot, or use a fishing rod.

An easy strategy to use is to sit at the top of the stairs leading to the room, looking down, and blocking with your shield. At first, almost every bullet will hit you, but as you float up, more will be caught by the shield. Make sure you keep yourself aligned to the middle of the room, and then land at the top with the loot chests. This strategy is effective because it causes the majority of the shulkers to start fighting each other. Generally speaking, by the time you finish raiding the loot chests, most of the shulkers are either dead or severely weakened.

If the room branches out at the top, place ladders along the walls and continue exploring.

### End ship
Before going to the ship, make sure you have the necessary equipment for end cities. In addition, have an ender pearl and some chorus fruit (both of which are fairly easy to obtain in the end).

To enter, you need to throw the ender pearl onto the roof of the ship or build a one block wide bridge to the ship. Then, you can go inside, and then to the treasure chamber. First, kill the shulker. Then collect the elytra and chest loot. 

Finally, go to the bow of the ship (the front), where the dragon head is. Place blocks around and under the head. Once it is secure, you can mine the head and return to the ground by building a bridge back to the pier, eating chorus fruit, or teleporting using an ender pearl. Alternatively, you can use your elytra to get back to the pier.

Because end ships contain extremely rare items, it is recommended to put the items in an ender chest. If the end city doesn't have one, but you brought an eye of ender, a diamond pickaxe and a crafting table, just mine the obsidian on the bottom of the ship and then you can make an ender chest. Just like the dragon head, mine the purpur blocks around the obsidian and place blocks under the obsidian to prevent the obsidian from falling down. You can also simply mine the obsidian and then jump off the edge of the ship, be sure to place some water on the bottom before you hit the ground. 

## Tactics
Shulker shells are useful. Keep as many as you can, and using the chests from in the cities, you can create shulker boxes. It is recommended to store stackable loot separately from the non-stackable loot. You may only need one shulker box to store the stackable items, but you will definitely need more than one shulker box for non-stackable loot. If you really would like to go on a spree, you can clear out your ender chest, as these can hold boxes too. Since the chances of death and/or getting lost are so high, it is best to store your loot in an ender chest. Unfortunately, recursive tactics don't work here, as shulker boxes cannot hold shulker boxes. However, the combination of shulker boxes and an ender chest allows for a quick and easy way to get home via the void.though you will lose your exp doing this and it doesn't work on hardcore).
