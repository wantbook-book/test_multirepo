### Silk touch
- TheSilk Touchenchantment is surprisingly useful when mining. If you mine, for example,redstone oreorlapis lazuli orewith a Fortune-enchanted pick, you end up with several pieces of redstone or lapis lazuli for every block you mine. If you mine with Silk Touch, you mine the entire block, and thus it takes up much less inventory space. This allows you to do a lot more mining before you need to return to base and unload. Back at base, you can then use your best 'Fortune' pick to maximize yield from the blocks collected. This decreases the risk of losing the enchanted tool, as well as increasing the time you can spend mining.
- Silk Touch is ahugetimesaver when building anything large or even moderately-sized out of regular stone or even stone bricks. This is because a pickaxe with Silk Touch picks up the stone, instead of converting it into cobblestone. This saves all of the coal and smelting time involved in converting cobblestone into stone, letting you use the stone to build or craft into stone bricks almost immediately.

### Snow harvesting
To harvest large volumes of snow quickly, build a snow golem in a confined space so that it cannot move. Then fill your inventory with stone or even wooden shovels. Click and hold (don't spam-click) at the base of the golem, generating enormous numbers of snowballs. An even faster technique is to first dig another block, then slide your cursor to the snow, resulting in extremely rapid digging. Keep switching to new shovels as they break. Collect the snowballs at intervals, and if you need inventory space, craft them into snow blocks, sixteen at a time. By this method, in one Minecraft day, you can use eight stone shovels to make roughly four stacks of snow blocks or 16 stacks of snowballs. Shovels break quickly, with the shovel lasting for about as many seconds as its durability divided by 10; so gold shovels break in 3 seconds, stone shovels (the preferred method) break in 13 seconds, iron in 25 seconds, and diamond in about 150 seconds.
Notes:

- Snow golemsdo not leavesnowtrails inplains,swamps,deserts,beaches,jungles,mushroom islands, or theNether. In deserts, jungles and the Nether, they also rapidly take damage and are hard to keep alive. If you're stuck in a bad biome but are near a river or ocean, try to build a platform over the water.
- There is a trick that allows you to leave the mouse clicked while snow generates. This, however, breaks shovels quickly (a gold shovel breaks almost instantly, and a diamond one breaks in roughly two minutes).

### Split mines into sections
When mining a new area, place barriers at intervals. Fences and cobblestone walls are ideal. This helps stop mobs sneaking up behind you unexpectedly, and allows you to mark sections of your mine as 'safe'. If you encounter a mob in a 'safe' area, your fence prevents it from attacking you, and you now have an indication that an area is insufficiently lit, or that there is an opening you have not discovered. This trick can save a great deal of time in narrowing down where an unexpected mob has come from.

### Sprint everywhere
Once your food supplies are secure, or if you are playing in Peaceful mode, you can speed things up a little by sprinting everywhere. Double-tapping the forward button or using your sprint button (default is Left Ctrl) causes you to sprint. In harder game modes you should avoid doing this until you have plenty of food available, because it uses a lot more energy than walking for only a slight speed-up. However, if you can sprint while holding the jump button, you can go a lot faster. But be careful, or you waste hunger by hitting an object above you.

### Sugar cane
When clearing water out from an area, a common trick is to make a drydock by dropping sand or gravel into the water, thereby displacing it, then digging all of the sand or gravel out again, leaving a dry area surrounded by a curtain wall. In sloped areas, sugar cane can do the same job as sand or gravel, but because sugarcane can be placed only on blocks that have water adjacent, the older sugar cane blocks automatically uproot as soon as they no longer have water next to them. This saves having to dig them out as a separate stage. In deeper water, the occasional column of sugarcane can act as an airlock, making it quick and easy to move outside the dry area and float to the top level of the drydock.

Notes:

- Because sugar cane can be placed only on dirt, sand or grass, you sometimes need to place some of these blocks first.
- It's unlikely to completely clear a volume of water using only sugarcane. There are usually a few spots where sugarcane cannot be placed, and in these places the water must be displaced in the usual way or collected using a bucket.
- This method works only on sloped areas. You can't fill a completely flat area with sugarcane because it needs a water block one meter below its own level before it can be placed.

### Tame wolves
- If you use tamedwolvesfor hunting, and choose not to use theflint and steeltrick to pre-cook passive mobs, then one punch to a passive mob focuses your wolves on it, and they quickly kill it without further effort by you. You can then collect its meat and experience orbs.
- If you are building and your wolves are in your way, lead them away from the building and right-click on them to make them sit. They stay seated in that spot until you right-click on them again.

### TNT
- TNTis useful for rapid clearing of areas, especially when resource collection is not a concern. Two blocks ofTNTcan easily remove 50 blocks of dirt or gravel, and multiple blocks can clear entire stone caverns much more quickly than could be done by hand.
- One block of TNT sets off other blocks of TNT when it explodes. Because of this, you do not have to set off each TNT, saving time. This doesn't work if the TNT is too far away from other TNT.
