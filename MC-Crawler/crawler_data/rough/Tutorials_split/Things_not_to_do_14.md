#### Tools as melee weapons
The player should always carry a good melee weapon with them. Many tools cause less damage to mobs than a sword, are slower, and lose durability quickly when used for combat.

An axe deals high damage and can also chop wood faster. Many axes deal the same amount of damage, meaning any axe, even below diamond, can deal at least as much damage as a diamond sword, and if enchanted, possibly even a netherite sword; however, axes are more expensive and have much slower attack speeds than swords, so the player may find them less useful if they often miss their melee attacks. Axes have another use in the ability to disable shields temporarily for any fights the player ends up in against another player. [Java Edition only] On Bedrock Edition axes only do 1 less damage than their sword counterparts, making them a good backup weapon if your sword is lost or broken.

Shovels deal 1.5 HP less damage and pickaxes deal 2 HP less damage than swords. Hoes were useless until 1.16 where they now do 1 damage less than the sword of the same tier, previously having done the same damage as fists.

For more details on what weapon causes what amount of the damage, see "damage".

#### Using gold for armor and weapons
Even though golden tools do work faster than netherite (excluding blocks that golden tools cannot mine such as obsidian and most ores), and are much easier to enchant than diamond or iron, or even netherite, they have poor durability. Instead, the player should use gold to barter with piglins, or craft golden apples for a high-saturation and fast-healing food, golden carrots for high-saturation food or night-vision potions, glistering melon slice for potions of healing, or powered rails.

The exception to this is if the player has a gold farm. If they do, then gold becomes an easily renewable resource. Zombified piglins drop gold ingots and nuggets upon death, making gold renewable. Gold is also better than leather armor in all cases, so if the player does not have enough iron to make a full set of armor, gold is good for their armor. However, the player is likely to get more iron than gold, unless they find a badlands biome, where gold can be found near the surface. Another exception is a golden helmet or boots if you plan to spend large amounts of time near piglins.

Here are some examples of how weak golden tools are: 

- A gold sword withUnbreakingIII has around the same durability as a stone sword.
- A gold sword withSharpnessV does the damage of a non-enchanted diamond sword.

#### 
Using a tool on leaves is a bad idea, because it drains the uses the player's tool has. If the player were to use a tool on all of the leaves on a tree, not even an iron tool would last long. It is just as fast for the player to use their fists or any non-tool items on leaves as it uses a tool other than a sword or shears on a leaf block or grass. The player should use shears on leaves or grass if they want to collect leaf blocks as an item. A player cutting through a lot of leaves or cobwebs may choose to make a few disposable stone swords to use as machetes. If the player is on version 1.16+, a hoe should be used instead, as most hoes can insta-mine the leaves. It is a great idea to enchant this hoe with Fortune, as that increases the drop rate of sticks and saplings, as well as apples from oak trees. This is an especially good idea when trying to obtain jungle saplings, as their drop rate is much lower.

#### Using axes for beds
Breaking a bed with an axe takes just as long as breaking with one's hand. It also consumes the durability of the axe. Either way, a bed can be broken quickly with a fist, just as with another tool.

#### Using pickaxes with rare enchantments
The player should not use a pickaxe enchanted with Fortune to mine stone as this yields no extra stone and wastes the enchanted pickaxe's durability. A good idea is to bring an iron pickaxe to mine stone, andesite, or diorite because these are not affected by Fortune.

There are two exceptions to this:

- If the player has a tool enchanted with Mending. With the advent of theMendingenchantment, players do not need to always look to use the perfect tool for each job as it is perfectly conceivable to have any tool such as pickaxes last indefinitely if the tools are enchanted and the player practices diligence in repairing tools with experience.

- If the player can trade that pickaxe (tool smith), or the enchants in book form (librarian), from a villager.

#### Disposing of low-durability items
No player wants to use tools that are about to break, so many players just throw low-durability tools out, even if they are valuable. An item with low durability can still be used. The player can also use old tools to repair them. Low-durability items could be kept in a chest in case the player dies and loses their stuff. Any scrap tools or armor made of iron or gold can be chucked in the furnace to obtain a nugget and old wooden tools and weapons can instead be used as furnace fuel.

The downside of using objects with low durability is that they may break while being used, forcing the player to craft new tools or carry extra tools. This is a problem, especially for weapons and armor. The player could instead store low-durability items while new items are being used so the pieces of equipment can be combined later.

Fortunately, the Mending enchantment enables one to repair any item they are holding in their main hand, offhand, and any currently worn armor using experience from any source, even if some may not consider experience for 2 durability a good trade. (Note: All of the said items need an individual Mending enchantment in order for this to work.)
