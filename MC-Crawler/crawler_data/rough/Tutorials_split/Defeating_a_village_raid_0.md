## Raid basics
Raids are events during which pillagers, vindicators, ravagers, and evokers (which can summon vexes) invade a village to kill as many villagers as possible (witches also spawn but they are passive to villagers, they also attack iron golems and the player and heal other illagers with beneficial potions). They can be difficult to tackle early-game and can result in many villager deaths if not properly handled.

## Equipment
- Aniron  swordat minimum.SharpnessandFire Aspectallow quicker elimination of enemies, whileLootingenables more loot from the pillagers and vindicators ‌[Bedrock Edition  only].
- A full set ofdiamond armorat minimum.Protectionensures better survivability and reduces damage from evocation fangs that would otherwise bypass armor and shields.
- Tools, which may be useful to hide villagers underground if blocking doors is not a feasible option, to unblock houses after the raid, and so forth.
- Ashieldto guard against attacks and stunravagers, except for vindicator blows, as their axes can disable shields.
- Aboworcrossbowas your ranged weapon to take out raiders from a distance.PowerandFlamecan quickly dispatch most raiders, if not one-shot them. If you are using a bow that doesn't haveInfinityor can't one-shot raiders,arrows of poisoncan help dispatch raiders. Punch II can be used to knock back enemies away from you.
- Plenty of nutritiousfood, such assteakandbread, to regenerate health.
- Awater bucketfor getting up or down easily; necessary for all missions regardless of difficulty! Using  a water bucket can also push vindicators away from you, and they can't go against the flow of the water, allowing you to take down the vindicators quicker.
- A stack or more of expendable blocks to barricade village houses.
- Iron blocksandcarved pumpkins. This can summon iron golems providing additional reinforcements to the village. Unlike golems that are spawned by villagers, they won't attack you even if you hurt them.
- Abedto set your spawn point at or near the village, in a safe house where you can regroup after getting killed.

### Optional equipment
- Someender pearlsfor quick escapes.
- milk bucket, to remove negative status effects from the witches that could affect your performance.
- negative splash potions, to hinder groups of raiders.
- Positive potions such as Strength II, Fire Resistance +, Swiftness II, Regeneration II and Instant Health II to buff you up against the raiders.
- Golden apples to tank enemy attacks and provide a swift healing cover.
- cobwebs orpowder snowto trap raiders.
- Alava bucketfor quickly eliminatingravagersand other mobs (excluding witches, which drinkFire Resistance potions).
- Any expendable blocks (such as cobblestone, netherack or dirt) for utility purposes (such as pillaring up or blocking up enemies).
- Aboatorminecartto trap any melee raiders (preferablyvindicatorsor ravagers) to trap them so you can kill them without them chasing you (you can also do this with pillagers, but try to block or dodge the arrows).
- Bells to reveal where the raiders are if you can't find them.‌[Java Edition  only]
- Atotem of undyingas a last resort in case you take fatal damage.

## Preparation
### Getting good gear
Good gear is required to start a raid. Good gear increases your chances of survivability and the victory of a raid. For armour, get the Protection IV, Unbreaking III, Mending and Feather Falling IV. For the sword, get Sweeping Edge III, Sharpness V, Fire Aspect II, Unbreaking III and Mending. For the bow, get Infinity, Power V, Flame, Punch II and Unbreaking III. For the axe, get Efficiency V, Sharpness V, Unbreaking III and Mending. Optional weapons include a crossbow enchanted with Quick Charge III, Piercing IV or Multishot, Unbreaking III and Mending, a trident enchanted with Riptide III, Unbreaking III and Mending and a shield enchanted with Unbreaking III and Mending. Shields are recommended substitute to a totem, in case this is your first time to start a raid. Be aware though that shields are disabled 100% of the time when a vindicator with an axe hits you while your shield is up for 5 seconds, so try to run away when your shield is disabled. A bunch of totems can be handy to get out of sticky situations and potions can provide beneficial effects to you.

### Preparing the village
Before the raid starts, a good idea is to prepare the village before the raiders attack. There are multiple ways to do so: 

#### Walling off the village
A solid strategy is to wall off the perimeter of the village using a strong block, such as cobblestone or wood. As there are no ways for raiders to destroy solid blocks, they will not be able to penetrate the wall, and will, therefore, be stuck attempting to pathfind around it. Once you have walled off your village, you can use ladders to scale the wall and shoot the raiders with a bow. You can alternatively use walls or fences to border your village. Be aware that pillagers can still shoot and evokers can summon their fang attack or vexes to attack both the villagers and iron golems. You may also use moats with lava, magma blocks, berry bushes or fire to protect from most hostile mobs.
