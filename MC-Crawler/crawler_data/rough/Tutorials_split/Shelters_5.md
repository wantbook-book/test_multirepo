### Cake factory
A cake factory simply provides the avenue to quickly produce cake by having the necessary ingredients nearby and produced in a close area, most commonly in one large factory type building. To make a cake factory, make a wheat farm, a sugar cane farm, an egg farm, and a cow in a cage (make the cage so you can milk the cow.). Place a crafting table and a chest. Once you have enough materials from the farms, start making cakes. This is a good thing to put under/next to a dining hall in multiplayer.

### 
Consider building a road or a path between your buildings or to the nearest village. Remember to keep it well lit so no mobs spawn! A good material is dirt path or cobblestone 

### Cobblestone generator
See also: Tutorials/Cobblestone farming

A cobblestone generator provides a safe and convenient way to gather cobblestone. They typically involve mixing water and lava.

### Bunker
Sometimes called a panic room, a Bunker is a small room made of strong materials (obsidian for example) with an iron door with the open/close system inside the room. This room must have a bed, a crafting table, a furnace and also a chest with the basic materials (food, tools, armor and weapons are a must). It also has to have a high interior luminosity to avoid monsters spawning inside. It should also be only two blocks tall so endermen can't teleport inside.

### Panic room
A panic room is a place meant just for fun, where you put the entrance somewhere where you wouldn't go looking for another room, e.g. the drain in a shower because if using a trapdoor for the drain you can open it.

### Scout tower
A cheap and safe way to survey the land. Note that these are mostly obsoleted by maps, should you have the resources to make them, although a map doesn't tell you if there are any aggressive mobs. Remember to keep a spyglass at the top!

### Seed and flower farm
You can have a fully-automatic flower and seed farm with just a bit of Redstone and tons of bone meal! Have an 8×8 area of grass with some hoppers at the end. Then, place a row dispensers at the back, facing the grass, and put buckets of water in them. Hook up some Redstone from a BUD switch at the end and delay with Repeaters. Attach another line of Redstone and hook it up to Dispensers, under the Grass and filled with bone meal while facing the Grass on top. If you do it right, automatic block updates should cause grass and flowers to grow and immediately be destroyed by the water flow and be carried along the stream and have the water automatically get sucked in. XisumaVoid made a good tutorial.

### 
A tall tower with some sort of light source on the top means that you can see your base from a long distance away. Handy if you go exploring a lot, your spawn point is a long way from your base, or you have not made a bed yet.

### Beacon room
Make this room by digging a 6×6×6 hole and building the base pyramid out of your selected material (Iron is cheapest unless you have a trading hall, but you can also use netherite, diamonds, emeralds and gold). Also, you could put in a few chests with diamonds, netherite, iron, emeralds and gold and/or make it look like an altar.

### Garage
If you like cars, then you might want to build a garage. A garage is just a big room with enough space to build some cars and a garage door at one end so you can drive your cars outside. Some garages are really big and have lots of decorations, like workshops, car lifts, or crazy things like waterfalls or a secret underground garage. When you have finished your garage, remember to build a few cars to fill up the garage.

### 
If you have tamed a lot of wolves, a kennel is a good place to keep them. A simple shed-like structure suffices, but be sure to keep it well lit for the wolf's safety. A pet area is similar to a kennel, but keeps wolves and cats. For a more realistic feel, separate them.

### Well
A renewable water source is useful for a variety of projects. Put water in a 1×3 ditch and you can take water repeatedly from the center! For a more aesthetically pleasing pool, a 2×2 well works as well, and you can take water from any of the squares.

### Mushroom farm
A big room with flat floor for growing mushrooms. You can light your farm by torches or glowstone, placed on ceiling, to prevent mobs from appearing. Just make sure that there are no places on the floor where the light level is greater than 12. If you have the material, redstone torches are good for this. More about this can be found on the Tutorials/Mushroom farming page. Alternatively, find a small cave or make one, put some mushrooms inside and completely seal it off without torches and check on it/clean it out. Also provides the drops from hostile mobs.

### Sugar cane and cactus farms
See also: Tutorials/Sugar cane farming and Cactus farming

Easier to manage but somewhat less useful than the above two projects, farming sugar cane and cactus underground requires little effort. A cactus farm requires sand to grow, and sugar cane needs to be properly irrigated with water within one block of it. If you don't want to spend lots of time harvesting your cactus, place a three-block-tall pillar next to where you want your cactus (See Farming for more info).

### Indoor animal farm
Light up a large enclosed area and then put two of the same kind of passive mobs (i.e., two pigs or two cows) inside. You can then breed them together and you can gather wool, leather, raw porkchop, beef and raw chicken safely. You might want to put a grass block floor so that sheep can regrow wool, trees inside so the animals feel more comfortable, or, if you're really ambitious, build a man-made forest.
