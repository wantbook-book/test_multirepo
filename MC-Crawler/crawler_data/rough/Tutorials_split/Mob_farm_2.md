#### Compact canal design
Compact Canal design
 An easily-built design can be made in a 20×20 area, using eight water source blocks to fill the channels, which are exactly eight blocks long so that the water stops exactly at the edges of the central hole. The design can be easily stacked or placed next to each other to increase the effectiveness. This design can be made even smaller as shown in the video (14×14 area). Shrinking the design can be done by using signs to cut off the water flow at the edge of the sinkhole, forcing the mobs to fall into the central hole.

#### Minimal canal design

 If there is not enough space for larger designs, this might be used. Its small size of 10×10 or 20×20 (inner area) makes it able to be incorporated into larger construction projects without trouble. It uses four water source blocks, one in each corner, with the water flowing around 3×3 squares of building material to the central hole. The parts of the water between the wall and the blocks is closed over to provide more spawning area.

#### Large chamber fully automatic design
Large Chamber Fully Automatic
This is a large farm that requires significant resources. It has 6 spawn chambers in each building, and redstone controlling it. It outputs 4 waves of average 10-15 mobs every 16 or so seconds.

#### Water pans
If you have mobs coming in from multiple sources, you may need a water pan (a.k.a. water tray) to collect mobs from a large area to a central dropshaft.  

A basic 9×9 (not counting the walls) water tray works well for zombie or skeleton spawners, or when gathering together the output of several dark areas.  Simply put water sources at the corners of the square, and they flow to drop the mobs into a hole in the central square.  For spiders or iron golems, you must expand this to 10×10, which allows for a 2×2 hole in the middle (for spiders, you must also line the chute with glass).

For a few cases (notably Overworld gold farms), a 27×27 water tray (counting the walls!), with two levels, may be needed.  Start with a classic 9×9 pan surrounding the drop chute. Move up a level to surround it with the rest of the large pan — slabs or blocks suffice for most of it (put real blocks at the boundary, so you can place water on them), but the outer ring should be a 25×25 square of fences on the same level (that is, you'd have a half-step up from the outer pan to the fences).  Surround this with the 27×27 outer wall.  The inner pan gets a water source at each corner, which should send the flow in to surround the hole.  For the outer pan, water sources go every other block on top of the fences (place them against the outer wall), but not in a complete ring.  Place the sources every other space along two opposite walls; the water should flow exactly to the edge of the inner pan. Now, if you fill in the entirety of the other walls, you get extra water sources forming from the corners, and your current becomes a sheet of mostly-still water. For the other two walls, put only five sources each covering the middle — that is, one at the midpoint, and two on each side (still every other space).  This sends the water flow to the other edges of the inner pan.

The large pan could also be expanded to 28×28 with a 10×10 inner pan, but this requires some experimentation.

### Active mob displacement
The Canal-Style System still suffers from the mobs freezing when outside a certain range around your character in Java Edition, and from the limitations of low population density caps in Bedrock Edition. Active Systems can correct that problem. One example is using Redstone and Dispensers filled with a Water bucket to flood the spawning grounds repeatedly, flushing all mobs into the channels to be transported to the grinders. Thus, the farm provides area for the mobs to spawn in, but does not rely on mob movement to get them into the grinder. Using this, one can omit the trapdoors needed for the other, passive designs.

In Bedrock Edition placing water on top of scaffolding provides an efficient means of active transport. Land mobs spawn with their feet inside of the scaffolding and their heads inside of the flowing water. The mobs are then immediately transported to a drop chute or other killing area. Spiders and baby mobs present a challenge for water-on-scaffolding designs because they spawn entirely inside of the scaffolding and cannot be moved by the water until they randomly climb/jump. Several methods have been invented to deal with this: buttons placed every-other block in every-other row prevents spiders from spawning at all; villagers can be used to lure baby zombies (see below); snow golems can be used to knock mobs upward and into the flowing water; or cascading water down a funnel-shaped spawn floor can be used to pull babies and spiders into the water flow at every block.

### Other designs
Instead of using water to transport mobs, there are various other methods to make them move toward the grinder, each of which may work better with certain mobs but with other tradeoffs.

- Sunlight mob farm:Undead mobs seek protection from sunlight. A roof three blocks above the ground can provide a shady area to lure undead mobs into a pit lined with open trap doors, leading into a grinder. The disadvantage of the farm is that it attracts only zombies and skeletons.
- Villager:Onlyzombiesanddrownedare attracted tovillagers.   This method works by having one or more villagers trapped (but protected from actual attack).  Any nearby zombies go toward the villagers. You can make a maze that the zombies have to go through so that you need only one trap. However, there should be some sort of trap that the zombies fall into to get to the villagers (e.g. a ton of soul sand in water or in air, fall damage, etc.).
- Turtle eggs:This method works onzombies,drownedandzombified piglins.Turtle eggsattract all variations of zombies, which want to trample them.  Turtle eggs can be used in combination with open trapdoors above a drop to lure any zombie-variant mobs into a killing chamber. It is a popular choice for zombified piglin farms in the nether, and can be used as a method to lure zombies away from other mobs in a standard mob farm.
- One-way doors:Relying on the random movement of mobs, One-Way Door Designs use doors or pistons to prevent the mobs from wandering backward. Making several sets of doors can increase the speed with which the mobs move toward the hole.
	- The easiest configuration consists of a wall of iron doors or fence gates (you can use wooden doors if you're not on Hard difficulty) with a row of pressure plates in front of them. When the mobs walk onto the pressure plates, the door opens, letting them through, but once on the other side, they can't open the door since there is no switch.
	- With pistons, the arrangement is reversed, with the pressure plates on the desired side, and the pistons pointing upward, so that they block the path of the mobs when extended. This design works only with a 2-block high roof to prevent the mobs from jumping, and even then might fail on spiders. However, it requires considerably more common ingredients than the iron door variant.
	- Such systems can also be used to "store" mobs after gathering them from the farm, so that they later can be killed for the rare drops and experience
- Slime:This farm design uses large slimes to push mobs off ledges. The simplest way to get these slimes are through a slime farm. As for the rates, it gets over 20,000 items per hour, as said in the video title.
- Cats:Creepers flee from cats.  This can be used to redirect the creepers away from other mobs, and/or to their own killing chamber. Similarly, skeletons and wither skeletons flee from wolves.
