### In a cave
If you found a cave system you can fix it up into a lairâ€”a good one can make a base for the rest of your game. If it ends quickly, then cap off your entrance. If it does not end, then build a little shelter around you by capping off any extra exits or openings into the depths. Don't worry too much about the natural walls of the cave; monsters can still be heard through the walls pretty loudly, but they can't come through unless you leave an opening. 

To block the cave off, for your first night you can use walls of dirt or cobblestone similarly to the "hole in the wall". If you have enough wood, you may be able to craft fences and a fence gate and place them across the entrance and any openings in back. Make sure you place the walls or fences behind the upper lip of the cave (or extend the ceiling over the barrier), or monsters are liable to "drop in" inside your barrier. Also, remember to light the area before you settle down. Likewise, remove any stray blocks, within two spaces outside the fence, from which monster could jump onto the fence (try the jump yourself). If using fences, also make sure you can retreat into the cave and away from the entrance (out of sight or 16 blocks away), or a creeper may drop by and just wait for you to come out. Later, you can be more sophisticated about sealing off and fortifying your lair.

As with "Hole in the wall", you can dig into the cave's wall while waiting for dawn, but keep some blocks handy to patch up any openings you might make into another cave while digging, which might have a hostile mob in it. If you place your pickaxe one of your hotbar slots (used to navigate quickly between items you are carrying in your inventory) and e.g. dirt is placed right next to it, you can quickly switch between your tool and that block type in order to close the hole you just made. This can be extremely handy when you stumble upon an opening which contains mobs.

### Hill Fort
Just like cave systems and bunkers and Castle tower.
Hill forts are forts that can be made by strong or earth-made materials such as dirt or stone. Unlike castle or an outpost tower,hill forts have better defenses and you can create your own cave system for hidden base and hidden storage for your important stuff. You can also create your bunker directly within the fort or near the fort. Hill forts are better for PvP bases and raid farming since you can hide magma blocks under a trapdoor and make a lava flow. 

For starter Hill fort, you can just make it out of dirt or any earth-made materials like sand and gravel. 

For easy Hill fort, make it from any wooden materials like oak log and oak planks. 

For normal Hill fort, this can be made with any stone materials such as cobblestone and smooth stone. You can also install defenses using magma blocks and deep hill moat. 

For hard Hill fort, make it from obsidian so nobody could destroy it easily. You can install deadly traps such as night activating lava trap. 

For advanced and intense Hill fort, it's still can be made with obsidian but with new cave system and maze system so raiders can't find you or your loot easily. 

Anyway, you can install any traps even if you're still starter. Cave systems and maze can be done two even when you are still in starter fort. Forts are amazing in raid farming since you can install traps in it to kill raiders (except vexes).

### Out to sea
If you are near an ocean, you can make a boat (see that page for the recipe) and sail out to where you can barely see land (in any direction). If you can't make a boat, just swim out to the sea, holding the space bar all night to keep yourself afloat. Either way, you won't be getting any crafting or smelting done. Note that drowned can board your boat and cause damage, so getting to land and building a shelter is preferable.

### Break the golden rule
When you're desperate, you can break the golden rule of minecraft (Don't dig straight down). Dig three blocks down, and put a block above you that is not sand/gravel. Congrats, you just made the fastest shelter in Minecraft possible. Since you probably don't have an in-game clock yet, you may want to use a real-world clock to time the night (7 minutes, with up to 3 more to allow for dawn/dusk). If you have dirt or stone next to you, you can dig out a couple of blocks there, and place your crafting table and furnace. Sometimes keep the hole in the ground as a base. A torch makes your little hidey hole feel a little less like a tomb.

### Vertical hidey hole

This design allows you to see what is going on every time you come out, but it does require a bit of extra wood.

Once you reach stone, you can mine some of the stone, craft a furnace, make charcoal, and craft torches.

The next morning, check for mobs, particularly creepers, as you climb out.

## Blocks to use
- Cobblestone
- Deepslateand its variants.
- Wool
- Nether quartz
- Terracotta, both plain and stained
- Concrete
- Obsidian
- Bricks
- Stoneandstone bricks
- Sandstone
- Nether bricks
- Woodplanks
- Woodlogs
- Wooden door
- Decoration blocks:
	- Stairsandslabsfor a sloping roof and for tables or chairs
	- Woolorcarpetsfor the floor
	- Glassandglass panesfor windows
	- fenceorcobblestone wallsfor pillars, fences and other decorations
	- Torchesfor lighting to stop mobs spawning
	- Extraterracottais nice too
	- Stained glassis decorative

These materials are good because they are:

- More or less easily obtained.
- Fairly nice-looking (if used correctly).

If you want a certain theme, such as the Nether or the End, certain materials such as nether bricks or end stone from those dimensions can be used.
If you're in Creative or have easy access to sand, glass often looks nice, and you do not need torches. Use it for a greenhouse look, or just if you like the sunshine.
