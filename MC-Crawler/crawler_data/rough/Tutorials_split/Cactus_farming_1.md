## Automatic designs
Automatic cactus farms work on the principle that if there is space available above a cactus, but there is a block next to where the new cactus block will be, then the cactus will grow and immediately break off. This principle can be used to create massive yet lag efficient designs.  Note that any adjacent block will break a cactus, not just a full block.

### Efficient design
The design of a cactus farm is critical to its efficiency. These points can help you to design farms with greater yields than you could otherwise obtain.

- The more densely packed a cactus farm is, the more cactus will be broken. It is important to not be fooled by the number of cacti fit into a space, but rather to look at the output of cacti based on the space. The best farms balance density and efficiency so that the highest yield is obtained.

- It is also important to choose a good block to break the cactus growth with.
	- Using a full block such as dirt is inefficient, since the cactus items are likely to land on the cactus (and be destroyed).
	- The best blocks are those with a thin hitbox such as afence post,iron barorglass pane.  When a cactus hits a fence post, it is much more likely to fall down to the ground rather than onto the cactus plant.
	- Blocks without a hitbox, such as fence gates or even signs, will also work, but the build will be more expensive and/or complex.

- Items can also hit the block above a cactus. If they do so, they can lose their momentum and fall back down onto the cactus. A half block space above the grown cactus should be sufficient to prevent this.
- As noted in the video below, there is one exception to the above:End rodswill not break an adjacent cactus block, so they can be used to further guide the dropped items.

### Advanced designs
Additional complexity permits more compact (higher yield per space) designs.

### Standard automatic
Another common design




























A common design, replace the vines with string
A standard cacti farm usually looks something like this. Designs like these are not very efficient, however, when built on a large scale, they can produce thousands of cacti per hour. Usually water streams are placed at the bottom to wash the cacti into hoppers.

### Xisumavoid design






































The basis of the modified Xisumavoid design
This design uses efficient design principles to get higher output per block. Note that the iron bar in the schematic could be replaced with a fence post or glass pane.

To construct this design, first create a large square out of slabs. Next, place sand blocks every other block. Finally, place in water streams so that all the cacti flow into hoppers. Repeat this process above the bottom to stack the farm. As there are no pictures, it will probably be helpful to see the design in the video.
