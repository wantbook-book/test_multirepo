### Cobblestone mining strategies for superflat desert
Your primary objective for mining in the endless desert is to obtain cobblestone and so 'Enter the Stone Age'. The Sand Age, Stick Age, and Cactus Age are decidedly less famous—and for good reason. In a Superflat desert, with no tools, you face digging through 8 layers of sand (about 48 blocks worth before you're roofed over by sandstone) and then through about 52 layers of sandstone, by hand. That is no mean feat. The intent is to expose stone and then persuade a willing creeper to blast it into cobblestone. Then, there's the whole problem of getting a crafting table, but that's another story. Here are some strategies for the "Big Dig"—in all cases, first use F3 to check your altitude, and check the world settings, so you know how far you have to dig.

#### Double staircase
- Mark a central point with a tall marker, facing west, so the setting sun casts a shadow hopefully.
- Mark off a distance from the central marker, on either side equal to the depth you need to go down. Don't get this wrong. Add a little extra (not much), if you are unsure.
- Each day dig down an equal amount on each side.
- Keep a careful watch on the sun and make sure you can get back up in good time.
- Build one or two tiny emergency survival shelters leading off the side of the staircase in case you mess up (at least 4 blocks away from the staircase, but can be just 2 high by 1 wide).
- Dig only a one-block wide staircase (to prevent spiders spawning or entering your staircase).
- Wall-off both of the top entrances to the staircase, and leave sand pillars behind you along both 'legs' of the staircase at intervals to stop anything sneaking up behind you (but be prepared to remove them quickly if a mob comes from in front of you. Leave these walls and pillars there from day to day. Just destroy and then replace them as you move through.
- Once you've cleared the sand on both 'legs', you need to mine 312 blocks of sandstone (52×3×2). By hand, at 4 sec per block requires a minimum of 1248 sec, around 25 minutes. Expect to use up several full days on the project.
- Once you are finished, remove all the pillars and open up the walls. Then, entice a creeper to chase you down the staircase. At the bottom, turn around and provoke the creeper into blowing up right at the bottom, on the exposed stone. Timing is everything.
- Repeat indefinitely, until you have mined all the cobblestone you need, or all the cobblestone in the world, or (more likely) died due to a timing error.

#### Single staircase
Twice as fast as the above method, but riskier. As above except:

- You need to mine 156 blocks of sandstone (52×3). By hand, that requires a minimum of 624 sec, around 10-11 minutes. Expect it take at least a couple of days.
- When you get to the bottom, build a mob-proof chamber (at least 4 back from the bottom of the staircase, with at least a 2 block straight drop, and with space to hide from ranged attacks).
- Draw creepers down the staircase from outside, but be sure to be secure in your shelter before they get to the bottom.
- You probably need to partly rebuild your bottom shelter after each explosion.

#### Shaft
Three times as fast as the single staircase, but possibly more dangerous and requires more patience.

- You need to mine 52 blocks of sandstone, 208 sec, about 3.5 minutes. Possible to do in one day if you are efficient and focused.
- Build a small surface shelter to prevent mobs from entering, with a 1×1 skylight.
- Bring a huge stack of sand.
- Inside the surface shelter, dig straight down beneath the skylight, watching the sun.
- Each day when you need to get back, pillar jump back up the shaft using the stack of sand. Time this operation so you get used to how long it takes.
- Once you reach the bottom, create a mob-proof shelter as per the single staircase.
- Then create an open passage running away from you, of at least 24 long × 1 wide × 2 high and wait for creepers to spawn.
- Drawing creepers down the shaft is not possible, you just have to wait for them to spawn, and deal with everything else that spawns.

Digging straight down is normally a terrible idea, but in a Superflat world it's (probably?) safe. As long as you don't forget your sand stack!
However, the need to dig the 24 block long passage for spawning more or less completely negates the advantage of the shaft over the single staircase method.

You can also use the Shaft method to dig illumination shafts into your staircase once it starts disappearing a long way under the sandstone. However, don't do this until you are deep enough that the fall is certain to kill any mobs that fall down the shaft. Also, don't forget your big sand stack, just in case you make a mistake and fail to connect with your staircase, meaning you can't walk out, you must pillar-jump out.

#### Explosive digging assistance
As noted above, while tediously digging down through the sandstone, you can persuade creepers to help you by exploding. As a bonus, they convert the destroyed sandstone to collectible items (useful for building your bottom shelter perhaps). However, it's debatable whether this is worthwhile, as it increases the risk of being killed by a creeper for not much gain. The creeper destroys a wide area outside your 1 block wide staircase (or shaft), so the useful work is only probably 3-4 extra blocks. You must also rebuild or reshape your staircase, so overall possibly not worth it unless you are extremely confident with safely triggering creepers.
