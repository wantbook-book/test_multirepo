#### Using spawn-setting items in the wrong dimensions
Beds in the Nether or the End explode upon attempting to use them. Respawn anchors safely create spawn points in the Nether, but when fully charged explode upon use in other dimensions. There is no way to set a spawn point in The End; one may set their spawn near a portal with a bed.

#### Bed obstruction
Normally, when the player sleeps, they wake up next to their bed if the space around it is not taken. It is important to leave a clear area around and above their bed. If there is not free space next to and/or above the player's bed, they may wake up inside a block and begin to suffocate. If this happens, remove the block quickly to avoid death by suffocation. If the player is killed, they cannot respawn at their bed; instead, they spawn instead at the world spawn, which can be far away from where the player was trying to sleep, along with a message saying, "You have no home bed or respawn anchor, or it was obstructed"‌[Java Edition  only], or "Your home bed was missing or obstructed"‌[Bedrock Edition  only].

Also, avoid placing transparent blocks such as glass around their bed as the player cannot spawn on a transparent block after waking up.

#### Carrying dangerous or non-essential items in the hotbar
If the player is careless when using lava, this is a possible (albeit drastic) result.
Lava is a dangerous resource. The player should not keep lava in their hotbar unless they are about to use it. Death can result from accidental use of a lava bucket, as well as damage any builds in the immediate area. Apart from lava, having items in the hotbar which are either not essentials (like weapons or food) or in use consumes valuable space. Unless the player is going to throw them or has nowhere else in their inventory for the items to go, leaving these items there just clutters up the hotbar, setting the player up to waste time later.

#### Not bringing a water bucket
During adventures, have a bucket of water on the hotbar at all times if not in the Nether. In the case of an emergency, it can do the following:

- Extinguish fire
- Solidify pools of lava to a walkable surface of obsidian
- Safely descend cliffs
- Allow the user to scale cliffs
- Repelendermenwithout aggravating them
- Kill melee mobs easily, as they are slower in water
- Be placed on the ground to break a fall
- Be placed on the ground, then used with a fishing rod, to generate a mobile food source

Without a bucket of water, all these situations are made much more dangerous. 

#### Falling
Heights are dangerous, and jumping off a structure, especially without knowing how tall it is, can result in death. A risky method would be to place a water bucket just before the player lands; this is colloquially called water bucketing. It is much safer to descend mountains or cliffs by climbing down normally or even swimming down water. However, this strategy does not work in the Nether since water evaporates there, which can catch newer players by surprise. Make sure to be especially careful on Amplified worlds, which are vertical, as even netherite armor with Protection and Feather Falling may not reduce enough damage to survive enormous falls. Death at the bottom may make it impossible to reach the items scattered everywhere. Riding off of a cliff in a boat can also negate fall damage, although due to a bug in Java Edition, there are a few specific heights where this fails.[1]

#### Arrows
If an arrow is shot directly upward, it may fall back down to hit the player. Also, the player should not charge at a target immediately after firing an arrow at them, especially if the player is wearing elytra, as they may collide with the arrow. Death from this method is highly unlikely unless done intentionally.

#### Fire
Fire can spread a long distance.
While not as dangerous as lava, fire is still quite hazardous due to its item-destroying abilities. In addition, it spreads every few seconds and can travel across trees. Luckily, it can be toggled in the world settings. Fire is especially dangerous in dark forest and jungle biomes because the trees are larger (so burn longer) and closer together, and if too many trees burn up at the same time it can heavily affect the game performance. If trying to clear the forest, it is advised to be careful with the fire and have a quick means of escape such as elytra or a Fire Resistance potion. Once the random tick speed gets high enough, fire may burn so fast that it does not render, so the player may end up on fire without seeing anything.

If the player wishes to create a fireplace in a building (for decoration, lighting, or disposing of unwanted items), make sure that the area under and surrounding the fire, as well as the four blocks above it, are made of non-flammable material, or use campfires to make it in a compact wood-themed building.

#### Riptide-enchanted tridents
A trident enchanted with Riptide is both a weapon and a means of quick air travel. If the player carelessly launches themselves into the air with Riptide, they can put themselves at risk of serious fall damage and death. The player should be careful not to launch themselves into dangerous situations. Using elytra or a potion of Slow Falling is recommended to prevent accidental death. While it is raining, the player can essentially use Riptide to fly through the air. However, due to its fairly long charge-up time, the player may accidentally fall a long distance if they do not use the trident fast enough, or if it suddenly stops raining.
