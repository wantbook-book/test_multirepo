#### Door Explore
Make piston doors with multiple keys. One idea is to make an End Portal Frame with a redstone comparator next to it, that must be activated with a hidden eye of ender. Another option is to make a combination lock. You could also make one where the player must rename a stick to the correct name (hidden on a secret sign!) and put it in a hopper chest, powering a comparator for the door.

#### 
Make something like Indiana Jones-ing. Put attractive blocks such as diamond/gold stuck to a wall. When the player touches it -pressure plate/tripwire etc. etc.- the block would come to the other side and the player would fall into something dangerous of your choice, such as lava, the void, or the End.
You could also make an observer system to detect when the block is broken. For instance, there could be sand placed above the object of value. When this object is broken, the sand falls down, and an observer get triggered as the block falls down. This could lead not the object of value, but the whole player into the aforementioned sources of danger. (totally didnt copy mumbo jumbo on that one) (you did totally copied mumbo jumbo)

#### Indiana Jones-ing... again...
Now that dispensers can face upwards, fill them with arrows and put a pressure plate or tripwire on top for an instant semi-hidden trap.

#### Indiana Jones-ing... a third time...
Put attractive blocks such as diamond/gold on a pedestal. 13 blocks below, place a piston that fires every so often (1 second is good.) Because pistons can push a maximum of 12 blocks, nothing will happen until the player takes the block, because the piston will extend if they don't put another block (like sand) in its place. Connect the piston to a BUD switch to activate some traps and hope the players remember to grab their hat!



#### Indiana Jones-ing 4th time
Put 2 Lines of ladder over a big drop! 
You will have to climb over it

#### Falling Floors
To make your level exciting, arrange a floor of TNT, with gravel on top. Then add a pressure plate on the gravel, so when you step on it, it disintegrates. Make some parts of the floor not fall (replace TNT with any other block), or a fail would render the level unplayable.

#### Button Brain Mash
Use buttons, or possibly comparatored item frames, for a simple combination lock.

#### Minecart Mania
Make a huge underground minecart roller coaster and give them a bow. Add some hard to shoot wood buttons. The aim is to shoot all the buttons and get them all to activate, turning on an And gate that changes the track to the next room.

#### The danger chests
First, fill the first trapped chest with useful loot and then place a block underneath the chest and then TNT. Then place a second trapped chest 2 blocks away from the first chest and place a block then a dispenser with flint and steel and then minecart with TNT underneath. Then place a regular chest 2 blocks away from the chest. Then fill it with useful loot. Add signs next to the chests like: Armor/food/swords/reward inside!

#### The ender puzzle
The End can be tough due to the dragon and endermen. If you want to make a course, then direct it the finish portal and add a huge reward at the end. Add something that really helps them in the game like the Strength V, full diamond enchanted armor, a stack of enchanted golden apples, Resistance II, an enchanted bow with arrows, to buy stuff they get 5 stacks of the stuff they need to use to buy and an extra reward for players, they get to keep their inventory! Kill the dragon first or you get spammed.

#### Invisibility Cloak
Make a long room (made of bedrock or obsidian) filled with creepers. In the beginning, make a chest with a 3:00 minute Invisibility potion. The player must reach the exit in time, or have all the creepers explode on the player.

#### Cake Shaft
Give a few really strong hunger potions to each player. Make a huge vertical shaft of cake. The aim is that the players must drink potion and eat the cake to go down to the next brain teaser. Optionally, to make this into a challenge, add lava coming down on them so they have to eat the cake quickly!

#### Splitup path
This divides your players into smaller groups and make 2 doorways and place iron doors at the front. Then place pressure plates next to them. Make a different route from each other. Make sure all of them direct to the same finish line.
Alternatively, you could make it that only one of the paths wins, and the other players will be turned into some fresh cooked meat by some lava. The surviving player is the "winner".

#### 
This is similar to the other one except add some curves to make it trickier and holes and blocks that crush you. Make a command block that affects you with speed III. Otherwise, this puzzle will be unwinnable.

#### Fake trap
Put pressure plates around a diamond block or chest, or make it look like there's redstone coming from a trapped chest. The player may think this is a trap, and may decide to quit the map.
