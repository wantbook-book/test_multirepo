#### Terrain
Because falling into the void kills you and destroys your gear, you should stay as close to the center of the island as possible, or at least inside the circle of towers. If you get knocked off, you should immediately throw an ender pearl back up. If you are quick enough, and have aimed your shot correctly, it is possible to teleport out of the void and back onto the surface.

#### Backups
It is recommended to bring backups with you, because they can deal with the endermen while you are taking on the dragon. They may also clear the area in the middle of the island so that you have more space to move around. Snow golems or iron golems make the best backup because they have stronger and more effective attacks than tamed wolves. The only difference between the two is that iron golems actually attack the endermen, while snow golems merely chase them away. Bring enough materials to spawn at least five golems.

Until you have spawned your golems, you should wear a carved pumpkin to avoid the endermen. The best time to spawn them is when the dragon is resting on its perch, when it does not attack you or your golems. You should also spawn them to the sides, in case it releases the dragon's breath.

After the reinforcements are spawned, reorganize your inventory so that your hotbar contains the following:

- Sword
- Bow or crossbow
- Pickaxe
- Golden apples
- A slow falling potion
- Ender pearls
- Blocks (a full stack)
- Food (a full stack)
- Empty bottles

As soon as your inventory is organized properly, quickly take off the pumpkin mask and put on your helmet. Now the showdown with the dragon begins.

### Destroying the end crystals
Destroying the end crystals is a key part of the battle, because they heal the dragon. With all of the crystals active, the dragon recovers faster than you could ever hope to damage it under normal conditions. It is possible to defeat the dragon while some crystals remain, provided the dragon spends enough time away from them, but it is best to destroy all of them. One end crystal sits atop each obsidian pillar. There are usually eight to ten towers of different heights arranged in a circle around the empty exit portal. The crystals on the tallest towers may be difficult to see, but the healing beam they emit when the dragon is nearby reveals their locations. Try to destroy a crystal while it is healing the dragon because the dragon takes 10 damage if you do this.

#### Shooting
The easiest way to destroy the crystals is to shoot them with your bow or crossbow. You should move so that you can see it at least partially, aim your shot just above the crystal from your view, and adjust your aim if needed. When destroyed, the crystal generates a massive explosion. If you cannot see the explosion, you can listen for the explosion sound. You should always shoot the crystals on the shortest towers because they are the easiest to shoot, and if you are using a crossbow you should check how many arrows they have after every shot.

Again, if you are playing on Java Edition, F3 + B can help you clearly see the bounding boxes of the end crystals, as well as that of your arrows. The hitboxes of crystals are quite a bit larger than their models, meaning you can see their hitboxes at angles where you normally cannot see their models. Being able to clearly see where your arrows landed is also a huge advantage, since you can stand still and adjust your shots, based on the landing sites of previous shots. Always keep your attention on the dragon though, since a charge attack or a dragon fireball can catch you off guard!

#### Climbing
Attempting to climb to the tops of the towers is extremely dangerous. Even if you build up using a dragon-proof material, such as end stone, the dragon can easily knock you off while you are climbing. Because of this, it is not recommended to climb the towers until the dragon is perched and you have drunk another slow falling potion. However, it is necessary to get up to the top of the caged towers somehow, because shooting them from the ground is ineffective unless you have the skill to find the gap between the obsidian and iron bars. If you choose to use the method of pillaring up with blocks, place water below so that in the event of you getting knocked off the platform, you can land safely in the water. Additionally, if you use water, and you have brought a Riptide trident, launch yourself into the air and land on the tops of the towers. However, this technique may be unreliable.

It is quicker and safer to use ender pearls than building up. One trick to measure your ender pearl shot is to fully charge your bow or crossbow and shoot an arrow just over the top edge of the cage. Throwing an ender pearl at the exact same angle can strike one block below the arrow's trajectory, teleporting you to the side of the cage. Break into the cage with your pickaxe, and wait for the dragon to fly away, since it cannot break the iron bars. If you have strong enough armor (ideally with Blast Protection) and are affected by Absorption, hit the caged crystal with your sword. Otherwise, build a safety platform few blocks away from the crystal and shoot it with your bow or crossbow. Alternatively, you can use TNT to destroy the crystals with no need to break through the iron bars at all â€” simply place one piece of TNT on top of the cage, light it with a flint and steel or a button, and then ender pearl back down (or retreat to the safety platform if you built one).

Once the caged crystal has been destroyed, don't go back down if you are still on the tower, because some towers are taller than the caged ones. Build a few blocks above the caged tower and shoot the taller ones with your bow or crossbow. If the dragon knocks you off, and you are not affected by Slow Falling, you should use an ender pearl to break your fall if you didn't start with water. Throw a pearl back to the top of the caged tower and try to shoot the taller ones again. You could also throw a pearl to the tops of the tall towers and destroy the crystals with your sword. If you are on the tallest tower, you can check how many crystals have been destroyed and how many remain. It is also a good spot to snipe the dragon.
