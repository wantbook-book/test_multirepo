# Tutorials/Defeating a monument
Ocean monuments are dangerous for unprepared players, as they have many dangers, including guardians, elder guardians, and many rooms that are easy to get lost in. However, they provide a treasure of eight blocks of gold, are the only sustainable source of sea lanterns and prismarine variants, as well as the only place where sponges can be obtained.

## Dangers
The most common mob within the monument are guardians. They swim quickly, have 30 × 15 health, and have two ways to damage the player:

- A laser is their primary offensive attack. It takes several seconds to charge, emitting a distinctive sound and changing color from purple to yellow in the process, and does 4points of damage when the charging completes.
	- This attack deals magic damage, meaning it ignores the target'sArmorstat.  However, theProtectionenchantmentcan still be used to reduce incoming damage.  Its magic-based properties also allow the laser to bypass players blocking with aShield, but the damage dealt to the target is cut in half.
	- There is no way to dodge the laser when it fires, but there are ways to prevent the laser from firing entirely. The laser requires constant line-of-sight with the target in order to charge. This means the guardian must cancel its attack if its target moves behind a wall or pillar, even for a split second. Circling narrow pillars can be used to circumvent multiple attacks from all sides.
	- The laser has a maximum range of about 15 blocks. If you can get far enough away before the charging completes, the attack is cancelled and deals no damage.
	- Guardians cannot move while charging their lasers. This can be used to your advantage if you are able to get within melee range of the guardian. If the guardian's target gets too close, then it attempts to create more distance between itself and the target by swimming away, but this also forces the guardian to stop charging.
- Guardians also have a naturalThorns-like defense. If attacked while their orange spikes are extended, the attacker takes 2damage. This damaged is only applied if the guardian is attacked with melee damage. The spikes usually extend when attacking with a laser and retract when swimming to a new location.

Each monument also contains three elder guardians. They have 80 × 40 health and a somewhat stronger laser attack which deals 8 points of damage, but move slowly and infrequently. They also inflict any player within 50 blocks with Mining Fatigue III for 5 minutes. In Java Edition, the elder guardians check for nearby players to afflict every 60 seconds. In Bedrock Edition, they afflict players immediately without waiting, so if you try to defeat a monument in Bedrock Edition, you can count on being afflicted with Mining Fatigue 100% of the time until all three elder guardians are killed. Bringing a cow into or near the monument and several Buckets is also a viable strategy, giving you roughly 55 seconds of normal mining if you drink a Bucket of Milk to cleanse the curse every time. This only works in Java Edition. If you do a "dry-run" of raiding the monument, aka without Water Breathing, this is a decent approach.

Under the Mining Fatigue effect, you take about 370 times longer to break blocks and your attack speed is reduced by 30%. When an elder guardian inflicts you with Mining Fatigue III, then you could drink a bucket of milk. However, drinking milk also removes Water Breathing, and you just get Mining Fatigue soon afterward (immediately in Bedrock edition) anyway. Wait until you have defeated all 3 elder guardians before drinking milk. Until then, simply avoid breaking blocks, and travel only through pre-made passages. If you must place blocks, such as in the case where you need to run around a pillar to break line of sight with the guardians, use decorated pots, slime blocks, honey blocks or TNT. These blocks are breakable instantaneously even under the effect of Mining Fatigue. There are still ways to brute-force your way into a monument, which is covered later.

Be sure to kill the elders in a manner that counts as a player kill so that they drop wet sponges, which can be smelted in a furnace or placed in the Nether to make dry sponges. A dry sponge, strategically placed, is a quick way to clear out a large volume of water.
