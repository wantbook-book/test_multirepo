# Tutorials/Underwater home
An undersea home has certain pros and cons that set it apart from any other sort of base. An underwater home is immune to explosions, most mobs have difficulty attacking it, and it provides a high level of protection and concealment. Additionally, the base can have access to conduit power. The difficulties with an undersea build in survival mode are that it presents challenges of reduced movement and mining speed, breathing while working, clearing water from the structures, and special measures for entry and exit on deep bases. Also be wary of drowned, as they are fairly common in oceans and sometimes have tridents, which can be dangerous.

## Moving underwater
Movement and mining speed underwater can be improved by the player equipping a helmet enchanted with the Aqua Affinity, which increases underwater mining speed, with a maximum tier of 1, and Depth Strider, which increases underwater movement speed, the maximum tier being 3.

## Breathing underwater
Building underwater is safer and simpler while wearing a helmet enchanted with Respiration and having some 8 minute Potion of Water Breathings ready to drink. Note that Respiration extends ones "breath holding" time only, it does not give true underwater breathing. Although they do not give one enough time for work, even 3 minute potions are useful in getting down to a deep base where you have other means to keep breathing.

A dried sponge is an excellent way to remove a large volume of water from an enclosed volume. A conduit can also completely solve the problem of breathing. A sponge or conduit can be difficult or time-consuming to obtain in survival mode, however.

For extended work periods, a player needs air bubbles close by in which the breath meter can be refilled. The bubble column from a magma block recharges your air supply, but be careful that the downcurrent does not suck you down into the magma block.

Blocks that displace water source blocks‌[Java Edition  only] to form air pockets to replenish air supply.
Examples of waterlogged blocks that don't displace water source blocks.
### Java Edition
Before the Update Aquatic (version 1.13), it was possible to make air bubbles with fence posts, signs, glass panes, iron fencing, ladders and stairs as these blocks did not fill their volume completely, and would drive out water when placed. With the Update Aquatic, only doors, fence gates, and banners still have these properties.

Doors and banners are the best options for making a breathing space as they can be placed on top of any block, even without walls on each side, and provide the needed head high air space. A gate needs to be placed against a head high vertical block, or be stacked up from the bottom to work. Only the upper half of a banner makes an air bubble so when placed on a wall it must be set head high.

### Bedrock Edition
In Bedrock Edition, all blocks are subject to waterlogging, meaning there are no blocks you can use to displace water source blocks to create an air space. Doors, ladders, and gates can be used to displace running water only.

To make an air pocket in Bedrock Edition, place a solid block that can break quickly, like a slime block or TNT. After breaking the block, quickly place a block that displaces flowing water, like a button, sign, or trapdoor, before a water source block forms in that space. The block where you place the sign is counted as a flowing water block, so a sign can create an air pocket there.

## Getting to the sea bottom
In relatively shallow waters you can just swim down and place "bubble blocks" to create a place to stand. From that you can place blocks out into the water to make walls and then a ceiling, then use a method of clearing water to finish the room. 

The "lily pad" method creates a 3×3 column to the bottom by dropping sand off the four edges of a lily pad from a boat on the surface. Alternatively, you can place a block onto the lily pad to make it easier to place the sand. Once you have an enclosed 1 block column of water you fill the central block with more sand, then work your way down from the top digging out the central column of sand and replace at least one of the sides with a non-falling block, like dirt or wool, and place ladder blocks on the non-falling block. When you reach the bottom you can dig out through the solid wall and place a door to keep the water out. Or you can dig down further into the seabed to make your base partially or completely underground.

A relatively risk-free method of getting down to the sea bottom is to dig down from a nearby landmass and then dig out horizontally until you are at the desired coordinates, based on previously rowing a boat out to your planned base location to note the coordinates.

## Building the base
If your base is big you must take out the water with a command block; however, if your base is small you can soak the water with a sponge to do it quickly. Once you have a safe place on the bottom you can start construction by placing a door just before a vertical wall then digging into the rock through the door. It is common for the sea bed to be gravel for 2-3 blocks so you should place a layer of solid blocks over top of the gravel to hold the water back as you remove the gravel. Once you have an entrance passage, you can place ladders, signs,(pre-Aquatic versions) or another door, banner, or gate (all versions) inside the first door, then remove it to make a flush entrance. You can even turn around to work backward out into the water to continue your base that way.

For an inconspicuous entrance, you can dig a 1×1 shaft down from your safe air bubble until you hit solid rock, then build further however you like. Avoid the risk of falling into a cave by standing on the border of two blocks as you dig first left then right on your way down.

flood control measure
To prevent flooding in the event of disaster dig down a block from floor level before digging horizontally. If your block(s) holding back the water are somehow broken, the inflowing water drops into the hole and stop there.

Another measure to prevent flood damage is to use light sources that water cannot wash away, like jack o'lanterns, glowstone, or sea lanterns. Torches of course would be washed away if water ever flooded in; however, Underwater torches can be used aside from the given items. 

Another useful measure to take is to construct an airlock at every door and to make windows double thick.
