### Large farms
Most of the above farms can be tiled to make larger farms, though in some cases, alternate rows or columns of the plots should be flipped for best results. This farm represents an expansion of design A (turned sideways), with the left column of plots reversed (it also shows the farmland border for the whole farm). The basic plots could be repeated further, expanding the farm in units of 9×9. Note that this design aims to make sure that each fruit occupies only one stem — as it increases in size, the efficiency approaches 49%.



### Multi-level farms
While the above designs all use one layer, the most efficient (49.38%) 9×9 farm can be created by using two layers. Design is based on design D, and cobblestone indicates spaces that are covered (with dirt) by the layer above.

When replicated over a larger area, design G has spots where you need to jump. Design H avoids that but keeps the same efficiency. For design H, the water source must be placed with care so that it won't spread into the "corridors". However, if there is the usual pit in the bottom layer (and matching hole above), the source block can be placed against one of the upper blocks, or 2 blocks above that layer. The position of the melon stems and dirt/grass/farmland blocks in the two farming layers can be swapped without losing efficiency.

### Rapid-harvest farms
The above layouts are optimized for high spacial efficiency, at the cost of speed. They work best for infrequent harvests, with plenty of time for the field to regrow in between. For frequent harvests, the first following layout may be better suited; if harvested once per day-and-night cycle, it yields about 17 fruits per harvest (as opposed to about 13 fruits for the above designs). The second layout goes even further in that direction—it does not use space efficiently but instead gives each stem 2–4 potential places to spawn a pumpkin or melon, encouraging quicker initial growth at the cost of a clumsier design and reduced long-term yield.

## Semi automatic farms
Both melons and pumpkins are broken and dropped when a piston pushes into them. This mechanic can be used to create self harvesting farms. The simplests designs like this push sticky pistons upward into the fruit. Since it is difficult to automatically collect the items when harvested this way, the technique makes for some practical semi automatic designs.

Top layer
This design uses sticky pistons to push the block the pumpkin or melon is sitting on upward. To save redstone, it is possible to waterlog slabs so that the redstone line can be underneath the water without being washed out.

### Stackable design
The following design sacrifices space efficiency in order to fully automate harvesting and allow massive expansion: The tower can be expanded up to the build limit and/or down to bedrock, potentially yielding nearly a thousand growing spaces per tower.

The total area of the farm is 13 blocks by 7 blocks, with an alternating piston and farm layers. Its height is 2 blocks, plus 2 more for each "crop layer" of 8 growing spaces. You need the following materials to make it: 

- 16 dirt
- 8 jack-o-lanterns, or glowstone (for lighting)
- 8 iron
- 28 Redstone + an extra 10 - 13
- At least 50 generic blocks per crop layer, an extra 43 blocks for the build as a whole.

The farmland is hydrated by water flowing down from above. A pressure plate at the end of the collection area on the bottom activates a Redstone torch tower, which in turn activates each piston layer. The harvest falls down the empty middle area into flowing water at the bottom layer and is channeled to the player standing on the pressure plate.

Starting tips:

- To speed up collection, place ice blocks under the watercourse.
- The farm can be lit from within by glowstone as shown, or much more cheaply by jack o'lanterns. Unfortunately, you can't place a jack-o-lantern directly onto a piston, so if you need to put temporary blocks in place of the pistons, put the jack-o-lanterns on top of those, and then replace the temporary blocks with the pistons.
- The pressure plate can be replaced with a hopper or two, leading to a chest or two south of it. Then, the Redstone can be triggered with a switch anywhere along its length. However, a sufficiently tall farm may produce enough goods to overwhelm the hopper (750 items—call it a dozen stacks—take 5 minutes to absorb, so additional stacks may expire. Twenty or so levels of melons could do that, or most of a hundred levels of pumpkins).

See the following steps to build the farm itself:

1. Start with the base layer, which is a modified farm layer. The farmland squares should be planted with your seeds, while the dirt is where pumpkins or melons grow.

- If you are using jack o'lanterns for light, remember the temporary blocks as noted above.

1. Place a piston layer on top of that. This completes your first crop layer, and for the bare-minimum "tower", you could go on to the cap and water layers from here. More likely, continue to:
2. Alternate farm and piston layers, as many as you want. Each pair is a crop layer. This is the expandable section, and you are limited only by resources.
3. After the last piston layer, build the cap layer instead of another farm layer. The black wool indicates temporary blocks (any solid, non-falling block) that you remove after placing the water on the top level.
4. Last of all, build the top layer, place the water, and mine out those temporary blocks. For the top-most layer, all the water blocks are sources (the Art of the Bucket can assist in filling them quickly).
