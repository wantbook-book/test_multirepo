### Breeding stock
You need to find two axolotls to start breeding. Axolotls spawn underwater lush caves, where there is clay on the bottom. When you see an axolotl, use a water bucket on it to capture it. The bucket must not be empty when you do this; it must contain water.

If you hold a bucket of tropical fish in your hand while hunting, an axolotl that you didn't see may start following you.

### Food supply and breeding
Hunt for tropical fish, using as many water buckets as you can carry.

In Java Edition, when you feed your axolotls to breed them, it is a good idea to hold one bucket of tropical fish in your off-hand to maintain the axolotls' attention. If not, as soon as you feed one, you are holding an empty bucket, causing the axolotls to lose interest and swim away until you switch to another bucket of fish. You cannot hold a bucket in your off-hand in Bedrock Edition.

With luck, you might get a blue axolotl before you have bred 1,200 non-blue ones.

## Natural generation farm
For axolotls to spawn, they require a water space in a lush cave in total darkness, with clay blocks within five blocks below the spawning space. These conditions can also be achieved in an player-built underground lush cave room filled with four or five layers of water. Additionally, Bedrock Edition requires the ceiling of the room to consist of opaque blocks.

If the spawning room is below level Y=30, the conditions that cause axolotls to spawn also cause glow squid to spawn. Because axolotls kill squid, you can arrange the farm so that the glow ink sacs dropped by the squid are swept into a collection chest. Or if you don't care about glow ink sacs, you can make the farm even simpler by ignoring them; the ink sacs disappear after 5 minutes.

The example farm described below is easy and quick to build in survival mode with common materials and stone tools. In fact, if you are interested in breeding a blue axolotl, it may be easier (and safer!) to build a simple farm to get your breeding stock, rather than hunting for axolotl in the wild.

### Location
Pick a location on in a lush caves biome. It doesn't have to be in an actual lush cave, just in the biome. You can repurpose a lush cave to a spawning room also.

The ceiling of your farm must be below layer 63 (sea level), as deep as you want, although prior to Bedrock Edition 1.18 the floor of the farm should not be below layer 0. The distance between the floor and ceiling should be at least 5 blocks (6 blocks is best, to give you breathing room).

### Example farm
The diagram below illustrates the concept. The spawning room area is 8×8, and 6 blocks high. The 8×8 dimensions were chosen because it requires only one hopper, but different room sizes and shapes are possible with a carefully planned arrangement of flowing water and hoppers. The hopper is needed only to collect glow ink sacs. If you don't care, then don't bother with the hopper.

The floor of the room should be clay because axolotls spawn only when clay is underneath the spawning space.

Water source blocks occupy the bottom four layers of the room. The fifth layer has a row of water source blocks on one side, and one more opposite the hopper, to create a water flow that pushes items toward the hopper. It can be tedious to get this top layer of water flowing properly, because water on top of water does not spread like water on a solid surface. Place easily-breakable blocks like slime blocks or dirt under the end of the flow to force it to spread, then break the block and repeat until the water is fully spread out. It helps to have a Respiration effect active while doing this.

The hopper should be two blocks below the flowing water (one block below the top-most water source block). Placing the hopper just below the flowing water layer (which would be normal for water flowing on top of a solid surface instead of on top of more water) risks items getting trapped under the hopper. Place a button or sign on one wall above the hopper to prevent water from flowing in. Then, when an item is pushed into the corner by the flowing water, it falls one block down into the hopper.

If you don't care about collecting ink sacs, you don't need the hopper or flowing water, and the farm becomes trivially quick to build. Just make the room six blocks high and fill it with five layers of water, leaving the top layer as air for you to breathe and place temporary torches for lighting during construction.
