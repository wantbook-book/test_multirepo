## General
By the third day, the player should have a basic shelter and basic resources, though you probably don't have enough resources to last for a long time just yet. Now it's time to gather more resources and/or improve the house. If you're adventurous, you can also go find caves, dungeons, strongholds and/or mineshafts to fight monsters and/or find ores, which will both be very useful for various reasons. If you don't feel safe encountering caves and similar structures just yet, the player can just explore in the Overworld and look for villages and temples, as they contain various loot. Try to make a few various farms, and use some redstone.

Note: Since Minecraft is a very open and often personal game, each player should decide what to do for themselves. Many gameplay methods exist at this point of your adventure, so you can try doing different things and look for your favorite activity.

### Tips to the full Minecraft experience
If you are still looking for a common path to follow, start crafting more materials. Use the advancements list or the list below as goals to help you progress, ensuring that you also take breaks to enjoy the sandbox!

- Start a farm of some type to always have food and other materials on hand, such as awheat farm.
- Start a mine down to the bedrock, create a mineshaft if possible, and stockpile ores.
- Craft abook and quillto jot down important coordinates and keep it on you as an alternative to maps. Some players use text files in their PCs in place of this.
- Make a mob trap and get resources (gunpowder,string,arrows, etc.)
- Return to your home and further expand it and craft new items.
- If you go mining and see lava, gather it with an empty bucket:
	- Lava buckets are a very good fuel source â€“ they can smelt over 100 items per bucket. However, be sure to empty the furnace, as once 64 items are smelted and they are not removed, the furnace will still be using up the fuel but will not smelt anymore items. Just take the output stack and refill the input stack, and the furnace will continue until it runs out of fuel.  Later you can make hoppers to automate the flow of material.  This is especially useful if you are making smooth stones in quantity.
	- With care, lava can also be used to fend off monsters, flooding a hillside or filling a trench to burn them.  Try not to start forest fires!

These are the basic activities that you can do on your third day. Remember, don't do too much because you have very limited resources. Also, make sure to always stay close to your shelter.

## Gathering Resources
Resources are very important in Minecraft.  Resources include not just the blocks that make up the world, but also mob drops and farmable crops.  These let you build shelters and make food, tools, armor, and much more. Because of this, it's important to make sure that you never run out of resources. For materials that are rare and non-renewable, use them very sparingly, only when you absolutely need them. It's recommended to use common or renewable materials whenever possible. However, note that renewable materials are usually only renewable when a farm of that material is made, so don't use up all of any type of material in one area before you've made a farm of that material.

### Preparation Before Exploring
A suitable inventory for exploring in Survival mode, containing torches, a bed, tools, weapons, 2 pieces of iron armor, blocks, food, bow and arrows, and compass.
It is highly recommended to bring the following items before exploring:

- Abed: these reset your spawn point and skip the whole night without having to fend off monsters.  Sleeping also fends offphantomsfor three days.
- Weapons
- Ashield
- Iron armor: at least 1 piece, preferably thechestplate
- (Stone/Iron/Diamond)Pickaxe
- (Stone/Iron/Diamond)Shovel
- Cookedfood
- Torches:  Lighting up your house prevents monsters from spawning in your house, especially at nighttime.
- Place any unnecessary items in achest. Any items placed in a chest will not be lost if you die.
- [Optional]Clock: If you are in an underground shelter due to having no time to create a shelter with windows and doors, you can use a clock to see what time it is outside without opening a hole, risking a monster spotting you.
- [Optional]Compass: This tool can help you find your way back to thespawn point.
- [Optional]Map: This shows a top-down view of the area and can be more useful to find your way home than a compass.
- [Optional] Emptybucketor 2-4 milk buckets: Milk Buckets will help you negate any effects inflicted on you, which is extremely useful if you encounter a witch or a cave spider which gives you poison. For Beginners: to obtain milk buckets, just go up to a cow and use an empty bucket on it and the bucket will have milk in it; this milk can then be drunk to negate any status effects.
