You can much more easily collect all the logs if you farm multiple trees in a special shape.

- It does not matter if the birch trees are replaced by spruce or vice-versa.
- To collect it in this fashion simply do as below:

1. Chop all or most of the birch or spruce trees down to a stump and jump on each and every stump to collect the top logs.
2. Cut a two-high notch into one of the oaks, one block above where you currently are, and jump up into it.
3. Now you can either jump one higher into the jungle or another oak's trunk after collecting all the logs overhead.
4. Continue step 3 until you have harvested all the upper logs.
5. Get rid of the stumps or "pillars" you stood on.
6. Repeat all steps to content.

In EthosLab's LP episode 51, Etho has a tree farm with 24 trees growing side by side in a 7×7 square. The tree/dirt part looks like:



|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

The farm should be put above a flowing source of water to auto-collect the drops. In Etho's version, the farm is put in the middle of a 13×13 square,
and on each corner of the square is a water block. This takes all drops from the leaves to the center point of the setup, where you can place a hopper.

After setting up the farm, just put a sapling (oak, birch, or spruce) on every dirt block. If you want to plant 25 trees, you can put a dirt block in the dead center.




## Automatic tree farms
Although somewhat complex to build (as opposed to planting saplings and just waiting or applying bone meal and then manually chopping them down), these automatic tree farms allow you to harvest wood at a much faster rate by automating the gathering and block breaking portions of tree farming.

### 
Focusing only on the growth portion of the farm, these designs allow you to quickly grow hundreds of trees by pressing down a mouse button and then ignoring it. A dispenser with bone meal automatically forces the tree to grow, and a column of pistons pushs the trunk into a collection area where it is stacked in a large block for you to later 'mine'. The more complex designs also include leaf breaking, meaning that you end up with a net positive on the saplings and in the case of oak trees get apples without having to do much of anything.

After a few minutes you then go over to the storage area and mine out all the wood blocks in much the same way as you would cave-mine; meaning that you do not have to waste time by moving from one tree to the other.

## 1.14 TNT farms
As of update 1.14, it's possible to make a TNT based tree farm, or TNTree, with 100% drop rate for saplings, apples, sticks and logs.

### AFK tree farm designs
Several mobs in the game can break blocks, and most of them have been used for wood farming. An overly complex design featuring creepers was made, but the insane size of it makes constructing it anywhere exceptionally difficult. A different design that uses ghasts is also available and much simpler to make, however when ghasts break blocks they destroy (without dropping) most of them, making tree farming with the ghast extremely inefficient.

The wither makes it possible to auto-break blocks by using the wither's ability to break any blocks within a 3×3×4 area (4×6×4 on bedrock edition) of it one second after it has been damaged. The wither can be trapped in bedrock in any of the dimensions. Because of the larger breaking area on Bedrock Edition, you can grow oak, birch, jungle, acacia, spruce, and even dark oak (by using boats to shift the breaking area) inside the breaking area of the wither.




A newer method of caging in the wither has also been found that enables a tree farm to be build anywhere while at the same time using the wither to break the wood blocks. Although potentially more dangerous than encasing the Wither in bedrock (as in the above design), this cage has been found to be completely reliable as long as it is built correctly. It works by distracting each head with mobs without them being able to damage those mobs.




#### AFK-able universal tree farms
These tree farms work with all tree types except for dark oak. The only reason it does not work with dark oak is because they have a 2×2 block trunk. The section below covers those.




#### Automatic dark oak tree farms
These are nearly non-existent because dark oak trees grow with a 2×2 trunk and have extremely specific growth restrictions. The most well-known design of a dark oak tree farm is by ShaydeeJay, which produces 21000-36000 logs per hour.
