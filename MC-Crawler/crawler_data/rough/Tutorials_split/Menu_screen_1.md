### Multiplayer
Multiplayer Screen with 2 servers
The Multiplayer button, found below the Singleplayer button, takes you to the Multiplayer Menu which lets you join servers with other players, whether online or nearby. It appears with a list of known servers which you may connect to. When you first log in, the message "Scanning for games on your local network" will appear, meaning it is scanning for nearby servers which have been opened to LAN via the Pause Menu. You will also find several buttons on the bottom of the interface.

### Minecraft Realms
Main article: Realms
The "Homepage" of Realms
The third button on the main menu is labeled Minecraft Realms. This button will take you to the "Homepage" of Realms. Here you can perform all of the basic actions associated with Realms, which are as follows:

- See all of the Realms you own / are invited to and information about them
- Play on a Realm
- Buy a new Realm
- Configure your own Realm(s)
- Leave a Realm
- See new invitations
- Find out more about Realms

The majority of these functions can be carried out by clicking on a Realm and using the button group at the bottom of the screen. Invitations can be accessed via the envelope next to the Realms logo. The What is Realms? link in the upper right hand corner takes you to the Realms website where you can learn more about the program.

There is a distinct difference between the server list in the Multiplayer screen and the Realms list. Here you can see all of the basic information about the Realm you may need. The exact layout is shown here:

#### Invitations

Invitations can be accepted or declined via the envelope next to the Realms logo. If you have an invitation, you will see a little number dancing on the envelope. If the little number is instead a !!!, then it means that you have more than five invitations.


If you hover over the envelope, a tooltip will appear. It will either say No pending invitations! or Pending invitations! If you click on this when you have some invitations, it will take you to a screen where you can accept or decline various invites.



The example as shown at the right is a list of any and all Realms you have been invited to. The operations here are simple: You simply click on an item and you can either accept the invitation or decline it.

Once you have been invited to a Realm and accepted it the Realm will appear on your Realm list. At any time you can click on that Realm and click the Leave Realm button, which will uninvite you from that Realm until such time as you are invited again.

If you decline an invite your name is taken back off the invited list of that Realm, but keep in mind that the owner can re-invite you at any time. If you are getting spammed with an invite from a particular person and you don't want to see them again, email the support address and they may be able to help.
