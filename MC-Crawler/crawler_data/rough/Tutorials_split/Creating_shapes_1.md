## 2-dimensional shapes
These 2-dimensional shapes have only length and height, or only length and width. Most 3-dimensional shapes are based on one or more 2-dimensional shapes.

Note: Each of these demonstrations for the shapes only shows how the perimeter of the shape should look. If you would like, you can fill the center of the shape in. Also, remember that for the grids, the shapes will look wider than they really are.

### Right Triangle
Right triangles are perhaps the easiest triangle to make, because of the fact that two of their sides are straight lines, going either vertical or horizontal. Only one side is diagonal. The following grids show how to make a right triangle with a 4 block base and height, and one with a 9 block base and height.

#### Right triangle extensions
You can make right triangles with different bases and heights, but they are harder to make, because they don't use an exact line for the diagonal side. The right triangle shown before is for a 45-degree diagonal side.

For a diagonal side with a 65 to 70 degree angle, repeatedly place 2 blocks upwards for the diagonal line, before going towards the vertical line, like so:

|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |

For a diagonal side with a 20 to 25 degree angle, repeatedly place 2 blocks horizontally for the diagonal line, before going towards the vertical line, like so:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

For angles in between 25 and 45, and angles between 45 and 65, you must use combinations of patterns from both of the slopes that the angle is in between. (see Angled lines above)

This is a picture of the comparison between equilateral and right triangles in Minecraft. Both have a height and base of 9 blocks.
### Equilateral Triangle
Equilateral triangles are a little bit more abstract than right triangles, but they still have a clear way to build them. First, build a line of blocks however long you want your triangle to be. Then, build one block up on the edges of the lines. Continue by building in sets of 2 blocks up, going 1 block inwards each time. Look at the following grids for examples:

Notice how the triangles look more triangular the bigger they are.  

Triangles made in this way have angles of 63 degrees at the base and 54 degrees at the top, and the sides will be about 10% longer than the base. A true equilateral triangle has equal sides with angles of 60 degrees, which can be approximated using the "angled lines" char above as a 30-degree angle from the perpendicular or vertical.  This could be approximated by doing a 1-block segment every (alternately) two and three 2-block segments, but this may end up looking uneven, and the difference will only be apparent for fairly large triangles. A perfectly equilateral triangle is possible if it is not orthogonal to any of the coordinate axes, but rather orthogonal to the space diagonal of a block.
