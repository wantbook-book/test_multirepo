#### Specialty roads
Clay road:
Recommended material:Clayorterracotta.
Make a road that is 3-7 blocks wide, keeping turns and slopes at a minimum. If you must go over a hill, gently slope the road withstone slabs. If the incline you encounter is more than 1 block up for every 5 to 7 blocks horizontally, use stonebrick stairsor change to a similar type of road. The middle block use redstone. For an automatic lighting system connect adaylight sensorto aNOTgate, and then aredstone lamp. This road type can bridge moderate gullies, ponds, valleys, and small pits are good for rural areas and work well in flat areas. Decorative stone brick guardrails are acceptable.
Musical road:
Recommended material:Note block, woodenpressure plate.
This road type is actually a feature that can be applied to just about any moderately sized road. Dig out a 1 block wide trench along the middle or side of your road, and place note blocks (with the desired material underneath, seeNote Block) in this trench. Adjust the pitches as necessary, and fill in the spaces between note blocks in more complicated melodies. Lastly, place wooden pressure plates on top of the note blocks, and now it is possible to ride along the road and listen to music at the same time.
Unusual material:
Build your road out of an unusual block, such asoresorwood.
### General block palette
It is often advised that, for a specific type of construction, you stick to a specific palette of block-types, to make your city more organized. Example block palettes include:



- Medieval: Don't use materials which couldn't be easily obtained in a medieval world. For example, don't useconcreteorredstonemechanisms, and useglasssparingly. Different variants ofstoneandwoodare the best materials to use in construction.
- Rustic/Farm: Use almost allplanksandlogs, with small holes in the walls made withstairs, make rooms irregularly shaped with 1Ã—1 windows (holes in the wall).
- Skyscraper: Made withconcrete,quartz, oriron blockswith massive cyan or light blue glass windows,sea lanternsfor lighting.
- Futuristic: Use plenty ofquartzand glass blocks (basically anything white).
- Aquatic: Useprismarine, withglass blockwindows andspongesas decorations
- Nether: Usenether bricksdetailing like window boxing, and uselavaandmagma blocksfor lighting. Build walls withquartz,red nether bricks,nether wart blocks, etc. You can use obsidian as a foundation.
- End: Useend stone bricksandpurpur, withend rodsfor lighting andshulker boxesfor storage.

This helps other builders, and yourself, to make creations that "fit" together, instead of a random mix. It also helps the build stay consistent. However, following the palette isn't always necessary, as different-looking buildings can make your city look more varied and interesting.

### Jobs

  


Note: Most jobs can only be done in multiplayer because mobs do not have the required AI. So if you are in singleplayer, these ideas probably won't be useful, except for those that can be done (to a limited extent) by villagers.


Job Search Center: A place that helps those new to the server to find work. 

After you have built your city, you may want citizens to work. Here are some examples of jobs the citizens of your city can work.
