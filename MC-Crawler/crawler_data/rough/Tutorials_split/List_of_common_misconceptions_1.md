## Items
Myth: Leaves items with data values above 3 could be obtained in Alpha versions, according to their unofficial nickname, "alpha leaves".

- Leaves items with data values above 3are able to be created in release versions up to 1.4.5. The term "alpha leaves", which is commonly used to refer to these items, is an unaccountable misnomer.

Myth: Maps don't work in the Nether because they always show the bedrock ceiling. 

- Maps are intentionally programmed to show a red-gray static pattern in the Nether; it has nothing to do with the bedrock ceiling.
	- In fact, even if the bedrock ceiling is removed, or something is built on it‌[Java Edition  only], the map does not show these changes.

## Mobs
Myth: Mobs can summon the warden by causing vibrations to trigger sculk shriekers in the same way players can.

- It is not possible for other entities such as bats to summon thewarden. Only naturally-generatedsculk shriekersare triggered, and therefore summon the warden, in response to vibrations produced explicitly by the player. However, after being summoned, the warden attacks non-player mobs that make vibrations.

Myth: Rana existed at the same time Steve, Black Steve, and Beast Boy.

- TheDockmob Rana never co-existed with the other Dock mobs (Steve, Black Steve, Beast Boy). Rana was originally made as a test for md3 mobs, and was originally added inIndev 20091223-1. The aforementioned Steve mobs were added inIndev 20100129, replacing Rana, and then removed inIndev 20100131.

Myth: Glow squids were originally meant to hypnotize players that got too close.

- Theglow squidwas never meant to hypnotize players; this was just a joke for its mob vote video.

Myth: Zombified piglins that appear near nether portals in the Overworld came through from the Nether.

- These zombified piglins actually spawnedinsidethe nether portal, and did not come through from the Nether.
	- To prove the point, the player can create a nether portal that links to a biome in the Nether that doesn't spawn zombified piglins (e.g. asoul sand valley), and zombified piglins still appear near the portal on the Overworld side.

Myth: Eggs and snowballs do damage to the ender dragon.

- While this was true beforeJava Edition 1.9, it is no longer the case since then.

Myth: An enderman gets aggravated the instant you look into its eyes. 

- In fact, the player has to stare at the enderman's eye-level for 5game ticks(1⁄4second) for it to aggravate.
	- Therefore, simply glancing over endermen's eyes does not aggravate them.
	- Also, endermen freeze when they become aggravated due to being looked at. The player must look away from its eyes for it to begin attacking.

Myth: Creepers are completely silent before they start hissing.

- Creepers make footstep sounds like other walking mobs, it's just that they produce the same footstep sounds as the player, making it hard to distinguish the creeper's footsteps from that of the player's own.
	- However, the creeper's footstep sounds are controlled by a different volume slider than that of the player's. By turning down the "Players" volume and keeping the "Hostile Creatures" volume at maximum, the player can more easily hear a creeper that's approaching them.

Myth: illager patrols come from pillager outposts.

- Patrol spawning is completely unrelated to pillager outposts; it is a separate type of mob spawning unrelated to normal mob spawning.
- In comparison,pillagerspawning in outposts is similar to other structure spawns, such as guardians from ocean monuments, and witches from swamp huts.

Myth: To prevent phantoms from spawning, the player must sleep through the night.

- The player simply needs to sleepinthe bed for a brief moment to refresh their "Time Since Last Rest" statistic, and phantoms cannot spawn for another hour.
- If the player wants to stay up during the night without encountering phantoms, they simply need to enter a bed and exit it once every three in-game days, without needing to skip the night.

Myth: Ghasts are undead mobs.

- Despite their ghostly appearance, ghasts are not considered undead mobs. This means they can drown, are damaged byInstant Damageand healed byInstant Health, are affected byPoison, and are not affected bySmite.

## World
Myth: The Far Lands were originally the edge of the world.

- The Far Lands were not the edge of the Minecraft world, simply the edge of normal terrain. The actual edge of the world from Infdev all the way to Alpha 1.1.2_01, and the edge of solid land from Alpha 1.2.0 to Beta 1.7.3, was at 32 million blocks out. The absolute edge of world is 2147483647 in each direction withintdata type.

Myth: Brick pyramids were intended to be an early source of bricks.

- Brick pyramids were actually implemented as a way to test large structure like world features, not as an early way to obtain bricks. Entities did not work at all in the version brick pyramids were implemented in, and as such collecting bricks from these structures before entities were re-implemented inInfdev 20100316was completely impossible.
- Brick pyramidsexisted only betweenInfdev 20100227-1andInfdev 20100325.

Myth: Real-world azalea trees are related to oak trees. 

- Azalea treesare a real type of plant which is not closely related to oaks, not a fictional variant of oak.

Myth: Ice spikes is an entirely fictional biome. 

- Although the ice spikes biome is often thought of as a fictional or fantasy biome, the ice spikes are probably based on a real type of ice formation calledpenitenteswhich can form in large quantities in cold, dry locations and can grow to large sizes.

Myth: The modified jungle edge is the rarest biome in the game. 

- This is true only in Java Edition release versions 1.7 to 1.17.1 inclusive. The modified jungle edge biome, alongside a large number of other biomes, were removed from the game completely in 1.18.

Myth: The Nether is eight times smaller than the Overworld.

- The Nether is equally as large as the Overworld, both of which are surrounded by theworld border‌[JE  only]30 million blocks away from the world origin.
- The 1:8 distance conversion ratio is a feature of the game itself, not a side effect of the Nether's size.
