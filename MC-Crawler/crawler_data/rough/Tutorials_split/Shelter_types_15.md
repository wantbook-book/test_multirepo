## Extreme
These shelters offer the most amount of protection. Generally large and made out of obsidian combined with many add-ons.

### Bunker Alpha
Description

This is a very large bunker. It should have rooms for almost anything, and have enough space for many large building projects. It is dug almost down to bedrock so, if you build in the right area, there should be no danger of digging to the surface.

Necessary Materials

Lots of pickaxes, supplies for building traps (such as redstone, pistons, and tripwire), and torches.

Location

Anywhere that you can dig down easily from. It takes a long time to build, so you should have a pre-existing base.

Construction
First, dig a long hallway, with stairs going down 6-10 blocks every 30 blocks or so. Make the hallway big enough, so that lots of people can be in it at one time comfortably. Then, dig rooms off to the sides. If you did this correctly, there should be enough space for a couple of hundred rooms. Make rooms dedicated to various things, like an armory or forge. This base can hold lots of people and is hidden well, so feel free to build it in multiplayer.

Extras

- Traps along the hallway to kill intruders.
- Farms for almost everything.

### Ultimate Siege Fort
Description

This is basically a castle, only much, much bigger. Its walls are lined with obsidian so you don't have to worry about creepers.

Necessary Materials

A lot of cobblestone (About 100,000 to 1,000,000 blocks. So don't try to build this unless you have enough for a lifetime.)

About ⅓ as much obsidian to line the walls.

Location

Somewhere flat (it is recommended to practice this shelter on super-flat on creative mode).

Construction

To start it should take up an area of at least a 5×5 chunks. Make walls, they should be at least 7 blocks tall and 3 blocks thick, mine out the middle layer and replace it with obsidian and break the top layer (to prevent unwanted tunneling extend the obsidian layer about 15 blocks into the ground). Next, make the towers, they should be 50 to 250 blocks tall, They should be hollow, but don't forget to line the walls with obsidian. Then, make the roof. Remember it should be about 2/5 wider than the circumference of the tower. Add the spikes. If you've done it right then the towers should look like those of one of the castles you would see on TV. That's just about it, you now have your own ultimate siege fort. You can personalize it in any way you like. Don't forget to light it with torches or glowstone. 

Extras

- TNTcannons on the towers. (IMPORTANT!): If you want this feature only make the towers about 20 blocks tall to avoid the fuse range limit.

- A lava moat

- A draw bridge (if you decide to make a lava moat)

- Snow golemson the walls as guards. If you are good at trapping hostile mobs and only want to stop players from coming in, you could useskeletonsinstead! Note: Unless nametagged, skeletons will despawn after 5 minutes, or after you move a certain distance away.

- As an alternative to the above, if you're on anmultiplayerserver, you can have real players guard your ultimate siege fort.
	- You could pay real players by granting them weapons, and protection if needed.

### Obsidian base
Description

A large house made out of obsidian.

Necessary materials

- About 1,000,000 obsidian (don't do this if you don't have enough).
- 5000 buckets of lava

Location

Forest or jungle biome so the burning trees will increase the defense. Although, rather obviously, this might also be a bad thing, if you have enough materials for this thing, you should be able to survive.

Construction

Build a large skyscraper about 700×700 blocks wide. Use the leftovers for the walls. Add lava at the walls to kill mobs and to set the trees on fire. Add towers the same as the ones in the ultimate siege fort and add lava to the walls.

Extras

- A moat of pistons.
- Extra trees.

Pros

- Creepers cannot blow up the walls EVER.
- Extreme protection.

Cons

- Difficult to build.
- It will take more than 50 days to build
- It requires lots of obsidian to build.

## Super Extreme
These shelters provide nearly perfect protection. These structures are massive, and have large amounts of add-ons, not recommended for any players who are not willing to spend many days constructing these.

### The Obsidian City
The second hardest and most protective shelter in Minecraft.

Description

A city under one gigantic obsidian shelter.

Necessary Materials

- 10,000,000 blocks of obsidian
- 100,000 blocks of stone/cobblestone
- 25,000 blocks of wooden planks (oak or spruce)
- 5,000 fences/nether brick fence
- Some redstone (dust, torches, pistons, etc.)

Location

If you are able to clear all that land, then build it in a forest or tundra biome. Of course, these are only recommendations.

Construction

Mark out a plot of land at least 65×65 chunks. It does not necessarily have to be square. (The one the author built was a dome) Then, raise the walls with obsidian at least 30 blocks. Then, add a roof of obsidian. Now, you can add 5 more layers of obsidian. Once you have got that done, install a 5 block high piston-operated door made of obsidian at least 2 blocks thick. Line the inside of the giant obsidian shell with stone and wood. You can build lots of things inside there! Finally, add an obsidian 'fence' about 2 blocks thick around the gigantic structure and put actual fences on top. Make the gate piston operated. Just build whatever you like in there!

Extras

- A Mansion inside the structure!
- Lava/Water moat
- Secret entrance
- Dispenser turrets
- TNT cannons
- Garden outside the structure, enclosed by the obsidian fence. Adds some happiness to the bleak surroundings.
- Horse path

Pros and Cons

Pros

- Extreme levels of protection
- Looks good if designed properly
- If you live in this, you literally havezerofear of the outside world.
- You have lots of space to build inside and what's more, they are protected by 7+ layers of obsidian.

Cons

- Extremely hard to build
- Time consuming to build
- Easily spotted. However, this can also be a good thing as you can make it back to the base easily.
