### Retractable blast shields
These are an easy way to keep mobs at a distance, and are especially effective against mobs which use sight as a weapon, such as creepers and endermen, however it can be tough to collect the necessary resources for this mechanism. Say we're going to protect a window which is two blocks from the ground and four blocks wide. To start, count three blocks out from the window, and then dig a 6-block-wide, 3-block-deep, 3-block-thick (6×3×3) trench, and then line the far edge of the trench with pistons pointing upward. Next, place three blocks of gravel on each piston so that there is one block of gravel sticking up above the ground. Behind each piston, place a solid block that accepts redstone, and then place a bit of redstone on each of these blocks, as well as the blocks behind them. From there, run a redstone line to the lever which we'll use to work the blast shields, keeping in mind that redstone can accept a signal from the block above it (making it feasible to have the lever inside your house, preferably near the window you wish to protect).

The final product should look like this (all the redstone should be off and the cobblestone is the window):

Layer -3














































































































Layer -2














































































































Layer -1














































































































Layer 0














































































































Layer 1








































Layer 2







































Layer 3








































After that, cover the redstone circuitry with whatever you wish to protect it against damage, and you're good to go!

Note: If you're good enough with redstone, you can also have all blast shields around your house hooked up to a single lever, which you can flip whenever you need to.
This is a nice feature to add to the windows of your Nether bases.

### Exploding statues
Surprising foes makes any weapon effective! No one knows when a fancy statue is a literal bomb! To make one, fill a statue with TNT, then add some underground redstone leading to a button to activate it. Activating detectors makes this defense automatic,though beware of mobs or players setting it off! Building it near a base is not wise. Normal rails and one block of activator rail with some power applied can replace a large redstone usage if statue is lower than the shelter. Push a minecart with TNT down the rail to activate. Remember to add activator rail early on the rail if possible for a quick countdown!

## Other
There are infinite possibilities in Minecraft. These ideas are not always functional but can be fun to make and have.

### Secret room
For your chests with many valuables, in case someone gets in base, they might not find your room to steal your stuff.

### Nether railroad
See also: Tutorials/Nether hub

Every block traveled in the Nether is equivalent to 8 blocks in the overworld. So why not use it to save on materials for building a long rail? You can have a portal in your house and a portal somewhere else connencted by a minecart rail in the nether. This can connect to a village, some cool mountains, a mushroom biome, or another place of interest that would take way too long to walk to. Extremely useful on Large Biomes and island worlds. Plus, you only use ⅛ of the materials you would use in the overworld.

### Statue
This can be made out of any type of wool you want, but usually people build statues of themselves. This serves no purpose in single player except decoration.

### Trophy room
A room with framed trophies from your many victories: your first ghast tear, the enchanted sword you killed a wither with, your first nether star, a block of emerald, etc. Use signs as plaques to mark the origin and perhaps the date of your trophies, give it fancy glowstone lighting, and have a pride-of-place shelf for a wither skeleton skull or perhaps even the dragon egg.

### City
This is a good way to put torches, cobblestone, gravel, and wood to use. First, you should dig out a road (as wide and long as you want it) then fill the holes in with gravel, then build as many cabins as you want in each cabin put a table, a chair, and a chest, then light it up and put a wooden door on each one. Then build a restaurant, this should have some chairs and tables, and in the kitchen put a chest full of food and coal, then put furnaces in the kitchen, if you want to make it really nice add outdoor seating, and if you're on multiplayer charge people to eat there. Then add a store (only build this if you're on multiplayer). It should have lots of sorted chests. It's recommended you hire a guard to guard the valuables. Now add your house, this should have a bed, a crafting table, and a chest, and anything else you want. Now add a fountain in the center of the city. Finally add a bunch of mini houses containing chests, and a crafting table.

### Museum
This can be about various things. Minecraft, you, your worlds, or a favorite mob can be among ideas.

If you want it to look grand on the outside, place large pillars around it. Also, a grand staircase to a large front entrance helps.

If you build this in multiplayer, hire guards/security to guard your beautiful creation.

### Secret base
If you are in multiplayer, you don't want anyone getting into an underground base, right? Well, dig down at least three blocks and make a room. Then get out and put a piece of dirt over the entrance and place a sapling. Put bonemeal on it. Then dig the piece of dirt out and make a hill one block away from the tree. Dig one block into the hill and place sticky pistons so that when they come out they stick to the tree trunks and pull it back or forth, thus opening the entrance and closing it. After that, you need to expand the base so it's actually useful!
