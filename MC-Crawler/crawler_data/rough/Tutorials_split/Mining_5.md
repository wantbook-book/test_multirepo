#### 
1. Pick a place where the player wants the shaft
2. Mine a first block adjacent to the block they are standing at.
	1. Step down.
	2. Mine a block the player were standing at and one below it.
	3. Place a ladder every block, skip this step if the player wants to place scaffolding.
	4. Go to step 2.
3. Continue in above pattern until they reach their desired depth. From then on use a horizontal mining method of their choice. Put scaffolding if the player doesn't want to place ladders.

##### Simpler variant
1. Pick a place where the player wants the shaft.
2. Stand on the dividing line between two blocks.
	1. Mine the two blocks they are standing on, being ready to stop if need be.
	2. Place a ladder every block.
	3. Go to step 1.
3. Continue in above pattern until the player reach desired depth. From then on use a horizontal mining method of their choice.

##### Even simpler variant
1. Go intosneak mode.
2. Stand in the middle of two blocks. These will form the mineshaft.
3. Look directly downwards and hold the mine input, mining straight down.
4. After 4 blocks, you'll be out of range. Keep holding mine and move slightly right or left to mine the other column.
5. Mine until you no longer can. Should be 8 blocks. Move to the other column.
	1. (Optional) Mine anyiron/coalin the walls of the shaft.
6. Repeat pattern until at desired depth.

This method is fast and secure, as you can see hazards in advance and avoid them due to the fact that you can't fall off blocks in sneak mode. It also requires very little in the way of player input, making it quasi-semiautomatic. To ascend simply pillar up using the copious amounts of stone you have no doubt amassed in the course of your tunneling. Word of warning: this method consumes about 80 percent of the durability of a stone pickaxe. Be sure to bring wood to make a crafting table and sticks to craft a replacement.

#### 
Similar to 1×2, but players have more room to place torches, ladders, or footholds in case they fall off the ladder. They will also get more warning of gravel masses, caverns, or lava, and an extra block of room to deal with them. This is relatively safe, and is a good way to start a mine from the base.

The more common version runs the ladders down the middle of the wide side, that is put blocks to break the fall on both sides every few levels, and at their mining levels, but another way to do it is to put ladders on one end, and put a waterfall on the other. They can then put a few blocks in the middle to prevent falls, but leave plenty of spaces to pop out of the waterfall for a breath.

#### 
The player want to excavate one level at a time, placing ladders down one corner of the block. This technique is relatively safe.

### Vertical mineshaft with water drop
Cutaway of the top of the mineshaft. (1) Entrance passage (2) Ascent shaft (3) Descent shaft.
Cutaway of the bottom of the mineshaft. Note the placement of torches in the ascent and descent shafts. (1) Ascent shaft (2) Descent shaft (3) Water pit (4) Side passage to utility room/mining area.
A vertical mine shaft can be built quickly and allows safe, fast access to the deepest regions of the map. To descend to the bottom, simply walk into the shaft. The player will pass over the ascent shaft, fall into the descent shaft, and land in the water pit. To ascend, climb the ladder and hop out.

This guide describes the construction of a vertical mine shaft with the following properties:

- Provides quick access to the lowest mining levels
- Fast construction

Drawbacks:

- Unsuitable forminecarts
- Requires a decent amount of wood
- Slow Ascension

Materials:

- 64ladders
- 2water buckets
- 20torches
- Pickaxesandshovels

The log requirements amount to approximately 60 blocks of log.

#### Construction
Overview

1. Gather all materials
2. Dig 3-wide pit to bedrock
3. Dig utility room
4. Dig and fill water pit
5. Place ladders in ascent shaft
6. Fill in center of shaft

Details

First, gather and manufacture the materials. Be sure to fill the buckets with water. The shaft will be constructed to the side of an existing room. Start by excavating a 3-block deep alcove. If the top of the shaft is above ground, it should be surrounded by fences or walls with only one entrance on a narrow side. Place one torch in the end of the alcove as illustrated.

Next, a 3-block wide pit will be dug all the way down to the bedrock. Do not dig out the block the player are standing on. Dig out a 3-high by 2-wide section, then hop down into it and dig out the 3-high column that the player were standing on. Place torches on both sides (ascent and descent) at regular intervals, excavating 1 block to place them in. In the ascent shaft, torches should be placed in the wide sides so they don't interfere with the ladder. In the descent shaft, torches should be place in the narrow side, primarily so that the player can keep track of which side is ascent and which is descent.

Be careful when digging out any blocks beside the player. Lateral breaches into lava pools or monster caves can be hazardous. Be ready to plug the hole, or hop up and throw blocks down so the player can escape upwards. Also, be sure that the 3×2 section hasn't opened into a cavern before players hop down. Keep the pit well-lit. When players reach the bedrock level, make a 3-deep pit on the descent side. Fill in the middle and ascent sides as needed, as in the screenshot.

The water trough in the utility room.
In the middle of the shaft, cut a side shaft. Due to the fact that the landing pit must be 3 deep, they may want to stairstep downward a few blocks in this shaft. Next, dig out a utility room. Cut a 3×1 horizontal trough in this room for water. Empty each bucket into the end of this trough. The water should fill it in and become still.

Fill the buckets again from the center of the water trough. Use the water to fill the pit at the bottom of the descent shaft. Be sure that the pit is 3 deep, and each block is filled with water.

Now it's time to place the ladders and to fill in the center of the shaft. Stand in the ascent shaft and face away from the descent shaft. Place ladders on the wall in front of the player and climb. Build the ladder all the way to the top.

Descend to the bottom again using the ladder. Be careful, because the center of the shaft is not filled in yet, and it's possible to fall to their death. Once at the bottom, stand in the middle of the shaft and fill it with blocks. Hop upward and place blocks beneath themselves. When they reach the top, leave the central pillar 1 block below the surface (see screenshot). Leaving it 1 block lower allows players to enter the descent shaft simply by walking in.

Alternate landing

Instead of a 3-block deep water landing pit, if players place two blocks of water at the bottom of the shaft in the ceiling of their utility room at the bottom and "hold it in place" with a sign on the wall below the shaft, it will break their fall as they fall through it and they will land without damage on the bottom of their utility room area.
