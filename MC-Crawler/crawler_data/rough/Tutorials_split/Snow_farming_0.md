# Tutorials/Snow farming
Snow farms allow for quickly obtaining a large amount of snowballs, which can be further crafted into snow blocks and snow layers. The easiest way to make a snow farm is to use snow golems to produce the snow, which is what most farms use.

## Usage
There are many benefits to making a snow farm. Here is a list of some of them:

- To combine with apumpkinfarm, allowing the construction of a huge army of snow golems, which can be used to either throw snowballs at mobs, or to produce more snow.
- Snow blocks are a decent building material as long as they don't have to resist explosions; contrary to all logic, they don't melt. Thus, an easy-to-build snow farm (and a material to make lots of shovels) can avoid the need to haul many stacks of cobblestone or other material to a build site for constructing large farms.
- Hostile mobs cannot spawn on snow layers stacked 2 or more deep, if light sources aren't desired for a build.
- Endermencannot teleport onto snow layers stacked 10 or more deep.
- To use as weapons againstblazes, saving the durability of yourswordorbowfor other mobs.

## Location
The farm must be built in a biome where a snow golem can survive and generate snow. Thus, the farm cannot be built in the Nether, deserts (all variants), badlands (all variants), or savannas (except variants listed below), and it also must be built above certain altitudes in other biomes, due to temperature decrease with altitude:

- Above Y≈64 in plains, sunflower plains, swamps (including swamp hills), and beaches
- Above Y≈124 in mushroom fields and shore
- Above Y≈154 in jungles and variants
- Above Y≈184 in savanna plateau and shattered savanna plateau
- Above Y≈244 in shattered savanna

Snow farms can be built an any altitude in cold and snowy biomes, which are stone beaches, taigas, mountains, snowy taigas, and snowy tundra biomes (as well as variants).

Snow farms can be built at any level in river biomes (without the snow golem melting), which are reasonably easy to find, even in areas full of deserts, savannas, and badlands. If you are near an ocean, your farm will work on an island, even if it is next to a desert or other hot biome. 

One nice thing you can take advantage of is the fact that even if you completely drain a river, it will still stay a river biome, and therefore allow snow farms. This applies to oceans as well, but it is much easier to drain a section of a river than it is to drain up a section of an ocean.

## Piston Based Automated Snowball Farm
On Bedrock Edition snow layers can be broken by moving a block or piston head into the space occupied by snow layers, dropping snowballs. A simple fully-automated farm can therefore be made using a snow golem to create snow layers, breaking those layers using pistons and collecting the snowballs via hoppers. It is also possible to create a semi-automated snow block farm by pushing the snowballs into the player inventory, using a dropper, where they can be easily crafted into snow blocks as the farm runs.

## Manual Snowball Farm
### Materials
Before creating a snow farm, make sure that the player has all of the materials. Here is a list of the materials they will need to build a snow farm:

- Twosnow blocks
- Onecarved pumpkin
- One block that is not broken quickly with a shovel and which can havesnow layersplaced on it, such asstoneorcobblestone.
- Additional blocks to confine the golem and protect it from rain, depending on the farm location.

To operate the farm, the player will need one or more shovels and inventory space sufficient to collect a lot of snowballs. Note that snowballs only stack to 16. However, 4 snowballs can be crafted into snow blocks, which stack to 64, and yield the 4 snowballs used to craft them when mined, making a stack of snow blocks equivalent to 256 snowballs. So, if you're running out of inventory space, you can craft the snowballs into snow blocks. Later, when you are ready to use the snowballs, place the blocks on the ground and mine them.
