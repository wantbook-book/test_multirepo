### Top Down
This way works better if you don't actually have a lake yet—in fact if you do, you'll need to fill most of it in with dirt, except for the top layer.  (If you don't have a lake or valley at all, you instead dig out the top layer, or at least a 2-block wide outline, 1 block deep.)  Go around the edge of your one-block deep depression, and place water in an alternating pattern, like one color of a checkerboard.  You should only need to go a couple of squares in—that is, every other space at the edge, and the alternating spaces just inside them—before the water springs multiply to fill your space.  If you dug the two-block-outline, at this point you should dig out the interior and let the springs multiply over the whole area.  Check for any missing springs and fill them.  

Then, you dig out the next layer of your lake, or a 2-block outline.  Again, place springs, but make sure to put them against the new floor.  Again, finish digging out the second level of the lake, and let the springs multiply.  Repeat for as many layers as you want—for deeper bottoms, you may need help to stay down there long enough to dig.  Placing temporary doors is a "low-tech" solution, but can destroy springs—to fix that, on your way up, replace the door with two blocks of sand or dirt (plus one if you mined the block beneath it), then mine them from the top down.  If you have a helmet with Respiration and/or Aqua Affinity, that can help a lot with deeper lakes.  A potion of Night Vision can make it easier to see what you're doing.

### Creative Mode or Silk Touch enchantments Only
Fill your lake with ice blocks.  Place Glowstone blocks on top of the ice every two blocks away. Let the ice melt. Since ice blocks under water blocks turn to water, you only need to melt the top layer. Finally, destroy your glowstone blocks.

Ice is obtainable in survival mode with use of the silk touch enchantment on any tool.

## 
NOTE: A current means there is no spring at the location it is pointing, so when we say "fill the current" we really mean "fill the empty block causing the current". 
If there are currents, it's alright, you can fix it rather easily. Depending on the kind of lake you've made and the placement of the current, you should either:

1) Make a line of blocks at the water level and reach the current. When that is done, place a spring on the side to stop the current. Unfortunately, you will need to replace every spring you've eliminated by placing blocks. If you don't want to go through this hassle, you can place the line of blocks one level deeper and reach the current from below. A new spring will be created automatically above the new base you just created. Destroy the line and you're done.

2) If the pool isn't too deep, you can place a column of blocks that goes under the current, the water will automatically create a new spring to replace the missing one. 

3) If it's an under water current, it means there's a hole in the wall or a stray block is blocking the water above this point. If it's a hole, fill it with either a spring of water or a block according to your preferences/plans. if it's a stray block, destroy it to allow the passage of water or if you want to keep a block there, fill the hole under it with water.

## Swimming in a Lake
Sadly, there is a con to making lakes this way: while it definitively takes less time, the way the springs are placed will create a downward current. Swimming up in an artificial lake will take a lot more time because of that, however you can fix it by two ways: 

First, you can actually fill the hole you made with springs. This will take some time depending of the size of your lake but it will be far easier to swim. I added a sub section with more info to do that in a faster way. See "Pure Lake". 

Second, you can place one or more collumns of springs. While it will still look like a uniform lake, you will have access at a couple of sweet spots to swim up faster. The downside is that if your lake is a little too deep, you'll be dependent of those to swim up. However it will be very useful if you know exactly where you'll need to surface every time.

The  represents only the springs. While the top layer of springs will drop a downward current, the column of springs on the right will have no downward current, thus it won't slow you if you swim upward.
