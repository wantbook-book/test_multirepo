### Desert Temple
Materials

- At least 15 torches
- 5 doors
- A trapdoor
- Ladders

Description

Desert Temples are not only good shelters, but also contain worthwhile loot such as emeralds, diamonds, gold, iron, and bones, but do look out for the secret chamber with a pressure plate and the 3×3 grid of TNT!

Location

Desert Temple, found exclusively in desert biomes.

Construction

- Find a Desert Temple. They usually spawn in deserts and can sometimes even be found near NPC Villages.
- (MUST be done first). Get some torches, a pickaxe, and some ladders and dig straight down 2 blocks outside the blue stained clay in the center, be careful not to activate the pressure plate.
- Destroy the pressure plate and take the loot from the chest and the TNT under the sandstone.
- Use ladders to get back up. You can use the underground chest room later as a room or expand from using the 1×1×2 spaces where the chests were as doorways.
- Light up the entire structure using torches.
- Add a door at the front, the 2 hallways to the 2 towers on either side and to the 2 doorways near the top of the pyramid.
- Add a ladder for easy access to the second floor above the stained clay.
- Add a trapdoor onto the hole above the blue stained clay.
- Add any necessary items such as chests, beds, Crafting tables, and furnaces.

Extras

- Add some fences around the walkways on the pyramid roof to keep any hostile mobs at bay.
- Build walls around the entire temple and light up the exterior to fortify it further
- Expand the lower chamber to accommodate farms, mines, an enchanting room, a smelting and/or anvil room, or whatever else you wish.

### 
Materials

- Lots of dirt or any other kind of non-physical block
- Few torches

Description

A pillar of blocks, occupying a 1×1 space with (optionally) a small platform at the top to improve safety. Great when you have lots of one type of non-entity block. Only use a block that is affected by gravity, e.g. sand, gravel; if you want to remove the pillar later on. Remember, do not build a short pillar. We are talking about a cloud-level pillar here. 

Location

Anywhere, but preferably a forest biome.

Construction

First, equip your block. Then, point at the ground, hold your right mouse button and jump. Repeat until you are at cloud level or any other level that skeleton arrows cannot reach you. After that, in order to minimize the risk of falling off, build a platform at the top of the pillar and light it up. It's all up to you on what you want to do with the shelter after that. For the Nomadic player, just stay up there until the sun rises. Dismantle the platform (if present) and mine the pillar blocks below you, until you reach ground level. 

REMEMBER: If you are planning on building a real shelter up there, do not build above layer 250 (as the height limit is just above you and could compromise your structure.)

### Watchtower
Materials

- About 40 blocks of your choice for the central pillar
- About 25 blocks for the rim
- Fences to add guardrails (can be ignored if you are careful)
- A ladder to get up and down the tower
- A door and a trapdoor to ease with entry
- A few torches.

Description

An expanded version of the above pillar and platform, this shelter is now a proper tower, allowing it to be shorter in height without losing protective capability.

A good shelter should not only protect you from any type of hostile mobs during the night, but also prevent a surprise Creeper ambush in the morning. This shelter type achieves this without the need for sophisticated materials such as glass or doors and can be set up pretty quickly.

The design is essentially a tower with a rim for night-time protection, but with some gaps between the tower and rim to see what is going on below in the morning, and have a slash at any assembled hostiles before leaving the shelter.

Location

This shelter is best suited for wide-open terrain or hilltops.

Construction

- Build a simple 3×3×6 solid tower.
- Once you get to the top of the tower, build out a 5×5 rim on it and add fences to the edges.
- Add torches to light up the rim.
- Dig a 1×1×6 shaft inside the center of the tower.
- Addladdersand atrapdoorto the shaft and add adoorto the entrance. Wait for dawn inside the shaft, behind locked (trap)doors.

### Open-Air
Not what you think.

Materials

- Dirt

Description

Sure, it might not stop invading spiders, (To stop invading spiders: Get some extra blocks to go around the top level of your walls. Spiders may climb, but not upside down!), but at least it works for the first night! The Open-Air is basically walls surrounding you. No roof. This can easily transition into a permanent house. Feel free to add a roof after you build the walls, but it won't be an Open-Air any more at that point.

Location

Flat, open ground. 

Construction

First, gather your dirt and basic necessities. Place your dirt in a (preferably, size is up to you) 5×5 area. Once you've built a 1-layer 'wall', build until you have a 3-layer wall. By this time, it should be sunset. Again, the time will vary, depending on the number of layers on your wall. After you have built your wall, jump down to your 'shelter'. Done! Note that spiders will be able to climb over the walls and enter your shelter, and phantoms will still fly in, but adding a rim will prevent spiders from invading your home. Enjoy your night. 
Don't fill the area! An optional way to do this is to instead dig a pit and dig out the blocks around where the wall is. This way you're gaining materials instead of using them.

Extras

- Torches
- Add a roof (doing so will turn your Open-Air into a proper house, in which you're free on expanding)
- Improved wall (stone, for example.)
- Windows (which are highly recommended to be built, only if you want to add a roof)
