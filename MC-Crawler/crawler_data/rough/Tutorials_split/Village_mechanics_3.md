## Cats
In Java Edition, cats are spawned around players in or near villages. A random position is chosen near the player, and a cat is spawned if that position is within a 5×5×5 subchunk cube around a village center subchunk, and the position is within 48 blocks of at least 4 claimed beds and fewer than 5 cats are within a 97×17×97 box centered around the spawn position.

Cats spawned in this way may despawn if not tamed.

In Bedrock Edition, the number of cats spawned in a village is based on the number of beds in that village. Cats require only one villager, and one cat can spawn for every four beds, claimed or not. Up to 40 beds can be present for a maximum of 10 cats, and cats respawn based on the number of beds.

If there are two villages, each already with 10 cats, merging the villages into a single village does not cause any cats to despawn. However, the number of cats is still capped at 10, so no new cats spawn until the number of cats is below 10.

The player can run cats out of the village, thus allowing for more cats to spawn.

## Iron golems
See also: Tutorials/Iron golem farm

In Java Edition, iron golems are spawned when villagers are talking. Their spawning requirements are:

1. The villager must be gossiping with another villager or panicking
2. The villager has not seen an iron golem recently
3. The villager has slept in the past day
4. 5 villagers (3 if panicking) within 10 blocks meet those requirements (other than #1)
5. The random location chosen for the iron golem isn't air or liquid that blocks light.

Random location choosing is attempted 10 times within 16 blocks of the villager, and is attempted once from 6 blocks above the chosen x and z, to 6 blocks below it.

In Bedrock Edition, iron golems are spawned in villages meeting these requirements:

1. The village has at least 20 beds and at least 10 villagers
2. 75% of the villagers must have worked in the past day
3. All of the villagers must be linked to a bed
4. The village must be within a player'ssimulation distancevolume
5. There must be space to spawn an iron golem within a 16×6×16 volume around thevillage center

To clarify, iron golems can spawn as long as the player is within simulation range of the village's boundaries; being near the village center is not necessary. Simulation distance remains consistent both horizontally and vertically. The formula for calculating simulation range is as follows:

SimulationRange=8×SimulationDistance

Iron golems will spawn within a 16×6×16 volume around the village center. A spawn is attempted on average once every 35 seconds and an iron golem can spawn when the 2×4×2 volume above the spawn point contains only non-solid blocks and the spawn block is solid.

## Zombie sieges
Main article: Zombie siege

  

This feature is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


At midnight, there is a 10% chance that a zombie siege might occur. This is when a large number of zombies spawn in or near a village, attacking what villagers they can reach, crowding around and pounding on the doors of those they can't. On Hard or Hardcore mode, they can actually break down the wooden doors (this is true of all zombies, not just during sieges). They'll attempt to beat them down on other difficulties, but not succeed.

Zombies in sieges ignore the 24-block minimum distance from the player, but other than that, behave absolutely normally (i.e., they do not spawn on glowstone or any other transparent or half block, need a 2×1×1 minimum space, etc.). Houses can be zombie-proofed by taking out one ground block from directly in front of the door, and if necessary, rehanging the door such that the outside is flush with the outside wall. This is because zombies can break only the top half of a door, and if they have to jump, they cannot get through. In addition, players can fill the hole with two layers of carpet to achieve the same effect as zombies cannot pathfind into the door.

## Raids
Main article: Raids
When a player with the 'Bad Omen' debuff enters a village, the Bad Omen effect disappears and a raid occurs. Raids are groups of illagers (pillagers, vindicators, evokers, ravagers, and witches) attacking the village with the intent of killing villagers. They can remove the 'Bad Omen' debuff by drinking milk before entering a village to prevent raids; however, the player can also defend a village from a raid, at which point the player gains the 'Hero of the Village' buff. This causes villagers to give the player steep discounts during trading, as well as bestow various gifts upon the player.‌[Java Edition  only]

In Java Edition 1.21, the 'Bad Omen' debuff will be replaced with 'Raid Omen'.
