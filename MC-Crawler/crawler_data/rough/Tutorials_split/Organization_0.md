# Tutorials/Organization
Organization is a very important habit to have in Minecraft. Organization helps with finding things quickly and easily, especially later in the game when you have collected a lot of materials. It takes a long time to find what you need when it is cluttered up. This tutorial is intended for players who prefer to store items in specific categories.

## Storage
Early on in the game, one double chest can fit most of your items, such as wood, weapons, and tools. However, to progress further in the game, you eventually need to make storage rooms with categorized chests to store items. Chests, shulker boxes and barrels are some of the most important blocks in the game. Here are the basic steps for organizing everything into a good sense of order.

- Build a large room for all your chests. If you are tight on space, you can embed some chests into the floor or make chest "shelves".
- Chests cannot open with a block on top (except transparent blocks liketorches,glass,slabs, and other chests). You can place upside down stairs or half slabs to change this.
- If you want single chests side-by-side without them combining into a large chest, then place them while sneaking to prevent them from joining.‌[Java Edition  only]
- If you have room, you may want to placesignsoritem framesnext to, above, or on the chests to label them and make categorizing easier. To place a sign or item frame on a chest, place it while sneaking.
- If you are tight on space, you can putshulker boxesinside chests for more efficient storage, although looking for one inthe Endearly on in the game is impractical.
- Make your storage facilities sturdy and impenetrable. Don't forget to light up the room so mobs can't spawn inside.
- Catslove to jump onto chests, which prevents the player from opening it. Make them sit down if you let them into a storage room.
- If you have a lot ofiron ingots,gold ingots,wheat,lapis lazuli,snowballs,redstone,emeralds,clay,diamonds,bone meal,dried kelp, orcoal, craft them into their respective blocks to allow for more compact storage.
- Tools,armor,music discs,potions, and a few other things do not stack. Keep this in mind when organizing.




### Categories
Once you have completed your storage rooms, you'll want to be consistent with your organizing across all the singleplayer and multiplayer worlds that you play on. One of the main things to do is to come up with a few general categories for every item and block. The exact categories you decide to organize items vary between players–organize them in a way that is convenient for you. Here are some suggestions:

| Category      | Blocks/Items                                                                                                                      | Examples                                                                                                                                                                               |

A section of a storage room that has its chests sorted by their position in the creative inventory.
Remember that many items can fit in multiple categories. For example, most types of food would also fit into the mob drops or natural categories. You must decide what categories have priority over others.

Another idea for organization is to organize each chest based on where they are in the Creative inventory. For example, use the labels in the Creative inventory like building blocks, decoration blocks, redstone, tools, combat, and others. Note that this does not work if you have a huge supply of items, but if this is the case, you can divide each category between two different chests.

At the entrance of your house or base, you may want to have a temporary chest that can be used for anything, so you can go farming while you keep your mining or building the setup in an easily accessible place.

It is also helpful to have a chest for items that need to be sorted. This discourages you from simply putting items in random chests when you need to empty your inventory quickly.
