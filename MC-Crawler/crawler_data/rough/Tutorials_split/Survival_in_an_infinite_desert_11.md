This is for Java Edition only.

If you challenge yourself by not allowing the generation of villages or temples etc.—or if you just can't find any—your situation becomes difficult indeed. You can obtain shelter, safety and food using the techniques described above, but you can't obtain any tools and your crafting is extremely limited. You have no easy way to access cobblestone items, and more importantly, no way at all to create a crafting table (no source of planks). With only a two by two crafting grid, even if you had cobblestone, or other tooling material (planks or ingots), you are unable to craft any type of weapons or tools. Not even stone or wooden tools. Without tools and with only limited crafting, progression beyond basic survival is not possible. You must disable villages and temples, but you must enable all other structures.

### Your first day
On your first day, break dead bushes for sticks, and gather dirt and cactus. Gather sand. Use the dirt you got to make your shelter and use cactus for basic defense. Kill as many rabbits as possible for rabbits meat. You must eat them raw at this time.

### Your first night
On your first night, you have to fight monsters with your bare hands. Kill as many zombies for iron ingots and rotten flesh. If you get carrots or potatoes, don't eat them because you can farm them later. Use creepers to blow up skeletons to get bones and arrows. Kill a few witches for glowstone dust. If you can, get some armor from zombies and get an iron shovel or sword for a basic weapon. Note that you might not be able to do all these on your first night. Still, try to get these goals over a few nights. Phantoms appear after 3 nights, which are difficult to fight. When they swoop down, quickly hit them and wait for them to come back down. Repeat until the phantom is dead.

### Getting wood and stone
As long as you enabled generated structures that are not villages and temples, it is possible to get wood and stone.

To get stone, you need to use creepers to blow up the stone. If you are lucky enough to get a golden pickaxe from a ruined portal, you can use it to gather as much stone as possible until the pickaxe breaks.

Wood is more difficult to get. You need to find a pillager outpost or a mineshaft to get logs and planks (only planks in mineshafts). Be careful of cave spiders and pillagers, and make sure you have some armor, at least leather or better.

Once you get a crafting table, you can make stone tools. You should also make a bed. You can get wool from string from killed spiders or cave spiders. If you have an iron ingot, make a shield. If you have more, make a water bucket. Once you have those things, you can go mining (only in buffet, not in superflat). Try to get iron and gold, as well as diamonds if you are lucky. Once you get more iron, make these in order:

- Shield (if you don't have one)
- Bucket
- Iron Pickaxe
- Iron Sword
- Iron Armor

If you find a lava pool, you can use it to make a nether portal or mine obsidian with a diamond pickaxe. Access to the nether makes it possible to beat the game if strongholds are enabled, because you can get blaze rods and ender pearls.

### The Nether
If you are on version 1.16 or later on Java edition or Bedrock edition, then you can create a nether portal using a water bucket and a lava bucket, and light it with a plank to get to the Nether (this works in all versions with the Nether). But use 1.16, because if you find a crimson forest or a warped forest, you can find crimson or warped fungus, which can be used for wood. If you also manage to find a basalt deltas biome, you can use the black stone for a cobblestone source. On all versions with the nether, you can use the nether fortresses to get blaze rods (be careful when doing this, as you can easily die of fire.) to make some eye of enders with blaze rods and ender pearls (found by killing enderman in warped forests, or rarely in the overworld). Next, escape the Nether and use your eyes of ender to find a stronghold and (carefully) beat the ender dragon. Next you can see the tutorials:

### Getting villagers
Getting villagers has many advantages, including getting emeralds for overworld wood, diamond armor and tools, sugarcane, and many other renewable items as well. You need to get two zombie villagers. Each mob spawned has a 1/515 chance to be a zombie villager. You need two splash potions of weakness and two golden apples. 

#### Splash Potion of Weakness
You need a brewing stand and at least 1 blaze powder, which you should have gotten from blaze. The other ingredients are more difficult. To get the water bottles, you need to get it from bartering with piglins if you have not yet obtained wood (for furnaces and fuel). The spider eye can be obtained from killing spiders. To get the brown mushroom, find it underground or in the nether. You can get sugar from sugar canes, or alternatively from killing witches.

#### Golden Apples
You can rarely craft the golden apple because you can get apples only from trees (which exist only in Buffet worlds). However, you can find it in dungeons, mineshafts, bastions, ruined portals and strongholds.
