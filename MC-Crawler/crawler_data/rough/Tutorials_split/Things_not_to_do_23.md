### Careless use of redstone components
Redstone components, especially redstone dust, can create lag. The player should avoid using unnecessary redstone and try to keep the number of running redstone clocks to a minimum. An "off" lever could be useful to deactivate large redstone devices when not in use. Locking hoppers while not in use is also advisable as hoppers produce large amounts of lag.

### Using cursed items
Curse of Binding and Curse of Vanishing are enchantments with negative effects. Unlike other enchantments, which can be removed using a grindstone, you cannot "un-curse" an item. If you obtain a cursed item, either throw them into lava or the Void, or smelt them in a furnace or blast furnace if it is a golden, iron, or a chainmail piece.

Move your cursor over the armor piece before wearing it in case it has curse of binding on it.

If you wear armor that has Curse of Binding, the only way to remove the armor is to die (if not playing on Hardcore) or to let the armor run out of durability. Even if you don't expect to remove the armor, you may later acquire an enchanted book that you want to add to your armor. Doing anything to a piece of armor on an anvil requires that you temporarily remove the armor. You may also want to wear different armor with different enchantments depending on what you are doing. For example, you may normally wear armor with Protection but want to use Fire Protection when exploring in the Nether. You cannot put both Protection and Fire Protection on the same item, so you need multiple pairs of boots. Also, you cannot put both Depth Strider and Frost Walker on boots. If you wear a chestplate with Curse of Binding, you also cannot use elytra.

Curse of Vanishing causes an item to disappear when you die. While it is not dangerous to use an item with Curse of Vanishing, you should not put additional enchantments on such an item, unless playing in Hardcore.

## Multiplayer
### Possible death
#### Equipment for PvP
If the player engages in combat against another player but does not have the correct equipment, they could die and lose any items they have in their inventory.

In a PvP (player vs player) battle, players normally take the best equipment to fight other players. Most use enchanted diamond armor or diamond swords. For PvP, the player should not use anything made out of leather, wood, or gold as armor and tools made of these materials are extremely weak. Some other less straightforward tools such as lava buckets and end crystals may also be used as weapons.

#### Bow attacks
With a few shots from a bow, a player can be killed. Any player who leaves themselves sitting out in the open where they could easily be shot on a server that allows PvP leaves themselves open to this danger and may want to find somewhere with more cover. A shield can be used to completely negate all arrow damage.

#### Attacking players wearing Thorns enchanted armor
Attacking players who are wearing Thorns enchanted armor with a melee weapon damages the attacking player also. The player should use non-melee attacks to avoid being hurt by the Thorns enchanted armor.

#### Trusting strangers
The player should be careful with trusting players they do not know. A player could be dishonest and appear otherwise until they find ways to harm another player or their base and possibly destroy their whole base with TNT.

#### Setting off redstone contraptions carelessly
The player may never know what a redstone contraption may do. It could trigger a trap. The player may want to dig around a pressure plate or button to first discover what it triggers. The player may instead decide to destroy any activation switches to avoid activating anything dangerous.

#### Breaking tripwires
Destroying tripwire without shears triggers the tripwire and any connected traps, similarly to walking over the tripwire. Breaking the tripwire with the shears does not trigger any nasty traps.

#### PvP in water
The player's movement is hampered in water, and while engaging other players in PvP, they may knock the player further into the water so they cannot get out. In this case, it is extremely advisable to stay away from bodies of water.

#### Joining PvP servers earlier
If the player knows the server has newly been made, they should prepare themselves before the rest of the server's players grief the spawn point or begin killing all new players. Now there might be custom set spawn radius (in 1.9) or spawn protection, however, this does not protect the player from being killed for fun once they step out of the area.

### Wasted resources
#### Having the gamerule KeepInventory on Hardcore multiplayer
Usually, when the player dies, they drop their items and respawn. However, in Hardcore mode, once the player dies, they do not respawn. If the player then kept their inventory in a Hardcore world, then it actually consumes their items rather than dropping them which would in Multiplayer not allow other players to retrieve the dead player's items they lost. This system could be used if a player does not want items dropped upon the death of a player.

### Other
#### Moving beds
Beds can be helpful by letting players skip through night and set their spawn point. At the same time, if blocks are placed around a bed, the player's bed is destroyed, or a second player sleeps in the same bed the player last slept in, their spawn is set back to the world spawn instead of next to the bed. Players can avoid angering fellow players by not messing with their beds.
