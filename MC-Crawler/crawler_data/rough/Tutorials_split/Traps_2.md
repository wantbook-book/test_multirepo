### Warehouse trap
This trap takes a long time to make but the payoff is worth it. make a big warehouse, about 50x50 for best results. underneath the floor add TNT in a checkerboard pattern.

next, you add a 15 second redstone repeater delay set to a pressure plate on the enterance. when the target enters this warehouse to steal your items.

The TNT underneath them slowly ignites, exploding the warehouse and anything in it. leaving no time to escape.

### End portal trap
If you have enough TNT, a dispenser, and an input, it can't hurt to pump some TNT into the End Portal. The TNT will go to the spawn point of the world and will be loaded, as the spawn chunks are always loaded, and will explode soon after. If nobody is in the end, the first player enter the portal will make the chunks load, which will instantly kill that player.

### Bog-standard landmine
This landmine by itself is inefficient and non-lethal. It damages the landscape and deals little if any damage to players. It is easy to make by placing a pressure plate on a block and one or more TNT directly beneath. Stepping on the pressure plate will ignite the TNT To make it more efficient, there are many variations players can use:

- If you want to protect the landscape, you can place 2 water sources at the bottom of the hole. Place a slab at the bottom as sand/ gravel may quench the water source. This method will reduce the dealt damage, however.
- This is well disguised next to adoor; the player may think it is to open the door.
- By digging a pit underneath it, the player might fall into it.
- Try to camouflage the landmine by making it less noticeable, e.g. grow tall grass around it.
- Concrete powder cannot be used in this design, the concrete powder will harden into concrete upon contacting water and quench the water source.


### Instant landmine 1






































Side view
TNT, when activated normally, plays an audible hissing sound and waits for a few seconds before blowing up, which can give anyone plenty of time to escape a landmine placed on the ground. A much more dangerous landmine with instant activation can be built instead:

1. Dig a 3×3×3 hole in the ground, jump in, and stand on a corner.
2. On the center, place a block of dirt and arailon top of it.
3. On the rail, place aminecart with TNT. Be careful not to push it.
4. Destroy the block under the rail to derail the minecart. The minecart will fall one block lower, this won't really cause any damage unless you accidentally pushed the minecart.
5. Put adispenserwithflint and steelabove the minecart like shown.
6. Surround the minecart with TNT, cover it all up, and place apressure plateon top.


### Instant landmine 2






































Side view
Replace the wool with an end crystal, and put an arrow in the dispenser.
when the dispenser is activated, it will shoot an arrow and blow up the crystal, leaving no time to escape.

Sculk Proximity Instant Landmine construction process.
This one's a bit tricky to build. It requires both precise placement of TNT minecarts and extreme care not to set the trap off yourself. Do everything in order and make liberal use of the Sneak key and you'll be fine. Probably. Test it several times in Creative Mode just to be sure.The top row has an empty space labeled with ESC. This is your escape route.

First dig a hole 2×2 wide and 3 deep. Seal off the top with matching blocks. Surround the hole with a 2 block high wall of wool, leaving a Steve-sized gap for your escape route. Do not fill it back in yet. In the spot where you left the gap, dig out an escape route leading directly away from the mine. Return to your wool pit. Place two powered rails (keeping them unpowered) along the wall opposite of your escape route (you do NOT want the TNT carts in the way of your escape). Here's where things start to get tricky. You need to place at least two TNT carts on the same powered rail. The trap will not work otherwise. Placing the first will of course be easy. For subsequent carts, you will need to right click carefully on the side hitbox of the track that the first cart is on. The top will not work, as the first cart is in the way. You'll know it worked if the minecart's shadow gets noticeably darker, or know, if your hand empties. Once you find the right spot, feel free to place as many TNT carts as you care to sacrifice. More carts means a bigger, more powerful explosion, and significantly less chance of escaping the blast (though it's not much of a chance to begin with). Just make sure not to bump the carts. Now is where things go from tricky to deadly. One wrong move will make you the victim of your own trap. This is when you hold Shift like your life depends on it, because it absolutely does. While holding Shift and not letting go, place the sculk sensor, either adjacent to or in front of your escape hole. Now, still holding Shift, sneak your way into your escape hole. This is where you finally close the gap in the Steve-sized wool wall hole, making sure there is no hole for the Sculk Sensor to hear you through. You should be safe by this point, but if you want to be extra careful, continue sneaking as you move away from your newly planted mine.



That should be it! Just whatever you do, do NOT step over your landmine. You will almost certainly die. Save the dying for the enemy. It's also worth noting that currently in 21w06a, carpets do not muffle sound, unlike full wool blocks, which makes this an effective floor bomb, easily concealed under a rug. However, there's a decent chance that this may change in the full release of 1.17.
