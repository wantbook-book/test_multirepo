# Tutorials/Playing with a controller
Here is a tutorial on how to use a game controller (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, etc.) for playing Minecraft.

Minecraft: Bedrock Edition officially supports game controllers. You can play the game with controllers easily by connecting them to your PC or consoles, wired or wireless, and without having to use third-party tools. However, the opposite is true for Minecraft: Java Edition. 

Minecraft: Java Edition lacks the native support for game controllers, and in order to play Minecraft: Java Edition with a controller, there are two workarounds you can use instead: using Steam as a middleware to provide controller support for the game, or using community mods.

## Connecting a controller to Windows
### PlayStation DualSense and DualShock 4 controllers
You can connect your DualShock 4 or DualSense controllers into your Windows computer, however, Windows UI navigation using these controllers is not supported, this includes the Windows controller keyboard.

#### Wired
Simply plug in the controller into a USB port on the computer by using micro USB cable for PS4 and USB type C cable for PS5.

#### Wireless
Placement of Share and PlayStation buttons on the DualShock 4.
This only works if your computer has Bluetooth enabled.

1. Press and hold the Share and the PlayStation buttons on the controller until it starts flashing. When the controller starts flashing, the controller is ready to be paired.
2. Open "Bluetooth & devices" on the Windows settings.
3. Click "Add device" button, and in the menu, click the "Bluetooth" button.
4. Wait until "Wireless Controller" appears on the device list, and then connect.
5. Your controller is now connected.

### Xbox One and Xbox Wireless Controller
##### Wired
Simply plug in the controller into a USB port on the computer by using micro USB cable for Xbox One controllers and USB type C cable for Xbox Wireless Controllers.

##### Wireless
Placement of Xbox and Pair buttons on the Xbox Wireless Controller.
Note: the first-gen Xbox One controllers do not have Bluetooth. For those controllers, you need a Wireless Adapter for Windows. 
Make sure that any Xbox consoles is unplugged because the controller may turn on Xbox consoles.

2. Hold the Pair button on the top of the controller in the middle until the controller flashes quickly.
3. Open "Bluetooth & devices" on the Windows settings.
4. Select "Xbox Wireless Controller" in the menu of available devices.

## Java Edition workarounds
### Steam

  

This article is missing information about a way to add Minecraft Launcher from Microsoft Store as a non-steam game. Microsoft Store version of the launcher is not available in the non-Steam game list. 
Please expand the article to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page.


This method is the easiest, as it only requires you to download Steam and don't have to use any mods. 
Here’s the simple process of setting up a controller to use with Minecraft: Java Edition on PC:

1. Download Steamif you do not have it in your PC.
2. Open Steam, and then navigate to "Library".
3. Add Minecraft Launcher as a non-Steam game by clicking the "Add a Game" button, then click "Add a Non-Steam Game", and then selecting the Minecraft Launcher in the list.
4. Right click Minecraft Launcher in the game list, then click the "Properties..." button.
5. Select Controller settings, and then click the underlined "Controller Configurator" in the text to allow you to configure the controller layout. You can either do it manually or click the controller icon and browse presets from other users in the Steam community.
6. Start the game through Steam. You can now use your controller to playMinecraft: Java Edition!

Unfortunately, this method only supports the legacy Minecraft Launcher downloaded from the official website, and not from Microsoft Store. However, you can try out the next method below using community-made mods.
