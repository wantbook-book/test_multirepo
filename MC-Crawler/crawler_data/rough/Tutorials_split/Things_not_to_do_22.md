### Being careless with horses
Horses, donkeys, and mules are quick and some can give the player a place to keep excess items. The player should always keep a lead and a fence on hand when out with their horse to tie it up if the player dismounts it. If the player is going far, they may want to take a mule or donkey to help carry food and resources while providing a ride. The player should never dangle their horse from a high place with a lead. The player should be careful not to hit a horse if they own wolves, as the wolves may kill it. The player can name similarly-colored horses to help tell them apart.

### Settling in villages carelessly
Villages are great places to live. They provide you with free food, resources and shelter. However, you may want to take some precautions when settling in.

- Secure the lava in the blacksmith's house, if present.
- Build bridges and walls where necessary.
- Light up all the houses and pathways as they are not always adequately lit.
- Avoid hitting villagers and iron golems if there is at least one iron golem in the village.

### Doing raids in your base
This is important for people with villagers in their base. If your base has lots of fortifications and you are experienced enough to tackle a raid without losing any villagers, it may be a good idea to do a raid in your base. However, for other players, it is not the best idea. For example, you can risk losing valuable villagers, even if you blocked them off (attacks from vexes), ravagers destroying your crops and custom trees, pillagers shooting wooden buttons, entities and pressure plates, activating redstone contraptions and/or destroying minecarts, boats, armor stands, item frames, etc. If you are fighting near your spawn point and get killed by your spawn point, you end up stuck in a death loop because you respawn and get killed by the raider again. (This is not as much as a problem for experienced players) If you have to do a raid, consider blocking those things off and summoning as many iron golems as possible, especially near crop farms and villager trading halls, as the raiders can destroy it.

### Breaking Bedrock
Outside of Creative mode, bedrock is unobtainable without the use of glitches. It also is unbreakable outside of Creative mode without the use of glitches, so attempting to break it just wastes time. A player who really wants to break some bedrock must be in Creative mode or use one of the glitches shown in Tutorials/Breaking bedrock.

### Taking risks
If the player's hunger bar is full, they regenerate lost hearts quickly, at the cost of hunger points. Sometimes, an earlier risk is better than a long term one such as if the player were jumping down a mountain when night is about to fall. It may, in this case, be is a safer option to jump down, than to build their way down when night is about to fall. Risk sometimes depends on what the player is carrying with them, as rarer items could be lost in more dangerous situations. Creeper explosions can help fight mobs. Spider eyes can be useful as food, even though they cause a short effect of poison. If the player has low health, has the gamerule for regenerating health turned to false, or is playing in Hardcore Mode, they may need to judge the risk of certain situations differently.

Sometimes, you might have to build down, if you have a diamond or netherite sword and armor enchanted with Sharpness V and Protection IV, you can most likely cut down swathes of mobs. Sometimes, the enchantment might be Smite V, and there might be a lot of undead mobs coming up.

### Carelessness around redstone contraptions
Redstone mechanisms can be dangerous if not used correctly. For example, the player might make a mistake and push a block into their own head and suffocate or blow themselves up, or trap themselves inside the build. This also breaks the redstone build, which costs time to repair.

Another danger is accidentally placing a water bucket, as redstone components are broken by water.
