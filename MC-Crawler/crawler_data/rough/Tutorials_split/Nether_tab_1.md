## Oh Shiny
Distract Piglins with gold

Requirements: Throw a gold-related item at a piglin while not wearing golden armor.

First, get an adult piglin to become aggressive toward you while you are not wearing any golden armor. Attacking the piglin while wearing any golden armor will not trigger the advancement.

Then, throw one of the following items item at the piglin:

- Bell
- Block of Gold
- Block of Raw Gold
- Clock
- Deepslate Gold Ore
- Enchanted Golden Apple
- Gilded Blackstone
- Glistering Melon Slice
- Gold Ingot
- Gold Ore
- Golden Apple
- Golden Axe
- Golden Boots
- Golden Carrot
- Golden Chestplate
- Golden Helmet
- Golden Hoe
- Golden Horse Armor
- Golden Leggings
- Golden Pickaxe
- Golden Shovel
- Golden Sword
- Light Weighted Pressure Plate
- Nether Gold Ore
- Raw Gold

Any other items, even if they are gold-related, will not unlock this advancement.

Alternatively you can use a gold ingot on a piglin to force a trade to begin, thus granting the advancement.

Once the piglin starts admiring the item, you will be rewarded the advancement.

Ride a Strider with a Warped Fungus on a Stick

Requirements: Ride and boost a strider with a warped fungus on a stick.

You need two items: a warped fungus on a stick and a saddle. A warped fungus on a stick can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients                                             | Crafting recipe |
|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Fishing Rodor<br/>DamagedFishing Rod+<br/>Warped Fungus |                 |

A saddle can be obtained in a few ways. It can be found in loot chests of dungeons, ancient cities, bastion remnants, desert pyramids, end cities, jungle pyramids, nether fortresses, strongholds and villages (weaponsmith's chest, savanna house chest or tanner's chest). You can get a saddle from fishing or from trading with master-level leatherworker villagers. Saddles also drop from mobs that are equipped with them, for example ravagers. Alternatively, you could find a strider that is pre-equipped with a saddle (see below).

Once you have those items, you have to find a strider. They can be found in the lava seas and lakes throughout the Nether. Because of this, you may have to bridge across a sea of lava to get to the strider. If you are in the endgame and have an elytra, you can fly to a body of lava and find some striders easily. Alternatively, you could attract them with warped fungus, but that works only in a short range.

Once you have a strider next to you, use the saddle on it—unless if there is baby strider on top of it, then you will have to choose a different strider. However, there is a 1 in 30 chance of a zombified piglin spawning riding a strider. This strider will have a saddle already equipped on it. If that is the case, try to kill the zombified piglin.

Afterwards, use the strider to ride it. Then, select the warped fungus on a stick. This lets you control the strider. When you use the warped fungus on a stick while riding your strider, it will boost the mount. This will use up one durability on your warped fungus on a stick. Once you have boosted the strider, you will be rewarded the advancement.

## Uneasy Alliance
Rescue a ghast from the Nether, bring it safely home to the Overworld... and then kill it

Requirements: Kill a ghast in the Overworld.

This is one of the most difficult advancements. Method described below is designed to be relatively easy to follow and reliable, at the cost of time spent, as it is definitely not the fastest.

The hardest part is getting the ghast through a nether portal. Ghasts spawn in three Nether biomes: soul sand valley, basalt deltas and nether wastes. Soul sand valley biomes are probably the best places to get a ghast, but keep in mind that the amount of skeletons might be dangerous. A better approach would be to go onto the Nether roof: see this tutorial for some methods to do so. Nether roof is a safer environment, and here it is much easier to control where mobs spawn, since by default they don't spawn on the roof at all, as they can't spawn on bedrock.

The next step is building a big nether portal: it must have at least 5×5 interior (7×7 with edges), but the bigger, the better. A maximum size nether portal is 21×21 interior (23×23 with edges). It is recommended that you choose a relatively flat area for this (again, nether roof is perfect!). Bottom edge of your portal should be at the same level as the ground, so that the ghast will not get stuck on it. If you use the roof method, you will have to build a platform around your portal, since you can't build inside bedrock. This platform should be built with fireball-proof material (e.g. cobblestone).

A method that is more time consuming, but also more reliable, involves blocking the spawning area off on all sides except that with the portal. The guard rails should be made out of bottom slabs, so the ghast won't spawn on top of the cage. Cage shown here has a 21×8 portal interior (23×10 with edges) and a 18×21 platform for spawning the ghast. Obviously, you can make it smaller or bigger, depending on how much resources and time you want to spend.

An example cage for ghast spawning
If for any reason you can't—or don't want to—go on the roof, the same cage can be built under the roof, it will just be less efficient since ghasts might spawn elsewhere instead.

After building the portal, light it up and go through yourself, to load the chunks on the other side. Check if the Overworld side has enough room for the ghast, as it can easily suffocate in walls. Making the portal on Overworld side bigger is not necessary, but might be helpful.

Go back to the nether and stand around 25-30 blocks away from the platform. Wait for the ghast to spawn. If you stand above the cage, a newly spawned ghast will not immediately target you. This process should take no more than few minutes if you built your setup on the roof, it may take quite a bit longer under the roof.

Few minutes later
Because ghasts move randomly, controlling them is very difficult, but this one should fly through the portal eventually just by chance. You can try to direct it into the portal by using fishing rods to pull the mob.

Once the ghast is in the Overworld, you will have to kill it: the easiest method for this is using a bow. Once you have successfully killed the ghast, you will be rewarded the advancement.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 100 experience.
