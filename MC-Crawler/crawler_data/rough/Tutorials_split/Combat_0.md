## Hostile mobs
There are many hostile mobs, including two bosses (the ender dragon and the wither) in the game. This list is sorted primarily by chance of encounter, with a few exceptions when appropriate, such as the listing of the illusioner, which does not spawn naturally, with it's fellow illagers.
It should be noted, however, that if caught in a difficult place without a weapon, the player can usually run away with little difficulty if they are outdoors, or even tunnel downward and wait for the mob to despawn before resurfacing to avoid combat. And, finally, should they so wish, the player can set the difficulty to Peaceful, which removes all hostile mobs, except for the ender dragon, shulkers, hoglins and piglins. Only the dragon keeps attacking the player on Peaceful.

### Overworld mobs
#### Zombies


See also: Zombie

Zombies are one of the easiest hostile mobs to kill, as they use only melee attacks and burn in sunlight (unless they are wearing helmets, carved pumpkins‌[Java Edition  only], or are in water), and it is easy to land a hit on them in melee combat without taking damage due to their slow speed and predictable movement. Zombies are not very fast (except for baby zombies, which sprint, are small, and, as a result, are hard to hit), and by themselves are merely a nuisance, although they can prove to be rather annoying in large numbers, or in dark, small spaces, like mines.

Zombies have 20 × 10 points of health and they deal 2.5 × 1.25 damage on Easy, 3 on Normal, and 4 on Hard. They also have 2 natural armor points (not counting any additional armor they might spawn with). 

As zombies are helpless when unable to reach the player, simply getting out of reach can nullify their threat. You can also use a bow to shoot zombies, but may wish to save their arrows for more difficult targets (unless the Infinity enchantment is applied).

One of the best ways to deal with a zombie horde or a baby zombie is to pillar up 2 blocks, so they can't reach you, but you can still reach them. This is not recommended if more dangerous mobs are around, as they may knock you off the pillar.

If possible, luring them out into sunlight causes them to burn.

Using a sword or axe with the Smite enchantment is a very effective option, as it is against all undead. Stone axe (or better) with Smite V kills unarmored zombies in one hit, without the need of criticals or Strength effect. Such axe kills in one hit even zombies with full iron armor (unenchanted) if a critical hit is performed.

Zombies transform into drowned when underwater for a long enough time. On Hard difficulty, they can spawn reinforcement zombies when players hit them, and can break down wooden doors. If playing on this difficulty, protecting ones house with something like an iron door or fence gate is advisable, as zombies can't break through those, although another option is having the base of the door one block higher than the block directly in front of it. 

Unlike most other hostile mobs, zombies have a detection range of 40 blocks, which means they'll see, and take action, against a player at a further distance than other mobs. This can be exploited to lure them out and dispatch them before dealing with more dangerous threats.
