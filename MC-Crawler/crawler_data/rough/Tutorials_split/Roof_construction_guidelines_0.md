## Roof scale
How big should a roof be? For inhabited buildings, a good guide is to make the roof between one and two stories tall. If a roof section does need to be much taller than that, consider making it into a tower, or use a mansard roof containing multiple floors.

The height of a roof can often be adjusted by changing its pitch or by adding a parapet and/or a roof-level walkway. Whenever there is enough volume under a roof for another building level, it would be quite unusual not to put in some extra rooms to take advantage.

For example, a building 20m wide with a single 45° gable roof would have a roof with a height of 10–11 blocks. Assuming 4–5 block stories, the roof would be 2–2½ stories high. At that size, it would be advisable either to put an extra floor inside the roof volume, or else split the roof into two or three smaller sections so that the rise per section is around 5–7 blocks. Alternatively, by adding a 1 block high parapet and a 1 block wide walkway around the roof, it is reduced to an apparent height of 7 blocks, which falls roughly within the rule of thumb for roof heights.

For some buildings, a spectacular roof is part of the design. For these 'monumental' buildings – such as churches – making all the internal spaces 'livable' is not a concern, and architectural and aesthetic considerations should take precedence.

## Roof height
Adjusting the height of a roof join.
These illustrations show the effect of adjusting the roof height of one section of a building relative to another. In the first picture, the main building has walls four blocks high and the side extensions have heights of two, four and six blocks. The white quartz steps mark the joining line between the main roof and the side roofs.

In the second picture, the side extension is almost a tower; it has a height of eight blocks relative to the parent building's four. The white quartz block marks the join as before, and the new sandstone bricks mark where the side extension's roof has been brought down to match the height of the main roof.

The final picture simplifies the join considerably by making the side extension into a tower.

## Roof pitch
As a real-world rule of thumb, the more precipitation an area receives, the steeper the pitch of roofs in that region. In Minecraft it is easy to get a roof pitch with an angle of 63.4°, 45° or 22.5° – just use double blocks for 63.4°, steps for 45° and alternate upper and lower slabs for 22.5°.

Note in the two 'roof pitch' diagrams how the width of the building significantly affects the look of the steepest roof. When using steeper roofs, or if you want a central 'feature' that is an odd number of blocks wide (such as a door) make the entire building an odd number of blocks wide. That way the roof will come to a point exactly over the central feature. If the center of your building is to have a double door or some other feature with an even width, then the building width should usually be even too.

Other roof pitches need more effort, and not every pitch will look good at every roof size. Try to use a repeating pattern of two or three blocks that generates roughly the right slope; for example, a sequence of slab, upside down stair, stair, slab, upside down stair, stair, rises five blocks vertically for every seven horizontally. As a general rule, the more complex the pattern, the bigger the roof you will need before you can use it.


## Large buildings
Once a building is larger than about 15×15 blocks, it will begin to look increasingly strange (or, at best, barnlike) if it continues to have a simple roof. Large buildings usually have multiple roofs in different sections. Think of an English manor house with two wings as a common example. Trying to place a single gable roof over a building like that is likely to look ridiculous. It's at this point that more elaborate roof designs begin to be needed. The following Wikipedia article lists common roof designs and often provides pictures and diagrams: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_roof_shapes
