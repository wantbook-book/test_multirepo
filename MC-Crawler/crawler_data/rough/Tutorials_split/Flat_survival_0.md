# Tutorials/Flat survival
Flat survival beyond mere subsistence is particularly challenging in Bedrock Edition because there are no structures and no materials to start with except for three layers of dirt with bedrock underneath. Java Edition players have several options for superflat worlds, but can simulate the flat world in Bedrock Edition for a unique extreme challenge.

## Equivalent challenge in Java Edition
Because there is only one kind of Flat world in Bedrock Edition, this tutorial is written from that perspective, but most of the information here applies to Java Edition also.

The flat world in Bedrock Edition has no structures, just one layer of bedrock, two layers of dirt, and one layer of grass block. That's all. The Java Edition "Classic Flat" world has villages by default. For a real challenge in Java Edition, turn off structure in the world generation option.

## Achievements and experience
In Bedrock Edition, achievements are disabled in flat survival, so it does not matter if you start out in Survival, or start out in Creative and switch to Survival. Starting out in Creative, you can set yourself up for the desired level of challenge by giving yourself a few items critical to survival.

You gain experience from killing mobs and doing other activities, but experience is not useful unless a mob happens to drop an item enchanted with Mending. It is highly unlikely for you to get enough iron to spare for an anvil, which requires experience to use.

## Planning your start
There are two ways to approach a flat world. One is with "some cheats" to give yourself some key resources before switching to Survival mode, and the other is to avoid any cheats and switch to Survival immediately, where you use the contents of a bonus chest.

### Some cheats
Players attempting a flat survival game often begin by giving themselves some minimal amount of resources at the start of the game, just enough to keep things challenging:

- Saplingsare needed for wood.Oakanddark oakalso provide apples, which can be eaten or saved for the possibility of curing a zombie villager much later.
	- This was considered amandatorycheat inJava EditionbeforeThe Village and Pillage Update(1.14).
	- InJava Edition, this cheat also provides parity with the Bedrock Edition "no cheats" bonus chest.

- 

- Because stone is not available, alava bucketand awater bucketallow you to make a cobblestone farm, allowing you to build afurnace(by woods for fuel) and solving nearly all building needs. Alava bucketis also your key to enteringthe Netheronce you getpointed dripstonefrom awandering traderto create more lava in acauldron, for makingobsidianfor anether portal. By using bottles from witches drop, you can fill the bottle and place it in a cauldron to make infinite water.
- For a greater challenge, starting with just alogand twoapplescan be enough to start, if you collect enough iron ingots from killingzombiesto make awater bucketand acauldron.

These are cheats, but because you can't earn achievements anyway in flat survival, do whatever you think would provide the most fun challenge.

### No cheats
Without buffing up your resources in creative first, create the world with a bonus chest in Survival mode. Do not to switch to Creative Mode. Play until you die or reach your goal, such as creating a village or making a base.

Your bonus chest contains some resources, and you have to work from this to survive and gain more resources.

At a minimum, your bonus chest should contain a sapling for Bedrock Edition. But saplings don't appear in Java Edition bonus chests, so you must have the bare minimum of 4 planks or a log and importantly at least 2 apples to make golden apple for getting villagers later.

Saplings in order of preference:

- Oakis easily sustainable and expandable into forests, and producesapples, crucial for getting villagers later.
- Spruceprovides a lot of wood and drops more saplings because it has more leaves than dark oak, but it doesn't drop apples.
- Dark oakrequires a minimum of four saplings to grow a tree. Dark oak trees also producesapplesand a lot of wood, but there is a risk of not dropping enough saplings for another tree, which effectively ends your game.
- Acaciais as sustainable as oak, producing about the same amount of wood and saplings, but doesn't produce apples and hard to mine down.
- Birchprovides the least amount of wood on the average, but it's common to get more than one sapling from a birch tree, so it's easy to create a birch forest. But birch doesn't produces apples.
- Junglehas the greatest risk of not dropping enough saplings for another tree, although it does provide a good quantity of wood like spruce.

If you get saplings for trees that don't drop apples, make sure to have at least 2 apples in your bonus chest.

Birch and oak grown near flowers can produce bee nests, which can be harvested once you get a campfire from a fisherman villager.

It is nice if your bonus chest includes a hoe but you can make one yourself using your wood.

There is no chance of ever getting lava without cheats. Lack of lava makes the challenge harder!
