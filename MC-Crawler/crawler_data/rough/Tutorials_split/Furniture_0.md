# Tutorials/Furniture
This article describes different pieces of furniture you can construct in Minecraft. Note that the majority of these are just for decoration, with the exception of beds and bookshelf blocks (bookshelves enhance enchanting tables in the vicinity). This tutorial is merely decorative and will enhance the look of your house. You can make it more functional. For example, a fridge could hold food in a way so the block holding the food is accessible. Or, a fireplace can be used as an item incinerator. Try coming up with ways to incorporate uses into furniture.

## Bedroom furniture
The most essential piece to a bedroom is the bed. Once you've placed a bed, you can start decorating your bedroom with furniture. Dressers, desks, and bookshelves are the basic furniture you can put in your bedroom.

To make a barricaded door or window, use signs and put them against doors or windows as pieces of wood then type dashes on.



### Dressers
A dresser is a stack of double chests. An idea for a more interesting home is to have themed chests with only certain things (e.x. Only store armor in the dresser). You can place item frames next to the dressers to show the items inside. Craftable clothing isn't available in Vanilla Minecraft, so most players put armor in their dressers. If this is the case, place a few armor stands down to show off your newly crafted armor.

If you don't want to waste wood on chests/need dressers for a real purpose, but still want them for decoration, you can make a dresser that looks like real life, but is not functional in Minecraft, and does not cost much wood, as it is made of wood planks. Place two wood planks next to each other on the floor, and place two above that. Then, put trapdoors, buttons, or signs with the letter O on all 4 blocks.

### Closets
Here is a design for a cool and interactive closet that is simple to make. 
You will need: 

- 4stairs
- 2doors
- 2trapdoors

Place the blocks like this (the grid is from the side view):

Then, place the doors over it so they look like the double doors, with the handles closest to each other. You could also add trapdoors either side of the stairs.

### Cabinets
Here is how to make a simple cabinet.

- 1 of any type of block (bookshelves are preferable, because it gives the illusion of food or dinnerware within.)
- 2 trapdoors

Place the block against a wall. Then, place one trapdoor on top of the block and one on the front side. If desired, place multiple blocks with trapdoors next to each other, for a bigger cabinet.

### Bunk Bed
For the bunk bed, you need a wall that has at least a width of 4 and a height of 4. 

Get fences and place them each on the outer rim of the wall, and then place wood planks in the wall spaces on the bottom only. Place a bed on top of the two blocks. Next, get rid of the blocks under the bed and then place a bed where those blocks were. However, note that the top bed will not change your spawn point unless there is a solid block with two empty blocks above it one block below the bed and directly adjacent and you will wake up on top of the bed, so there needs to be more than one block of space above the bed.

You can also make a bunk bed with two doors and two beds. Put two blocks of any type in a row, and then place a bed on top. Break the two blocks. Then, place a bed under the top bed. Finally, put the two doors on the side.

This final design for a bunk bed requires a wall that is 3Ã—3, and you will need 6 fences and 2 beds. First, place two stacks of fences, 3 blocks high each, with 2 blocks in between them. Then, place the first bed on the floor, the second on the 3rd fence, and you're finished!

### Bookshelves
To make a bookshelf, stack as many bookshelf blocks as you desire. You can also use slabs and stairs stacked on top of each other to simulate normal shelves. The back of looms can be used to look like empty shelves among the books. This design is simple, but pretty!
