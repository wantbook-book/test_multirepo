### Fisherman
One of the less useful professions, it is really only useful for selling fish that you obtain from fishing sessions or from an AFK Fish Farm. While it buys string and coal, it asks for relatively high quantities, and you can sell these items to other professions. Level them up with the fish trades.

A few advantages about fishermen still exist: First, they have the cheapest coal trade compared to other coal-trading professions (10:1 instead of 15:1), so it can be useful if the player has a lot of coal from mining or killing wither skeletons. Buckets of cod can be obtained, so you don't have to go mining for iron. Second, all four types of fish they buy can be farmed in large quantities, with tropical fish and pufferfish having the better deals among the four. Third, they buy one boat for one emerald, a reasonably good deal. The boat trade is cheaper compared to the Fletcher's sticks to emerald trade in terms of wood planks (5:1 instead of 16:1), so you don't have to chop a lot of trees. You only need 15 logs to get 12 emeralds compared to 64 logs for 16 emeralds.

Nothing useful or unique can be bought from fishermen; the offers can all be easily obtained by other means.

### Fletcher
This profession is useful in obtaining emeralds, as they buy sticks, which are easy to get. In addition, if you do not have Infinity on your bow, you can buy lots of arrows for a relatively cheap price. If you max them out, you can get hard-to-obtain tipped arrows, as well. If you want them, level the villager up with sticks or buy a bunch of bows/crossbows unless you can afford the other trades.

If you encounter a village or an igloo with basement in early game, one of the most beneficial things you can do is to convert a villager to a fletcher, sell it sticks, and buy bow and arrows from it. this allows you to perform ranged attacks frequently, without the worry of running out of arrows. To achieve the same results, you either have to meticulously set up a chicken farm, get really lucky to find a skeleton spawner, or wait until you can get Infinity on your bow.

### Leatherworker
This profession is really only useful for obtaining saddles, since leather armor is weak, and the player is likely going to keep most of their leather for crafting books and item frames. It is recommended to level it up with leather unless you can afford the later trades. However, since saddles are not stackable, and the player does not usually need a large quantity of saddles, it can be argued whether this profession is really worth it.

### Librarian
This is one of the most important professions late-game, as it allows you to obtain almost every enchantment, including treasure enchantments, with the exception of Soul Speed and Swift Sneak. In addition, it buys paper, books, and ink sacs, all of which farmable, giving a good source of emeralds. This allows you to get perfect enchanted gear, although it requires a lot of XP to add the enchantments on an anvil. In addition, it takes a while before you get the enchantment you need for each villager. There is no need to level them up unless you need name tags, or a higher chance of obtaining an enchanted book in which case level them up with the latest available trade.

### Stone mason
This villager is useful for obtaining emeralds, as you can trade it stone (not cobblestone) and clay, especially if you have a stone generator and a Silk Touch pickaxe or if you have a clay farm or a lush cave nearby. Otherwise, you can sell them nether quartz, extra andesite, granite, and diorite that you picked up from a mining session, or buy quartz blocks for a large build. Level them up with the stone trade unless you have a lot of the stone variant to trade away. In Bedrock Edition, you need three masons to trade away each type of stone.

Masons also offer a renewable source of bricks, terracotta, and glazed terracotta. In version 1.17, they also sell dripstone blocks, which are pretty hard to find or farm.

### Shepherd
This profession does not sell anything valuable, but it can buy wool and dyes as a good source of emeralds. There is no need to level it up. The player can have automatic wool farms and flower farms to allow for trading with shepherds.

### Toolsmith
This profession is also a must, since you can obtain diamond tools and bells. Also, if you plan on using a diamond hoe, try to get a villager that sells you one, too. Like the armorer, level it up using iron.

### Weaponsmith
This profession is important because you can obtain diamond axes and diamond swords easily, in addition to bells. Level it up with iron, as well.
