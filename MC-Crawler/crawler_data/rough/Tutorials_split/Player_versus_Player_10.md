In these 3 kits, players are given usually 2 stacks of XP bottles. Now beginners might just use down a whole stack of bottles to repair their gear but this is wrong. 

Before repairing, make sure to back off way before your armor breaks (preferably when your helmet/boots dips to below 70 durability). Use XP bottles to heal your armor if it gets low. If your shield has mending, all the XP will go to healing your shield, so take off your shield while doing this. (Shields don't take enough damage to fully break during a fight, normally.) XP bottles heal all your armor evenly, but your armor has different amounts of durability. Your helmet will break while your chestplate still has 1/3 durability. XP bottles only heal armor pieces that you are wearing, though. Take off everything but your helmet and heal it to 100% durability. Now put on your boots and heal them to 80%. Now take them off and heal your leggings to 75%, and then chestplate to 70% durability. Also, make sure you're not too close to your enemy while repairing, since they can get free hits on you, wasting your bottles.

## Playstyle
It's extremely important to know how to play and when. Knowing how to deal more damage than your opponent is necessary, but you have to be able to chain your manuevers and gameplay together to really press your advantages and turn a mess of hitting things into a cohesive playstyle. First we'll examine the two most basic playstyles, playing Defensively or Offensively, and how to counter those playstyles.

#### Defensive
The most common playstyle in SMPs, a defensive playstyle involves constantly keeping a little between your opponent and playing reactionarily. You will be playing slow and winning by Armor Drain, steadily but surely. This playstyle is very effective against players that seem to have good aim and fast mechanics, but have worse strategy and might be too eager to rush into things. This is how to pull it off using your kit.

- Open trades with KB hits (main the KB1 sword). Back away when they run or jump at you or use Crit Deflections, seeing if you can bait them into missing or getting into a bad position. This also can discourage them from rushing you too hard.
- The main purpose of your shield is to protect you from damage or save you from scary situations.
- Abuse Autohitting and Shield Sacrificing to get in a free KB hit. Back away and trade KB hits. Some players when they break your shield are desperate to follow up, so see if they expose themselves to a bait and punish them for it. Pearling away when your shield is disabled is also a good idea sometimes when playing defensively.
- Try to get the first hit in an exchange. Doing this will make it so you can back out of trades and escape while still up a hit.
- Make sure you heal your armor safely and correctly. This is always very much true, but if you throw your armor durability, this playstyle is useless.

#### Countering Defensive Players
Defensive players need two things: they need to be able to run away from you, and they need to safely survive to drain your resources.

- First, just play calm against them. Understand that they are going to be constantly trying to bait you, so don't make stupid aggressive moves if they could dodge out of it. Play very aggressively if you have an opportunity to punish them; once you get very close they might crumble.
- Play aggressive on a shield break. Be absolutely sure you use a technique from the Aggressive playstyle to stop them from running or hitting you away, to force them to fight you. Close to you with their shield down is the single worst situation for a defensive player to be in. Pearl after them when their shield breaks if you have to!
- Pearlchase your opponent if they are low. This gives you free hits when the heal and applies lots of pressure, and can give an opportunity to drop your opponent.
- Utilize every tactic you can to drop your opponent.

#### Aggressive
An aggressive playstyle is constantly pushing your opponent, never allowing more than a short break. It mostly relies on being able to play faster than your opponent, making them panic or forcing them into bad decisions. You are often able to drop your opponent when they can't escape your quick damage. It requires strong mechanical skill and versatility with melee mechanics.

- You rarely want to knock your opponent very far, or take KB much yourself. The No-KB sword will see a lot of use. Use No-KB crits, Pcrits, shielding, and jump resetting as much as possible so stay on them and allowing yourself to crit them constantly, dealing damage as fast as possible.
- Your shield is primarily for preventing knockback. If you are able to stay close to your opponent without being deflected or comboed, your crits will do all the rest. Blocking their much lower damage output isn't as important as continuing to crit them out.
- Make sure to follow up on shield breaks as much as possible with crit chains. Use No-KB stuns (a No-KB crit with an axe to disable their shield) and Single Click Disables (only click their shield once to not deal extra knockback) so that you are close to them once their shield is down.
- Keep a health advantage at all times so that you can afford to rush the other player at any moment and not worry about healing yourself. A lot of value will come by pushing your opponent when they need to heal; getting very close to them and spamming your shield so that they don't have an effective way to escape to heal.

#### Countering Aggressive
Aggressive players want to disable your shield and catch you in a bad situation to crit you out. You're gonna need to react to all they're doing and avoid getting dropped at all costs.

- Adopting a very defensive playstyle is the most simple counter. Just bait them and punish them for their most aggressive moves to take the edge off of it. However, use your shield sparingly and cautiously unless you have a plan for if it gets disabled.
- Disabling their shield is a very important part of countering this playstyle, as otherwise all your attempts to hit them away can be blocked. Without a shield they are easy to crit deflect and combo.
- Instead of pearling out when low, pearl out when you won't be punished for it. If you get some distance from them, that's a safe time to heal you should capitalize on.
- You can use backstabs or sidesweeps occasionally. This relies on the fact that they constantly push into you as hard as they can to stop you from running, so switching playstyles and running into them will surprise them and they won't be in a good situation to counter it.
