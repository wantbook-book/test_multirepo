## Block jumping
Block jumping is similar to pillaring and also referred to as "block glitching", which is an easy way of traveling upwards. By block jumping, the player can easily reach very high places by jumping and placing a block underneath the player's feet while airborne. Block jumping is a form of glitch movement involving high connection pings or high lag rate, and is used as pillaring on multiplayer mode in areas the player cannot build in.

On most servers, there are protected areas in which the player cannot build or destroy. However, players can still reach high places in these areas by placing a block under themselves and quickly jumping off before it disappears. This can be repeated as long as the connection ping is high enough or the client's lag is high enough. A better way of block jumping that even works on servers with a very low ping is to jump next to a wall and place a block on the wall. By quickly jumping and placing blocks one after another in front of the player, they will be able to bypass the build protection used in servers. Using this way, the block the player is going to place is not contingent on the previously placed block.

This glitch is often used to complete challenges such as "jumping puzzles" to achieve false accomplishment and steal a prize or reward that was intended for a legitimate player. When a player attempts this glitch they are sometimes noticed and appropriate consequences may occur.

Most servers run anti-cheat plugins and most of these will detect block jumping as flying and will kick the player from the server or report the player to an admin. It is also not allowed on most servers and is referred to as an exploit by some players.
