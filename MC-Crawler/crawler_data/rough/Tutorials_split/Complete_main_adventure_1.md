## Step 1: Building the nether portal
After you have played in a Minecraft world for a while, hopefully, you have acquired at least four iron ingots along the way, whether you smelted them or found them in a chest. You will need to craft three of the ingots into at least one bucket that will be used to create obsidian for a nether portal. The only other way to make a nether portal without buckets involves mining already-created obsidian with a diamond pickaxe. Acquire a piece of flint, as well.

The easiest way to make a nether portal without a diamond pickaxe:

1) With your iron, craft a bucket. One bucket is all you need, but the more buckets you have, the more efficient this job is going to be.

2) Fill a bucket with lava. If you have more than one, fill all but one with lava, and the last one with water.

3) Make the shape below using dirt and lava. (note that these are all top view)

4) Place water over the lava blocks. The lava should have turned to obsidian. If it turned to cobblestone, then the lava was flowing and not a solid source block. Break the cobblestone, put lava in it and try again. It should work this time.

5) Place on the top of the previous blocks following:

6) Place water over the two lava blocks.

7) Do step 5 and 6 two times more on top of the current layer.

8) Finish the top with a shape similar to the bottom.

 9) Remove all dirt blocks. From the side, it should look something like this.

10) Make a flint and steel with your flint and iron and use it to light the portal.

## Step 2: The Nether
See Nether Survival

First of all, gear up. The Nether is dangerous, especially with all the lava and the creepy hostile mobs. Pack away anything unrelated to weapons and food. 

Screenshot from the Nether.
Equip yourself with following items:

- 2 stacks withcobblestoneor other block withBlast Resistanceover 4
- A full set of iron armor
- A piece of golden armor (boots or helmet are recommended) to defend yourself againstpiglins
- An iron or diamondsword
- Abowand arrows (if using Infinity enchantment only one arrow is necessary)
- Iron or diamond pickaxe
- A stack ofsteakorcooked porkchop, or another good food.
- Golden apples(optional) for emergency healing
- Shieldsare recommended to deflect damage.
- If possible,potions of Fire Resistanceto defend fire damage (extremely rare in the Overworld; only available from killing witches)

A nether fortress. Search for blazes and other useful items in this structure.
Raiding The Nether

- Enterthe Netherby standing in your portal. Don't forget to bring a flint and steel!
- Look around. Familiarize yourself with the surroundings. Watch out forghastsand other hostile mobs. Watch out for falling lava and holes in the nether landscape. Attention: If you have just begun this world and you are not familiar with many things of the Nether,do notgo on. Head back and do more mining.
- Explore the Nether until you find someblazes. This requires finding anether fortressas blazes do not spawn elsewhere. Each fortress can have up to two blazespawnersin them. Make sure to mark your trail so you can find your way back. It would be a good idea to usecobblestone, because ghasts cannot destroy it. If you need resistant building blocks and are running out of cobblestone, smelting somenetherrackfor craftingnether brickscan be a good idea, or if you are nearbasalt deltasbiome, usingblackstoneorbasaltcan be good too.
- Defeat them until you have at least tenblaze rods. The reason for that is that you will need at least 2 of those for findingthe End. Itishard. The rest are for fixing the end portal and brewing. This task would be made easier if you had apotionof Fire Resistance, which requires 2 rods to craft abrewing standand fuel for it.
- Craft all the blaze rods except one intoblaze powder. The intact blaze rod is used for a brewing stand.
- Along the way, be sure to try and kill anywither skeletonsthat you may come across if you plan on later killing the wither.
- Try to findnether quartz oreandglowstone, if you like to useredstone.
- Try to get as much netherite as you can later on, as it is a very useful tool and armor material.

## Step 3: Finding a stronghold
- Obtain at least 15ender pearlsusing methods described above.
- Craft these ender pearls with theblaze powderintoeyes of ender.
- Throw one of your eyes of ender. You do this by right clicking in Java Edition.
- The eye of ender should fly up in the air. Follow it and when it falls down pick it up, do not throw another eye until you are at least 1400 blocks away from (0,0) as strongholds can't generate any closer. Then throw eye each 250 blocks until the eye changes direction, meaning that the stronghold is now behind you. Continue to throw eyes until one points downwards. If an eye breaks, use another one.
- Donotdig directly down where theeye of enderenters. There is the risk of falling into the pit oflavaunder the end portal. Other potential methods of going down are staircase mining and attempting to find acavethat leads into thestronghold. InBedrock Edition, if the eye of ender goes into the ground atvillageor close, just dig under the well and lead you to entrance of stronghold.
- You will come to a stronghold. Search for the room with the end portal.
- In the room there is a square made out of end portal blocks. Be careful. There is asilverfishspawner in every end portal room. This spawner is best destroyed. You can preserve it if you like (it can make a goodXP farmandmining tool) but it is easiest for your health to destroy it. Some of theend portal blockshave eyes of ender in the top. Right click on the ones which don't have an eye of ender. This will consume the eye of ender. Do this on all the blocks that do not already have eyes of ender. Anend portalshould form. But don't jump in yet!
- Go back to your base to prepare for the ender dragon fight. Get all your best gear and weapons.
- When you are ready, go back to the stronghold and jump in.
