# Tutorials/Best biomes to play
There are many biomes in Minecraft. Some are easier and harder to live in depending on the availability of food, wood, and other resources. Some biomes may have variants that can be easier or harder to live in.

## The Overworld
The player first spawns in the Overworld where resources such as wood, food, and stone are plentiful in most biomes. However, some biomes lack certain resources or have terrain that makes it harder to survive in.

Below are various types of biomes players can encounter:

### Forest
Forests and birch forests are common biomes, likely to be where you spawn in. As a rather basic biome, living in or near one is recommended for new players. Dark Forests should be considered as a more extreme version of the normal Forest that happens to contain the coveted woodland mansions.

Pros:

- Many trees provide a large amount of wood
- Animals are plentiful
- Wolves spawn in the normal variant, providing an animal to tame
- Generally temperate, giving equal access to more varied biomes
- Varied flowers generate, especially in the Flower Forest variant
- Beehivesspawn on trees rarely
- Trail ruinsspawn in the old growth birch Forest variant

Cons:

- Trees can make it hard to traverse, especially for the normal variant
- Lack of any surface structures and repetitive generating makes it easy to get lost in
- Trees provide shade for mobs to hide under during the day
- Land requires clearing to make way for structures
- Dark forests have overall thicker trees, meaning all of the above problems are worsened by living in one

### 
Plains as well as meadows are common biomes characterized by grassy, flat terrain and plentiful bees. It is recommended to live here for many reasons. The savanna can be seen as a variant of the plains biome that has llamas and more trees at the cost of being hotter. 

Pros: 

- Flat terrain allows high visibility, easy navigation and easier building
- Beehivesare found often, especially in meadows
- Wide variety offlowers, rarer ones spawning in mass in meadows
- Animalsare plentiful here
- Villagesgenerate commonly, providing massive amounts offoodand access to the invaluablevillagerswithin

Cons:

- Grass may block attacks while in combat
- Nights have many mobs due to the lack of trees
- Many resources have to be imported from different regions due to the lack of variety

### Taiga
Taigas and their old growth taiga variants provide a similar, yet distinct experience from normal forests. If you're looking for a different kind of play, this is the way to go.

Pros:

- Spruce treesaren't nearly as movement inhibiting as the trees in Forests, along with giving unfathomable amounts of wood if placed in a 2 by 2 formation
- Sweet berriesspawn here, providing a weak, yet plentifulfood
- Villages generate in the normal variant, often generating withiron armorfor the taking
- Grass color is unique, which is often desirable
- The old growth variants always generate withlush cavesbelow them
	- This also meansazalea treesare easy to get
- This is one of the only biomes wherefoxesspawn, along with its similar snowy variant

Cons:

- Like the forest, it's still rather hard to traverse and requires flattening to use.
- Due to it being a cold biome, warmer biomes such asdesertsandjunglesare further than usual
- If you aren't careful, you might accidentally walk into a sweet berry bush
- Trees are often too tall to cut without placing more blocks
	- The giant trees can be cut easily by digging a staircase up the middle and destroying the staircase on the way down, but still poses a risk of falling off and taking fataldamage.

### Jungle
Jungles and their variants from a glance might seem to be one of the best places to live. However, many factors add up for it to be an unpleasant experience to those who try, mostly pertaining to the foliage.

Pros:

- Many varied resources are near exclusively found here, such asbambooandcocoa beans
- Tons of wood can be found everywhere here
- Jungle pyramidscan be found here, providing shelter and decent loot
- Ocelotsandparrotscan be found here
- The lime grass color is highly desirable to most
- Warmer biomes such as deserts andbadlandsare closer by

Cons:

- The foliage is too dense for any constructions to be made in a timely manner
	- Fires are a legitimate issue due to this, compared to most biomes where it can be ignored safely
- Traveling is hard due to the varied terrain and high foliage
- Mobs can easily be found roaming during the day
- Deep chasms can be obscured by the foliage until it's too late
- Due to it being a warm biome, colder areas are disproportionally farther away
- Decayingjungle leaveshave only a 2.5% chance to drop saplings (compared to the normal 5%), making it less renewable

### Snowy biomes
On the cold extreme, the snowy plains and other associated biomes like ice spikes might surprise some with their difficulties. Since temperature largely isn't a problem, this biome plays out similar to the plains and taiga. Due to this, many of the downsides are not listed since it's the same as the aforementioned biomes.

Pros:

- One of the few places wherepolar bearsspawn, providing emergency food or something simple for mob collectors
- Watercan be frozen intoicerenewably here, whilesnowandpowder snowcan be farmed here too
- Rivers are frozen over, making boat travel much faster on them
- Villages can spawn here, their cold version containing more wood in the buildings and some unique architecture.
- Igloosspawn, allowing players to set up villages manually

Cons:

- Because it's as cold as can be here, warm biomes are usually unreasonably far away
- The snow often requires builds to be covered instringto prevent them from being snowed on
- Because water is frozen, all open water must be covered to prevent it from freezing
	- An alternative is to use standardtorcheswithin a 3-block radius to keep ice from freezing
- Animals are scarce, often requiring them to be imported or have other food sources such as fromfarms
