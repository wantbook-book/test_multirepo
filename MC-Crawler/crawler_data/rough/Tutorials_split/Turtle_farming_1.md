## Managing the farm
The eggs hatch after a few day-night cycles. After the turtles hatch for the first time, you're basically done. As each baby turtle grows up, it drops a scute and leaves. You can accelerate their growth by feeding them sea grass. The turtles eventually return on their own to your farm to lay more eggs.

A turtle farm works while you're away from the keyboard (AFK). Many in-game days are required to hatch enough baby turtles to create a sizable population of turtles laying eggs in your farm, but you can speed things up by actively managing your farm, using sea grass to lure back the turtles who left, feeding sea grass to pairs of turtles, and feeding baby turtles.

You can modify the barrier by installing a gate made from trapdoors under the barrier. The trapdoors can be operated manually, or you can lay a line of redstone dust on top of the barrier with a lever somewhere to power all the trapdoors at once. This can be used to keep adult turtles from leaving until you have fed them and got them to mate. A pregnant turtle needs to return to the water before returning to the beach to lay eggs. She may do this by returning to the water in the farm, and you might need to attract her back out onto the beach with seagrass. Otherwise, let them leave the farm and you can induce them to re-enter it later. A pregnant turtle fits under the trapdoors when open.

If you venture away from your farm further than the despawn range (128 blocks in Java Edition, 44-128 blocks in Bedrock Edition depending on simulation distance), the turtles in the farm despawn if you have not interacted with them by offering them seagrass.

If you wish to have the turtles leave the farm area, you can add temporary slab (to each module) to the right of the current slab. However, place it on the bottom of that block rather than the top, to provide a staircase of sorts. Only do this when you have all adult turtles in the farm, and go to the outside with some seagrass to attract them to the outside. Once they've left, remove the temporary slabs, to prevent future baby turtles from also escaping on them.
