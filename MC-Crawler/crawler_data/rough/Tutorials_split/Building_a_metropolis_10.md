### More ideas
Here are more ideas for a metropolis that do not fit any of the previously mentioned categories.

- Alliance

An alliance is composed of several cities that agree to protect each other and allow each other to put military forces into each other’s territory. They also agree to not attack each other. When a treaty is signed an alliance forms. Other cities can join or leave an alliance.

- Building contestHold a contest where the players build structures. The structures can be pretty much anything, ranging from houses andflying machinestopixel art. Include various prizes, such as rare blocks, and make sure to have a few judges. (At least two are recommended). After it's over, winners' entries stay up (and, if you have WorldEdit orstructure blocks, you can even move them somewhere else), while the losers' entries can be taken down using whatever method you like, such as TNT. If you need to build an important building, like city hall or central railway station, you can host a design competition where the winning design gets built or is moved to the right place with WorldEdit or structure blocks.

- CarpenterHave a carpentry where you can purchase expansions onto your house, as well as have houses built or destroyed. Make the currency to purchase not too cheap, but not too expensive, for example, 5 emeralds for a room 5×9, or whatever you decide. Another example could be 10emeraldsfor a 12×12 garage with a fully openable door withredstone. Or you can do other things like making the price cheaper, if they give the carpenter some items to build with, if not free, if all needed items are given.

- Deadly labyrinthUse the general maze building idea but only add lethal traps and dangerous mobs. Add viewing windows and station armed and armored guards at each exit and window. Only throw criminals and griefers in. Make the walls as strong as possible.
	- Ideas: Add mobs, bounty hunters and guards and turn it into a "game". Relatives of the criminals can send in healing potions and food and other supplies. If (somehow) they survive then either
		1. Give them a reprieve OR,
		2. Make them fight in the arena

- DefenseDon't let the monsters take over the city! Make sure you have walls around your metropolis. You can put cacti on top of the wall to keepspidersout. You can also add archer towers if you want. Just make a 3×3 square on the wall with ladders to get up to them. Add moats withlavafor the death of your enemies. Just be creative!

- Delivery serviceDeliver things from the distribution center to where they are requested or to the player who requests them. If you have a distribution center, then this is a must have. Use pistons to push chests plus some buttons and a player or a road made out of redstone blocks if you are in Bedrock Edition, a player/some players that put the items from the chest that has the sign that indicates who/where requested the items into their inventory and then bring them to the place/player that requested them. Then the requested items are put in another chest within a chosen amount of blocks of the player’s bed, where the place/player that requested them wants them to be where a chest is or near the entrance/near one of the entrances of the house that the player is in. If there is no chest that is under any of these conditions, they build one that meets any of the conditions.

- FactionsMake factions for small groups like warriors, miners, lumberjacks, knights, farmers, et cetera.

- Field tripHold field trips for the kids at school! You can take them to a museum, or even pay a visit to a nearby village and give them a small lesson on trading.

- Fire hydrantIn every important building, put awater bucketin anitem frame, so that if a fire somehow starts it can be removed simply by a right-click.

- Fireworks showUse a bunch ofredstone,dispensers, and different types offireworksto make a special firework show!

- Foreign tradeMake a foreign trade where only the government workers are able to trade out some of the tax "money" they receive to purchase items not available in their region.

- GamesBuild an area where players can play games.

- Historical districtMake this part of your city more historical such as medieval buildings, Victorian buildings, any old fashioned era you can think of! Make sure there's a good few museums around here. You can even go back to the time of the Neanderthals!

- HolidaysHave special days to celebrate. They can be real or fictional, just have fun!

- Interior designNobody wants to live in a house without furniture! In every house you build (you should end up building a lot of them), add special furniture. Usepistonsorfenceswithpressure platesfor tables,stairsandsignsfor chairs, andbookshelvesto decorate your houses. Try making a computer with aniron blockand apainting, plusredstoneand aleverto be a mouse.

- Law enforcementAdd a set law enforcement such as regular police, the FBI or the CIA, for example. Make the tasks as in real life. Regular police patrol streets and do normal desk work, the FBI do even more desk work and some light crime investigation, and the CIA does most of the crime investigation.

- Mob of honorWhy not have amobthat your city honors? Choose any animal or monster to pay tribute to. You can hold festivals, build statues and memorials, or you can even make the citizens in your city that kind of mob!

- National parkClose off an area of your metropolis and leave it how it is, with various  biomes, mobs and structures. Make a "Leave No Trace" rule here so that players are not allowed to alter the area, so if they do not follow it, they are punished.  While constructing your national park, make cabins for guests to stay in, with a few bedrooms, a bathroom, a living room, a kitchen, a balcony, etc., and usegravelroads to connect them. If there is a stronghold located within your national park, you can dig down until you get to the stronghold and then addladdersorstairsso people can get there. It is also advised to activate theEnd Portal. National parks can also be made inThe NetherorThe End

- Nether accessBuild anether portaland let people get to theNether. Even better, if it spawns you right next to anether fortress, then you can make a tour and block off dead ends. Or just make anetherrackmine. Build a nether-style building around the portal so people can easily see where it is. Cannot be made inThe Endor Nether cities, consider "Overworld Access" there.

- Olympic gamesBuild a massive stadium with different racing and hurdles event where contestants can compete against each other in various sports such as archery or minigames.

- Parkour areaTest your parkour skills out! Place hard-to-jump to blocks, and place them in random areas. Also, make more challenges, like nausea for the whole course.

- Pest patrolWhen annoyingmobsinvade, call the pest patrol! Remember to include tamedwolves, tamedocelots, iron andsnow golems. Don't forget weapons andarmor! Have achestfor them to put mob drops in.

- Pet showFor all pets. Have events like cats scaringcreepersinto a pit, and wolves killing as many mobs as they can. Warning: The animals might die, so be careful! Make sure to heal them between rounds.

- PlaygroundSquare off an area and build a jungle-gym for the little ones! This creation can include slides,ladders, bridges, huts, and other things like that. Be creative! Also, make sure you build a sitting area for the parents to relax!

- ProtocolsHave protocols! Invite your citizens to the protocol and talk about government changes, e.g., higher taxes.

- Public parkSet aside a large grassy area with lots of trees. A lake or a river would look nice, so try to build it near one of these. If players are caught dropping unwanted items on the ground, charge a fee for littering. Fountains, statues and other decorative things can be used to make it more attractive.

- RacesThis would be an arena that is long and has seating on the sides (they could be going up like a slope) dig a 1+ block deep canal in the middle and have it at least 5 to 6 blocks wide. Fill it withwatersource blocks. Put some turns and obstacles in it and you can haveboatraces! You can even use ice in boat races! Or, instead of using water/ice, keep it dry and race onpigsor on foot, with speedpotionsin the latter case. You can also use horses for the race.

- RedstoneBuild weird mechanisms withredstonein your buildings or make areas full of them that makes your city look more advanced. You can do things such as wiring all the buildings, so they have electric lighting. Or make a clock tower, or track your resident's movements, or have streetlamps that turn on at night.

- ReligionYou can make up your own religion that you want your citizens to follow. This religion can include myths and legends about things, such as theender dragon!

- Rubbish binsIn the streets of your city, you could have chests simulating rubbish bins. You could addhoppersbeneath and add a water flow orminecart, so it goes to a disposal center orlava.

- Save the mobsWhen passive mobs invade the streets, call a group to keep mobs from making traffic jams and put those mobs in a farm where they belong. Better established if a group would previously dispose of other mobs killing the passive mobs.

- Spawn baseBuild a big building as a spawn building for people to spawn in. Put a gate, command give items, and city law and rules to show to newer players to the city.

- StoryMake your city have a secret backstory, some hidden evil lurking in the darkness, and maybe even recruit some players on a server to role-play for the citizens of the city. At some point, the citizens may have to go into a battle against the Dark Lord or some other monster army. Make sure to add lots of detail and make it exactly as you imagine it to be!

- TrainingMake a massive training area that teaches the player every single trick in the book of Minecraft. Fromsplash potionjumping, to sniping with thebowandarrow. If you think that the player is experienced (both in terms of skill and actualXP points) enough, then it is possible you can recruit them for a guard.

- TreatiesTreaties are agreements signed between 2 or more cities that change some things, end some things, ban some things, transfer things, and/or allow things. They are either in a book or on signs. They can be long. Beware when signing it as it can be broken.

- WarBuild forts, bunkers and wage war against castles full of traps, monsters (creepersare not recommended), other players, challenges, or other cities. BuildTNTcannons, build an army, and build a navy.

Award loyal soldiers with positions like general or lieutenant.

- Weapons licenseIn a peaceful city, players shouldn't be running around murdering people! You can set up a system where anybody holding a weapon without a license is thrown in jail. Set a price and expiration date and only let trusted citizens own them.

- WMD labYou can use this as an animal breeding ground or assembly base. Make a big, multi-level building, addiron doorsand branch off into smaller labs. Add crazy experiments and (if legal) you can use POW's (prisoners of war) as test subjects. Make sure there are no windows. Security is likely to be tight.

- World war

Same as war, but much more intense, with most/all cities at war, plus air forces added. Be careful as lag machines might be made by the losing side/sides in an attempt to force the winning side/sides to agree on their terms but they also threaten to drop the frames per second and maybe even the ticks per second to near 0 or at 0. This may mean that the server could crash due to the ticks per second being pushed to 0. So be careful and only allow it if you are willing to risk the server crashing due to lag machines.
