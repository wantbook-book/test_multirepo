# Tutorials/Experience farming
Experience is a tricky resource:  It is needed for enchanting, combining and repairing items, and for fueling the Mending enchantment.  Many desired jobs require large amounts of experience — but it can take quite a while to accumulate a high experience level, and when the player dies, they lose essentially all of their current stock.  Accordingly, many players resort to "experience farming" — arranging a situation where they can pick up large amounts of experience when desired.  These fall into several categories, reflecting the many sources of experience, but most of them can be considered in terms of experience per time — either active or AFK time, with the player involved, or "accumulation" time before collecting the results.

Consulting the Experience page, we can see several common "target values" for desired experience payouts:

## Contents
- 1 Fishing
- 2 Trading
- 3 Mob grinder
- 4 Spawner XP farm
- 5 Quartz mining
- 6 Enderman XP farm
- 7 Gold XP farm
- 8 Guardian farm
- 9 Smelters
- 10 Ender dragon
- 11 Sculk farm

## Fishing
Fishing can function as a slow experience farm, with only two string and three sticks as an "entrance" fee to get started.  However, it is wise to set up a secure fishing pond:  You'll want a stretch of water at least two blocks deep and a few across (basically big enough not to accidentally miss the water). If you want to fish for treasure you must have a body of water large enough to extend at least 5 blocks around the bobber and 4 blocks deep.

The water should be open to the sky, but you should have a lit, sheltered area to fish from, with a roof to fend off phantoms, and fences or glass to keep monsters from spotting and targeting you (a bit of height helps too). You should also make sure that you can reach the fishing area when it's night or storming, and that you can quickly climb back up if you happen to fall into the water.  You need at least one double-chest to store your catches (and your rod, when not in use).

Fishing with any rod can catch enchanted fishing rods, which can be saved until a rod with Mending is caught. This rod can be combined (at an anvil) with other rods as they are caught, and fishing becomes essentially free. The goal is to produce a "god rod", with (Luck of the Sea III, Mending, Lure III, and Unbreaking), which maximizes both fishing speed and treasure gained, while minimizing the experience used to restore the rod.

With these enchantments and while fishing outdoors, each minute you make an average of 8 catches, bearing experience orbs worth an average of 28 XP. Any Mending equipment worn may take 1 XP from each orb, perhaps reducing the total as low as 20 XP. The rod itself averages 1 damage per four catches on average, and if it has only one point of damage it repairs that for free! If multiple items are being mended, the rod may take a second point of damage before it mends, and then take an XP for its next mending. Mending affects any armor worn and the rod, but an additional item can be included by placing it in the off-hand. Total yield is thus 400 XP/game day (1200/real-time hour) if items are being mended, or 560/day (1680/hour).

Fishing under rain adds 25% to the yield (wait time is 20% less), for a potential of 25-35 XP / minute as long as the rain lasts.

Aside from the basic experience for catching items, there are a couple of "side hustles" that can yield extra experience:  Cod or Salmon can be smelted (22.4 XP/stack)   Any magic items (bows, rods, books) not kept for your own use can be fed to a grindstone for extra experience.  

This is also a good way to while away rainy days and storms, when exploring may be unpleasant or dangerous, but AFK fish farms can also be constructed for reduced boredom.

## Trading
Trading gives a fair bit experience itself, but emeralds can also buy Bottles o' Enchanting.  While fairly expensive for the experience stored, these are truly portable, and can be used to top up your experience to reach any desired level.  In the process, several useful villagers can be "leveled up" to provide more useful items.   

A variety of sellable items can be produced by automatic farms, easily farmed by hand, or provided as surplus from a mob grinder.  Note that if a villager has any options for their first tier of trades (Novice), you can effectively choose for them, if you have not actually traded with them yet:   The trick is to break their job block and let them revert to unemployment, then replace the block.  This does not work for higher-tier trades, but it does let you pick one book (often Mending) from a librarian, pick a farmer's first crop, and make sure that other professions do indeed offer their "cash machine" novice trades.

The following list focuses on "easy pickings".  

- Farmers each buy one of the base crops immediately, and as they level up they all offer to buy pumpkins and melons. The crops can be automatically or easily farmed, especially the pumpkins and melons.
- Wood can be converted to sticks and sold to fletchers. Later, fletchers buy string and feathers.
- Paper can be sold to all cartographers and some librarians.  If leather is plentiful, the librarians may also buy books. This also helps level the librarians to sell more enchanted books.
- Shepherds buy one color of wool up front, and later they buy some dyes.  Some luck is needed with the dye trades, to get dyes that you can farm easily (that is, no lapis lazuli or small flowers).  Bone meal is key here; it is easily produced with a composter (and/or skeleton bones), and besides crafting dyes directly, it can be used to rapidly grow the tall flowers.
	- Apprentice:  white (bone meal); black (squid ink);  gray (black+white); lime (green+white)
	- Journeyman:  red ( rose bushorbeetroot); yellow (sunflower); pink (peonyorred+white); light gray (black+white); orange (yellow+red)
	- Expert: green (cactus); brown (cocoa beans) magenta (lilac)
- The same cleric who sells you the bottles also buys rotten flesh from a mob farm, and later netherwart. If you have a gold farm, that can also be helpful.
- If you have an iron farm, you can sell to the various blacksmith types, rapidly leveling them up to selling you diamond gear.
- If you have a desert nearby, a cartographer buys 11 glass panes (base quantity) for 1 emerald.

Each trade (both selling stuff for emeralds, and buying the bottles) also grants an average of 4.5 XP to the player, 5 extra if the villager is willing to breed.  This means that rather more experience is gained in the trading than stored in the bottles!

The Bottles o' Enchanting themselves average a yield of 7 XP each, so a stack of them yields around 448 XP.  

Trading is a good source of experience for repairing items (i.e those equipment enchanted with mending) but not as a permanent source of XP.
