## Removed splashes
Main articles: Java Edition removed features § Splashes and Bedrock Edition removed features § Splashes
When a splash is removed, the line it occupied in splashes.txt / splashes.json is deleted, meaning the line number of all subsequent splashes lowers by one.

## Notes
1. ↑This is the line number of the splash in the "splashes.txt" file; splashes are not actually numbered in any way in splashes.txt itself.
2. ↑ a b cThe exact version a splash was added is not always known. In such cases, the earliest version the splash is known to have appeared in is listed.
3. ↑This splash is intentionally a duplicate, and is part of the joke; see MC-75202.
4. ↑ a b c d e f g h i j k l m nIncluded in the replacement splashes added in 19w34a; added to splashes.txt in 1.16-rc1.
5. ↑ a b c d e f g hIncluded in the treatment pack splashes added in 1.16.0; added to splashes.txt in beta 1.16.100.58.
