# Tutorials/Construction
For new players on Minecraft, fending off monsters and harvesting materials can already be a very painful and confusing job. This tutorial will help you construct some of the most useful as well as some of the most impressive buildings available to Minecraft.

## Basic house
A basic house is anything from a 5×5 square to a castle the size of a Minecraft world. They can be made of any material, in any biome, anywhere. The most common type of starter house is a hole dug into a hill or mountain (similar to the Cave House). 

### The Cube
You can make a cube house which is a shelter when you come back from mining or fighting, for example.

### The Fortress
This is the best choice if you wish to create a permanent base. This consists of a large fortified wall with an overhang to keep spiders out, as well as a wet or dry moat (optional). This will surround your entire settlement. This means your farms, houses and any other buildings you have will be protected. You may also wish to build a secondary fortification inside as well as a real-world castle (see topic below), just in case of a breach. In addition, you will want to build guard towers in each corner of the compound. This is to help keep your walls clean of mobs. These towers, if possible, should protrude from the corners so that you can clearly see and shoot anything near your wall. Be able to do this for the entire length of the wall to the next corner, or minimally to the halfway point between the two towers. This type of building is recommended for a player with large amounts of resources at their disposal.

### The Castle
Essentially the cube, except it has battlements containing (imaginary) snipers and cannons. One of the major differences between the castle and the cube is that the castle is supposed to actually look good. To make it look good you can extend out your cube and add blocks or slabs on every second block.

The cobblestone can be replaced with any block.

Build this on all 4 sides of your castle using cobblestone, wood, or both!

### Above-ground Bunker
A half-buried structure, it has the conveniences of underground shelters with the provision for windows which double as above-ground firing ports. You enter from the top, which has a trapdoor.

Also, iron doors or trapdoors are a good choice when keeping the hordes
out, or even better an underground system of tunnels connecting to multiple pillboxes or a base.

### Free-standing Structure
A basic house that is built on flat land and is completely open. These houses are easy to spot and maybe multiple floors. On average, these houses use anywhere between 2 and 10 stacks of materials.

### Cave House
Instead of having to build a house, use what Minecraft provides you, and build your house in a cave or other naturally-generated structure. They use minimal resources but may cost a significant number of pickaxes. They are hard to see, and a landmark is recommended. It is also helpful to acquire useful items like stone, iron, coal, and, if you’re lucky, diamonds, while you're digging out an area for your house.

### Lean-to
A house that is a part-free-standing house, and part-cave. An ideal combination of both worlds. The pickaxes are used here to gather materials for the main house while making more room underground.

### Space Needle
These houses are basically a large point leading up to a crazy height. They offer excellent views, and are quite creeper-resistant, especially if the bottom few layers are made of obsidian. However, they are very hard to expand, cost extremely high amounts of materials, and are rather monotonous to ascend. Building an elevator, preferably a two-way design, would solve the third problem.

### Bunkmates
If you find an NPC Village, you can make your home in a villager's house! These are ready-generated houses handy for you to use, and expansion can be done with the help of a few spare materials.

Please note that if you are not on peaceful mode, you may cause a zombie siege.‌[Java Edition  only]

### Simple-framed Building
A simple and good-looking house can be made by making 4-to-5-block-high pillars arranged in a square or rectangle. These pillars can be made of cobblestone. Join them at the top with cobblestone beams. Then fill in the gaps with wooden planks. You can also add windows. To make a roof cover the top and place wooden stairs on it, arranged in a pitched fashion. Logs and white stained clay (or wool) can be used instead to make a Tudor house.

### Underground Shelter
This is a type of building under the ground, like a bombing shelter or nuke shelter. This is for a more hidden type of shelter under the ground/ocean and makes a nonpublic safe house. They may be hard to find, so create a landmark to let you know it's there. It is safer than a shelter above ground. Advantages are no one/thing can find you, and you are more protected. You can also use it as a point where you can have a mine. Disadvantages are you can't have windows, so you have to actually exit your shelter to see outside (or make a hole in the ground to see outside) and the fact that every expansion requires a pickaxe. Also, if you break a hole and there's lava or water, you are stuck and you are very likely to die.
