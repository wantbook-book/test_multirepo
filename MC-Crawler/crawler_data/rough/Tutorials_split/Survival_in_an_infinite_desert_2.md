Detailed construction plans for a 5×5 "Day 1" desert house are here: Tutorials/Desert shelter

#### Defenses
On your first or second day build a defensive system around your house. Dig two-block-deep trenches (or two-block high sand walls) in a square or ring around your house, at least 3 blocks away from your house walls. So for a 5×5 walled house, dig an 11×11 or 13×13 square ditch. 

If you dig rather than build, you can collect most of the sand you need for a sandstone-roofed house. On the other hand, the fastest way to create a defensive barrier is to dig a one block deep trench in the sand, and use the sand collected to build a one block high wall on the inside edge (house side) of the trench, creating a 2 block high vertical obstacle that only spiders and flying or teleporting mobs can cross.

The 3 block margin around the edge is to stop creepers blowing up your house if they explode at your perimeter line. Put a bridge across this trench (or a "doorway" in the wall) only one block wide and block it at night, or whenever you are away from your house, with at least one cactus on the inward side. Make sure there are no loose blocks down in your trenches (or up against your walls); ensure that the barrier is fully two deep / two high everywhere (except at your cactus-protected bridge or doorway). Otherwise, mobs can cross any gap in the ditch or wall where it is only one block deep or one block high. Mobs may fall into the ditch, in which case you can easily (though slowly) kill them with your fist.

Bear in mind this ditch system does not (yet) stop spiders, so don't wander out at night and be careful coming out in the morning (particularly for creepers). Adding some cacti in the zone between the ditch and the house can stop spiders or at least harm them and alert you if they are there. If you have time, put a few cacti on your roof for the same reason. 

If you place a cactus on top of a single block of sand, it's safe for you: you can walk or run into this 'potted' cactus without being hurt because the sand block is slightly wider than the cactus. The only way to hurt yourself is by jumping or falling onto it. This also means this type of cactus hurts only spiders (when they climb up on it), not other mobs. For any cactus you are likely to have to move around near to, the 'potted' cactus-on-sand method is best. For outer defenses that you don't normally go near, you can put the cactus straight on the ground so it is more likely to do damage. 

On the next day (or sooner if you can work fast), add a second, outer trench ring, so that if the first trench ring is destroyed by a creeper you are not holed up inside your house and vulnerable to a second creeper destroying the house. Losing your house walls may mean a quick death because you cannot defend against the zombies and husks.

Also, add a wall of cacti (either later as an addition, or as an alternative to the ditch system). You can't place cacti next to each other and you can only place them on sand, but if you make a ring of zigzag (diagonally adjacent) cacti around your house, this forms a solid wall. As a bonus, mobs can be tempted into running into the cacti, taking damage, though this is a slow way to kill them. It helps if you are also hitting them at the same time. With the zigzag arrangement, if you get diagonally on from a mob, it can attempt to path through the (too small) gap between the cactus, and repeatedly hit the thorns until it dies. The cactus destroys any loot drop though so it's better to finish mobs off with your fist if possible. Also if the mob suicides against a cactus you don't get experience. The cactus wall also does not stop spiders, though it damages them slightly as they cross over it.

As the cacti grow higher, they do more damage to spiders that climb over them, making the spiders easier to kill by the time they reach you, and alerting you of their approach by making hurt sounds.

#### Strengthening your shelter
Sand is a weak material and subject to gravity which means it fares pretty badly if a creeper manages to somehow get through. Reinforcing the core of your main house should be a priority, after immediate survival, if you need to remain in the area. You need to continue to improve your spawn base, more so than in a normal game, because resetting your spawn point is likely to be difficult and take some time. Until such time as you have the ability to reset your spawn point to a 'safer' place than your spawn-area house, you should keep strengthening that house.

If dirt is readily available then it's possibly not worth the effort of crafting sandstone when you first build your house because this process takes at least 4 times longer (plus crafting time) and sandstone's blast resistance is only slightly higher than sand. However, later on, start replacing the innermost walls (and floor and ceiling) of your house with sandstone, or at least, the walls and ceiling of an inner 'sanctuary' room.

Also, because you don't have normal tools, if you place sandstone incorrectly or change your mind, it's time-consuming to remove, making any placement errors or redesign a real hassle and any part of your house that is not made of sand, you can't place a cactus on, which can weaken your defensive options (you could, however, have a lower level of sandstone with sand on the top surface to allow you to place cactus).

If remaining in the deep desert long-term, if you have a crafting table and a bucket for water available, building your house from concrete could be a far superior option to sandstone.
