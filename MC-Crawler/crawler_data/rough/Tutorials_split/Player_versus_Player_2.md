| Fire AspectandFlame   | Deals fire damage, higher levels makes it last longer.                                                                                                                | Used on: Sword (Fire Aspect), Bow (Flame)                                   | Fire damage isn't affected by armor, but Fire Protection will lessen the damage. So, these enchantments are not always reliable: don't solely depend on them working with someone who hasFire Resistancepotions or fully enchanted armor as they may be immune. Fire may also be used to expose opponents in dark areas, as well as obstructing their view. However, if you combine Fire Aspect with Sharpness, your opponent would quickly be stuck in a catch-22 situation; If they have fire protection, Sharpness V + Strength II potions would make quick work of them in a few hits. If they don't have fire protection, they'll take significant burn damage every time you hit them, and force them to carry fire resistance potions which takes up valuable inventory space. One of the major drawbacks of fire aspect is that sometimes the fire tick gets in the way of their knockback (Players are immune to knockback for up to 0.5 seconds after taking damage in Java Edition, and on Bedrock Edition, they're immune to both knockback and further damage in that frame.) which makes them more difficult to get off you in a pinch, and could result in you taking more damage than the enemy if you aren't careful with distancing. |
| SharpnessandPower     | Deals a flat amount of extra damage (Sharpness) or an additional percentage of damage (Power). Higher levels increase said bonus damage.                              | Sword (Sharpness), Bow (Power)                                              | Sharpness increases damage dealt by 1.25 per level of enchantment (pre-1.9 Java and in Bedrock Edition)As of the 1.9 Combat Update (Java Edition), this value has changed to an additional 1 damage for Sharpness I and another 0.5 for each level of Sharpness after that, up to a maximum of +3 damage for Sharpness V.Power increases your bow damage by 50% for Power I and an additional 25% for each level after that, up to a maximum of +150% for Power V. Please note that the bow, at full charge, may randomly cause extra damage.A common misconception is that enchantments cause a random amount of extra damage. This is NOT TRUE. Enchantments increase your damage by a flat amount for the sword, and a percentage for the bow. The problem is that the bow itself does damage randomly at full charge, and the difference of damage is a lot clearer with the 150% bonus at Power V than with an unenchanted bow, and ends up creating the confusion that the enchantments are to blame for this random damage, while the reality is that the Power enchantment scales off the bow's inherently random damage, but it's not random in itself.                                                                                       |
| Thorns                | Wearer has a chance to reflect taken damage back at the opponent at the cost of durability. Higher levels offer a greater chance to reflect damage.                   | For anyarmor.                                                               | (pre-1.16.2) Be wary of the extra durability damage your armor takes, as armor used to take double the durability damage If you use Thorns, so your armor will quickly break unless you also useUnbreaking. After 1.16.2, Thorns only does durability damage to armor if the effect activates, making it a lot more durable than previous versions. Even with Unbreaking 3, be very careful about using this enchantment as taking excess damage to your armor is dangerous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| KnockbackandPunch     | Knocks target back farther. Higher levels will increase distance.                                                                                                     | Sword (Knockback), Bow (Punch)                                              | Both of these enchantments aren't well liked by the community. However, in some cases, both of them can be lifesavers. Punch can knock back enemies especially in sticky situations, so even if you launched a weak bow shot, it can push your assailants far enough for you to recover. Meanwhile, Knockback I is useful in Netherite PVP especially when attempting to combo. Since netherite armor has a natural knockback resistance, it's hard to knock away your opponents in this kit, but with Knockback I, the KB resistance is nullified by the enchantment, allowing players to finally combo people to death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Protection            | Absorbs a certain percentage of all damage depending on the level.                                                                                                    | For anyarmor.                                                               | This is one of the best enchantments for armor as a full set of Protection IV can reduce damage additionally for another 64% on Java, and 80% on Bedrock. (seearmor) A full set of Protection IV is the best choice for "Protection-related" enchantments on Bedrock, and will be the best in most situations on Java, sans the explosive-based endgame combat on hardmode servers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Blast Protection      | Absorbs a certain percentage ofexplosiondamage depending on the level.                                                                                                | For anyarmor.                                                               | One piece of Blast Protection IV armor and 3 pieces of Protection IV will protect against the deadliest threats on higher difficulties, such as Creepers, TNT minecarts, or End crystals. It is most useful on hard difficulty where explosion damage is a serious threat and smart players may try to look for positions to blow you up instead of stabbing you to death. (Dear Notch, that was awful phrasing. Forgive me.) It also protects against fireworks, so if someone is spamming 7 layered fireworks at you with a Multishot Quick Charge III Crossbow, you'd be in a much better state with a piece of Blast Protection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Fire Protection       | Absorbs a certain percentage offiredamage depending on the level, and reduces the duration that you'll be on fire for after being ignited.                            | For anyarmor.                                                               | Having one armor piece with Fire Protection is a good idea in some situations such as in the Nether where items like flint and steel and lava buckets are common weapons. However, putting fire protection prevents you from putting other forms of protection on your armor, which may become a problem in most forms of PVP, when you would have fire resistance potions rendering fire protection armor obselete, and you'd be taking significant extra damage since fire protection doesn't protect against much more dangerous threats like harming arrows, strength II axe crits, or end crystals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Projectile Protection | Absorbs a certain percentage of projectile damage depending on the level.                                                                                             | For anyarmor.                                                               | This is effective against opponents who choose to snipe and bow spam you, but like Fire Protection significantly harms your melee prowess. It can also be helpful againstdispensersas they can firearrowsquickly. Note that this only protects from theimpactof the projectile, not any effects that come with it, e.g. fire from afire chargeor potion effects from a tipped arrow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Feather Falling       | Absorbs a certain percentage offall damage, including damage fromender pearlsand crash damage while gliding with the Elytra.                                          | Boots only.                                                                 | If you frequently use ender pearls to engage or escape or have the tendency to do oopsies with the elytra, this enchant will prove invaluable to you. It's always a good safety net to have, in fact, as you never know when you'll make a mistake and fall a large distance. It can also coexist with protection on boots, so you don't need to make the horrible decision of "this or that?" Note that even though the damage is negated and the enchant is called feather falling, the fall damage sound remains, potentially alerting your enemies to your presence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

This should be the enchantment of choice when fighting underwater.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

This enchantment allows you to engage and escape much faster in a naval battle, and will give you an easy advantage if you combine its mobility bonus with placement of water buckets, as you'll wade through the water faster than your enemy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Infinity              | Fire unlimited regular arrows, but at least one must be in your inventory.                                                                                            | Forbow.                                                                     | Infinity is a good enchantment for spamming lots ofarrows. This is well paired withUnbreaking, as the number of arrows that can be fired in total is increased. Keep in mind that it doesn't allow you to fire infinite tipped arrows, so if you're using tipped arrows to fight, it's much better to have a bow with mending which can be reused, or a Crossbow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Be careful when using riptide without an elytra, however, as you might fall to your death if you go too high up and fail to break your fall. Also in Bedrock Edition, Riptide deals splash damage, extremely useful in teamfights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Each level of Impaling deals 2.5 extra damage, which stacks up really fast when used with a Riptide-enchanted trident.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
