# Tutorials/Multiplayer PvP bases
A server with a factions plugin installed is quite different to play than almost any other server. In factions servers, players team up to dominate the map. This can lead to some epic fights, as well as much fun. However, players that are new or are simply uninformed can be quite befuddled by the different play-style as it adds several new mechanics. Often, people with end-game gear dominate the spawn point, all blocks within a 10,000 block radius of spawn are inhabited, and most of the resources within a 20,000-block radius are stripped bare. With the right knowledge, and a little bit of luck, though, it is possible to lead your faction to rule the map.

A significant portion of this guide also applies to anarchy servers, although in that case  be aware that they will have far more hostile environments and players on top of the widespread use of hacked clients, non-existent claiming system (if someone wants your land, they'll just take it from you or grief it into oblivion), and near-total lack of rules.

## 
Multiplayer servers often have custom commands or items in order to facilitate the functions that they offer, so it's important to research the commands that the server or its plugin use. This can be done online by looking up the command list, or you can use /help to check the commands in-game. The following paragraphs are using popular examples of commands that accomplish common functions, so they should be accurate for the most part, but they may not match up 100%. 

Be sure to inform yourself of any plugins or mods in use by the server. These can change up the gameplay drastically, so they're worth you familiarising yourself with them and reading up on them before joining.

### Starting out
Time: 60–120 seconds

Head to the server spawn using /spawn, then type in /wilderness (or /wild , or /rtp) to get yourself teleported to a random spot in the wilderness. Input the /f map command to check if there are any other factions nearby. If so, move away as far as you can, at least until they disappear from the faction map. Secondly, use /f list to look at the top three factions and take note of their membership and numbers. The numbers represent land claimed, current power, and max power. If the current power is 0 or negative, then you can claim their land. If the land claimed is 0, then they have no territory (though they still probably have some gear). This is not necessary for where or how far you want to go, but such information is always handy. Most servers also give players a set of stone tools (although some give far more than that) to start with. If you do not have anything, then type /kit or /kits. If that doesn't have any effect, then /kit starter or /kit basic might work.  Remember to use /help to easily find out the commands the server uses.

Also, check in on what plugins are in use on the server by doing /pl. If you do not have permission, ask a high ranking staff member or the owner. Different mechanics, such as a guns plugin or a steel mod, can greatly change the worth of resources, and you should double-check it before making a plan of what to do or where to settle.

Find out about the largest factions (normally the top 4 or 5 on the faction list) and who is fighting who. Typically there will be a large conflict between the two largest factions, or a smaller faction that is fighting an alliance of other factions. This information will prove useful later when you need to make allies, enemies, raid, and conquer.

### On the road again...
Time: 30–60 minutes

Once you have information on the factions, as well as your set of starting tools, head out and find a good location for your base. As long as you have a stable amount of food, sprinting won't be much of a problem. As you hike, make sure to do all of the following:

- Make sure to avoid allplayers
- Kill animals in order to gain resources. You might be able to leave some in order to use them for farming later on, but keep in mind that any resources left out in the open is up for grabs, and you aren't likely to have time to lead them over at this point in the game.
- Harvest wildsugar caneandpumpkinsfor resources or to sell to other players.
- If a generated structure is found, especially near the spawn point, ignore it. There is a good chance that everything is looted, thevillagersare killed, or the structure is griefed. However, if the structure has not been looted yet, it is a good idea to harvest the crops from any village farms and gather the items in any chests first.Desert pyramids provide 9 blocks ofTNT; by mining the pressure plate in the center of the hidden room, it is possible to obtain them without triggering the trap.
- If you travel through a jungle, make sure to collect up to a stack ofcocoa beans, as well as some jungle wood logs to farm cocoa beans from. These may prove useful forbrown dyeor selling to other players.
- Once night comes, then you may or may not keep traveling. Some servers have moremobsthan singleplayer to make up for the number of players killing them. If you think you can handle the mobs then keep moving, but if not, then you can dig a 3 block deep hole for yourself in the ground, jump in, and put a block over your head. You can then wait all night, or disconnect from the server and do something else for a few minutes. Another recommended strategy is to use the/sethomecommand, then go find something to do at the server spawn as the night passes. At dawn, simply type /home to return to your previous location and continue your journey.
- Dont forget to use/delhome [<home's name>]to delete the home, as in some servers you have a maximum of homes
- Make sure to collect as manywheat seedsas you think is necessary and a fewsaplingsof any type (make sure to collect at least four if they are dark oak saplings). This will ensure that you will have a source of wood no matter where you decide to set up base.
- If you reach anocean, it is a good idea to build aboatat this point, becauseswimmingis even slower than walking if server is on a version below 1.13 (many PvP servers are pre-1.9). With a boat, however, travel time can be cut in half.Oceantravel is generally superior to land travel. If you come across an ocean, you should consider sailing across because you will travel farther and faster, you will not wear down your hunger bar (very important for players with little food), and you don't have to deal withmobs(exceptdrowned, post 1.13) orplayers.
- If you keep walking, eventually you will have to deal with a world border. On most servers, there is a point around 5000 or 10000 blocks on server, which nothing can go past. This is to encourage raiding, so people don't keep walking for millions of blocks and never get raided. It is important to not make a base right on the edge of the world border. Many people find faction bases by walking around the very edge of the map, so it would be smart to stray away from the very edge.
- Be careful—if players offer you items or currency without asking for anything for them in return, they most likely have more sinister motives for doing so.
