### Zoo
Ever wanted an area to see all the mobs in their epic glory? Build this! It's best if you use bricks, stone bricks, or stone. You'll also need fences or glass, and signs. First, build various pens for mobs. Place glass on all sides, or just one. Alternatively, you could make a deep pit and put mobs in it. Put a fence around the outside.
When you're done with pens, place paths guiding players around. If you want it to look nice, place large fountains, flowers and hidden note blocks around. If you want it realistic, build restaurants, statues, and gift shops around. If you have hostile mobs in your zoo, you can use a name tag to rename them so that they do not despawn

### Natural vacation beach
This is simple. Find a lake or beach, dig out a large area, fill it with sand, and your own touches, and tada! You're done. Here is one way to make beach chairs:[1]

Note: The terracotta can be replaced with wool.

### Man-made vacation beach
This is a little harder than the natural version. Dig out a large area. Make it at least 60Ã—60 blocks big, slowly getting deeper. Fill the outer shore with sand, add your touches and tada! You're done! you can also blow up a large area to do it faster and make it look more natural.

### Sand castle
Build a big castle of sand and sandstone with many rooms, chambers and whatever else you may desire. Add a moat, sniping towers, or other defenses to make it a nice sand strong hold.

### Camouflage
This really serves no purpose in singleplayer. Simply place tall grass, vines, leaves, trees, and water on and around your base(s). It can give it a kind of cool look, depending on how well you do.

### 
If you have a tall base and you want to get down faster, place water on the ground to land on from a fall, so you can jump down safely. Or, if you have version 1.8, you can use a trampoline made of Slime Blocks to bounce between floors of your base.

### Add underground floors to your shelter
Using this gives you a chance to find resources, and in the case of invasion by mobs, it always provides a safer spot. Underground floors are also useful for making mob grinders or animal farms. If you're really good, add a whole back up shelter under ground. If you like to be safe, add multiple bunkers, but hide a super safe and secret bunker. You could also make a part of the floor out of glass in the same spot on each floor, so you can see all the way down, and it looks nice if you do it right.

### Add above-ground floors to your shelter
It is normally advised that you do this after building underground floors, especially if you have a ton of resources (after mining the basement out). These floors could even give you a chance to "snipe" some creepers and spiders in the morning.

### Balcony
Place your balcony so that it has a nice view! Add a chest with bows and arrows for quick mob sniping. Useful for a variety of things, from providing a point for easy kills to enjoying views.

### Landing and takeoff platforms
If playing with flying enabled (for example, in Creative Mode) you can create platforms at the same height on multiple buildings for easy flight between the upper levels of different locations. This works great in tree-forts, cities, and anywhere that multiple balconies are otherwise unconnected. Since 1.11.2, firework rockets have allowed the player to have a propelled flight with elytra, so these platforms should have water to slow the impact due to how fast players can fly, if these are meant for elytra.

### Remake it out of a different material
Install luxurious violet carpeting for the bedroom. Give your craft room a nice glass roof. Rebuild the armory out of obsidian. Redo your outer walls in smooth stone. Add a second story to your library.

### Make another base in a new location
Having more than one base helps if you need to travel farther to get resources. A base next to your spawn point is helpful if you built your main base far away and you died at night. A base in a desert can provide sand, and a base in a tundra can provide snow. A base hovering in the sky can provide entertainment, especially if mobs spawn on the edge of it. A great idea is to connect them with nether portals that have a secure hallway in the nether.

### An emergency kit
In case you need to quickly gear up and run back to get dropped gear or items. Perhaps a sword, cake or a stack of porkchops, and stack of torches. A more advanced kit can be made from dispensers that give you items at the click of a button or a step on a pressure plate, although arrows and torches still have to be accessed from a chest or two (if you want the whole stack) unless the dropper is used.

### Add an escape tunnel
You never know, a creeper might one day get you. Build a tunnel to escape it. It could also be used to lead to a secondary base. Another idea is to have the tunnel lead to a central room with several other tunnels branching off of it, with tunnels leading to the surface, caves, perhaps even a secret hideout. If playing on a multiplayer server, maybe even add a few dead-end tunnels to confuse anyone who may be following you through the tunnels. 

### Lava lamp
Simply make a hollow space out of glass and fill it with lava. An efficient method is to run a vertical column through many floors powered by a single lava block at the top. You can also make one of these high above your base to mark it from afar. If your house is made out of flammable blocks, this isn't recommended.
