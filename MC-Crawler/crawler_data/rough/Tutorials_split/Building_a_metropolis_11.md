## Currency

  


Note: The use of currency is mainly for multiplayer: to trade currencies to get items. However, it's possible to trade with villagers, of which emeralds are the currency.


Try having a currency so people can buy and sell things in your city. Good currency is usually something with practical value that follows a non-finite standard to prevent inflation. If you want a finite standard, you should be careful in order to avoid inflation. Therefore, great currencies to use are emeralds and emerald blocks (which are worth 9 emeralds each). This has the added benefit of allowing you to make villager shops with no difficulty. Another good currency would be 
Brick = $1, Iron = $10, Gold = $25, Copper = $40, Diamond = $50, Netherite = $75, and Emerald = $100. Here's a list of common currencies with notes about their usage: 

- Cobblestone:As one of the most common items, this is a good material for small transactions such as building supplies (ex. 5 Cobblestone = 1 Glass Block) and farm materials
- Wood planks/logs:This is a good all-around easy to use currency, and it has a definite and well-defined value in crafting and building. It is hard to make automatic Wood farms, so "money farming" is more difficult
- Wheat/bread:Wheat and Bread (also Carrots, Potatoes, and Beetroot) serve as an excellent currency. Though they can be farmed, a slight issue, these are useful and villager-trading accepted items great for small currency. The farming aspect of these items is not enough of an issue that these should not be used, however
- Bricks:The only practical advantage to using Bricks as money is that they look like Iron and Gold Ingots, making them recognizable as currency immediately. They are not able to be farmed, a good thing for a currency, but are nearly useless except to builders of brick buildings. The same also goes for Nether Bricks
- Literature:Paper, Books, and Bookshelves, though farmable and mostly useless, could serve as a currency. Remember that you can also write in books, that can be extremely useful. Knowledge is power, right? Also, if you use a books signed by you as a currency, your citizens could never farm or obtain illegally the currency, and it would be useful.
- Coal:This is a helpful and obtainable resource, making it a perfect currency. It is difficult to farm as well
- Redstone:First, beware of using redstone as currency, as it tends to be easy to find. It is cheap, so it could be used a small currency (Like a half-dollar)
- Nether quartz:Though occasionally useful in building or redstone, nether quartz is not as great of a currency as Diamond or Wood. However, being non-farmable and mildly useful, it is an adequate currency
- Iron:This is a handy material for currency since it has 3 "levels", those being Nugget, Ingot, and Block. For example, 1 Iron Nugget may be worth 2 Cobblestone, and an Iron Block may be worth a Diamond. Be careful though, since iron is easily farmed. However, the effort an Iron Farm takes may make it worthwhile as a currency
- Gold:Similar to Iron, but rarer. Since Gold farms are harder to make, Gold is harder to abuse as a currency.
- Diamond:Diamonds are arguably the 2nd best multiplayer currency, as they are rare, their value is well-defined, and they are not farmable.
- Emerald:An all-around helpful currency as Emerald is compatible with villagers, but beware of making Emeralds worth too much as they can be bought quite cheaply by anyone with a Paper or Wheat farm
- Nether stars/beacons:A hard to collect item, the nether star would make an excellent currency. It could be worth, say, 20 Diamonds. It is not farmable and useful, making it as perfect of a currency as Diamond or Wood.
- Leaves:As leaves are uncraftable and have 8 different types, leaves may be a good currency for your city. And because of that, you could make a system with different types of leaves having different values, like this: 5 Oak Leaves = 1 Birch Leaf, 2 Birch Leaves = 1 Spruce Leaf, 5 Spruce Leaves = 1 Acacia Leaf, 2 Acacia Leaves = 1 Jungle Leaf, 5 Jungle Leaves = 1 Dark Oak Leaf, 2 Dark Oak Leaves = 1 Crimson Leaf, 5 Crimson Leaves = 1 Warped Leaf, 10 Warped Leaves = 1 Cherry Leaf. As you may see, we have made a system for your currency. Also, here Oak and Birch leaves value less because they are more common, and Nether leaves value more because you need to go the Nether to get them.
- Netherite:Netherite is the best multiplayer currency, it does not burn in lava, their value is well defined, they are rare, and they are not farmable.
- Copper:Copper is easy to use as a currency, it is easily recognized as a currency, but it is farmable, however, but this is not a reason to not use it.

- Money plugins:You could find a plugin that is for money, use that for currency. It could involve transactions, etc.
- Money commands:If you are good withredstone, you could set up a system withcommand blocksthat tracks a player's "money", without it being easily hackable with creative mode server builders.

Note that you do not necessarily need a currency as you can do trades and such, but it is a more fun alternative.

## General tips
### Roads
Roads are present in virtually every city, but making them look nice is actually more complicated than one might expect. 

To start, roads tend to be direct, fast, smoothly curved routes. Certainly, any road that isn't at least about 7 meters wide shouldn't have 90-degree bends that are intended to run without stopping.

Roads also tend not to be steep, in real life, anything over 1/2 block up or down for every 6 blocks horizontally would be considered moderately steep. Anything more than about 1/2 block up for every 3 blocks horizontally for long sections would be considered steep, and other than in mountainous terrain, be limited to residential streets.

In Minecraft, terrain tends to vary on a smaller scale than in real life, and be much steeper as well.

Usually, long, wide "highway" type roads are as straight as possible, as cheap as possible, and require the least amount of terraforming possible. If there is a 30-meter-wide circular crater, sweeping around it smoothly is usually better than bridging it.

If there is a tall mountain in the way, going straight up it is not likely to be cheap to make or easy to travel. Go slightly up and around, if there needs to be a route to the top, make it connect to the main road and spiral up the mountain.

There are also multiple scales and types of roads with different qualities.

City street:
A city street intersection, complete with traffic lights.
An example of a city.
Recommended material, gray/blackconcreteand yellowterracotta.
Should have clear lanes.
Should have a lot of intersections and traffic lights.
Should be 3-9 blocks wide.
Should have many branch-offs.
Should cut through any obstacle that can be removed in less than a minute.
Should not be too steep.
Should wind around any other obstinate that is too big to remove.
Dirt/sand/gravel path:
Recommended material:Dirt,sand,dirt pathorpodzol.
Should wind around any obstacle, even small trees, shouldn't bridge anything bigger than a small stream.
Should be 1 to 3 blocks wide.
Can be any reasonably walk-able steepness (up to 1/2 slope,)
Small rural gravel or partial-stone road road:
Recommended material: Stone, cobblestone, stone bricks
Should wind around any natural structure or well-established construction. Feel free to gouge out rock-formations, place support-beams, etc as needed for road to be placed on. These generally should not be connected to any large long bridges, only small stone orwoodones with no extra support needed.
Should be 2 to 3 blocks wide.
Should be 3 to 7 blocks wide.
Should generally be under 1/3 slope. But avoid sloping in general as long as it doesn't mean tunneling through mountain-ranges or bridging valleys.
Downtown street:
Recommended material: Stone, obsidian, or any other road-like material.
Keep it as straight as possible, even if terraforming is needed.
Keep it as flat as possible, even if terraforming is needed, it may be small, but remember, thousands of people, rickshaws, pigs, horses, cars, chariots, carriages, magic carpets, elephants or pod racers use it daily.
Should generally be the equivalent of 1-2 lanes with 2 sidewalks, this could be anywhere from 5-17 blocks wide if sidewalks are included.
Commuter street:
Recommended material: Stone, obsidian, or other road-like materials.
Should be direct, efficient, but cost-effective as well, tunnels and bridges are fine, but only if they are needed. Preferably at most 1/4th slope.  stores mightbe nearby.
Suburban street:
Recommended material:Stone,cobblestone, orstone bricks.
1-2 lanes equivalent, a small sidewalk or possibly not, purely houses nearby. Can be up to 1/3, or possibly even 1/2 slope. Should do as little earth-moving as possible and doesn't need to be efficient as a through street. Typically 3 to 11 blocks wide.
Intercity highway:
Recommended material: Stone, obsidian, or other road-like materials.
Curves around things, but avoids sharp curves at all costs. Generally stays flat and direct with no stopping areas. Only becomes steep to go through mountain passes. Does not dodge light construction, simply tramples straight through it. Bridges anything but moderate-sized oceans. Typically 15 to 23 blocks wide, but may be smaller in pre-industrial societies.
Freeway:
NLEX toll gate in Minecraft
Recommended material: Pretty much anything road-like you can get your hands on.
Afreewayis a road designed for high-speed vehicular traffic. No walking or parking is allowed in freeways, so allow only people riding mounts to use it. Entrances and exits should be provided only at intersections that connect to other roads. Opposing directions of travel should be separated by median strips or barriers. Goes nearly straight, never exceeds about 1/8th slope, obliterates or bores through anything necessary excluding centers of cities or enemy territory (then wars are fought over its construction). The road should be about thirty blocks wide and as flat as possible. Bridges and tunnels can be built whenever needed, and no bridge type or tunnel is too expensive or extravagant for something like this. You can also include road tolls the players have to pay in order to use the road.
