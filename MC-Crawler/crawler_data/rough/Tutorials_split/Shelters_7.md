## Defense

These additions make your base safer and provide a certain amount of entertainment.

### Self-destruct button
Pretty self-explanatory, a button that blows up your base and kills the mobs and/or griefers in your house. Remember not to be near during the blast (or you can hide in your bunker with the switch inside)! Also be sure to have a world backup!

### Arrow slits
These are small holes in a wall that you can shoot arrows through but are small enough so that skeletons and other players have a hard time shooting back at you. This can be accomplished by stacking up cobblestone walls (the holes can be shot through) or simply digging a one-block hole through the wall and putting a slab on the bottom. Also, placing the non-block part of stairs facing each other, and using the upside-down stair function, you can make arrow slits almost impossible to shoot through unless you are close, so it is advised you put them far above ground.

### Murder holes
First, dig a 2 block deep hole in the ground. Dig another hole 3 blocks deep, 1 block away from the first hole. Dig out the block that separates the bottom of the 2-deep hole with the middle of the 3-deep. If done correctly, this should allow all mobs (except for spiders) to fall into the 2 block hole. Then, you simply go into the 3 block hole and attack their feet. Murder Holes often function best alongside a perimeter wall of some sort, with the 2 deep outside and the 3 deep inside. An extra addition to this is to make a large amount of murder holes, and form a tunnel system of sorts, so you can watch multiple holes at once. This works best before version 1.2 because the mobs have new coding that makes it hard to get them to fall in holes. They simply navigate around holes deeper than 2 blocks. A solution to that is to put signs around the holes but is usually more effort than worth.

### Skylight
Although this may not sound like much of a defense, a small skylight above your entrance/exit allows you to easily see any mobs (especially spiders) waiting to pounce on you from above. Not recommended in multiplayer, as it acts as another way for griefers to find your base.

### Anti hostile mob passageway
You can use the fact that snowballs push hostile mobs, by building a 1-wide bridge over lava and putting snow golems on the side (see gallery). The player and passive mobs can pass through safely, while hostile mobs get pushed to the lava by the snow golems' snowballs.

### Overhang
Since spiders can climb walls, a base needs to have either a ceiling or an overhang along the outside walls to be safe. The walls must be at least four blocks high (since spiders can jump up to three blocks high). Of course, a closed roof with a lava pond on top is also nice.

### Perimeter
Adding torches around your base can reduce the amount of monsters that spawn nearby, so add some light to your lawn! You can also use fences, cacti, and burning netherrack to keep enemies out. Just remember that spiders can jump your fences.

### Floodgate
Using a fairly simple redstone circuit connected to a lever at one end, and one or more pistons at the other end, you'll be able to build some simple floodgates. If you extend the pistons first, and then place water, or even lava behind it, you can get rid of or even kill any mob passing by pulling the lever and letting the water or lava flow! For a quick morning mob clean-up and a strong sense of catharsis, you can place lava floodgates surrounding your entire shelter, facing out. One throw of the lever reduces the surrounding landscape to a barren wasteland! Not to be used in wooded areas.

### Moat
The simplest of these is a "dry moat" or trench, a couple layers deep so that skeletons and zombies can't get across. This can provide you with a reasonably safe area that is outside. This can be filled with water to push the enemies to a mob grinder, or simply filled with lava which has more dramatic and obvious effects. Please note: It might not be a good idea to use lava when having a shelter built out flammable blocks such as wood, wool or wooden planks. Tower shelters would do well to have a three-block deep water moat to break the player's fall so they can safely fall to the bottom.

### Lake
If a moat does not feel sufficient, build a lake around your base, preferably several levels below the entry level and with a bridge to allow easy access back and forth. Again, it can be water, or, if you want a dramatic flair, use lava. Remember to protect the bridge well, though, and be sure you are protected from within the island in case you miss a spawner. Making a drawbridge out of trapdoors is a fun alternative to the actual bridge.

### Archery tower
If you have a plentiful supply of arrows, building a small tower to pick off nearby monsters can be fun and provide useful resources such as gunpowder.

### Dispenser turret
Put a dispenser with some arrows at your desired location (preferably next to a door) and a stone button/lever/pressure plate attached to it. This is handy if mobs want to pay you a visit. Splash potions can also be used as ammo, but are harder to obtain. The benefits of using potions is that they can affect a wider area than arrows.

### Traps
If you're not satisfied with moats or a perimeter fence, consider adding a trap or two. If you're up to a challenge (and on a multiplayer server), you could even make an entire trap, designed to look like a base! Dark rooms with no way out for mob spawning, entire mazes made of glass, and traps using pistons and lava. The possibilities are endless.
