#### Preparation

Descend to the level you wish to start mining based on the ore you wish to find. This is the start point denoted by the grass block.

Dig a 1×2 tunnel of 4 blocks long from the start point, then put a mark there denoted by the gold block.

Don't make it 1×3. That will only reduce the efficiency.



Turn right, dig 4 blocks, then put another mark denoted by the redstone block.



Turn left, dig 4 blocks, then put a mark.



Turn right return to the previous mark, dig 4 blocks, then put a mark.

Dig 4 blocks put another mark.



Turn left, dig 4 blocks, then put a mark.

Turn back, return to the previous mark, dig 4 blocks, then put a mark.

Dig 4 blocks and put another mark.



Repeat the previous step.



Repeat the previous step but while the player are doing so, they will reach the mark they have put before. Now the player have completed the first lap.


#### After the first lap

Choose one of four corners and go there. Go to the "gold" mark they have previously put.

Turn right, dig 4 blocks, then put a mark.

Turn left, dig 4 blocks, then put another mark.

Turn back, return to the previous mark, then dig a tunnel until they reach the "gold" mark they have previously put.



Dig 4 blocks, then put a mark.

Turn left, dig 4 blocks, then put another mark.

Turn back, return to the previous mark, then dig a tunnel until they reach the "gold" mark they have previously put.



Repeat the previous step.



Repeat the previous step. Now they have completed their second lap. Repeat the entire steps until they are satisfied.


### Speed Mining
Speed mining is a mining technique in which a player randomly mines out a 50 block radius around them. Stone can be instantly broken by using an Efficiency V diamond or netherite pickaxe while under the effects of Haste II from a beacon, allowing the player to quickly clear out a large area. It is at first expensive, but pays off quickly. It is suggested that the player to do this at diamond level.

To save inventory space and avoid having to smelt cobblestone into stone, the player can use a Silk Touch pickaxe to mine and collect ores, then use a Fortune III pick to mine the ores.

### Simple Strip Mining
This technique is to take off the top 6 layers of a mountain completely. Continue until the mountain is entirely flat. TNT is useful for the first 5 layers, since the explosion will destroy grass and dirt for the most part.

Diagram:

Key: A = Air
     B = Block
     L = Ground Level

Step 1: 

         A A A A A A A A A A
         A A A A A A A A A A A A
       A A A A A A A A A A A A A A

       A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A
     B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B

First 5 layers are gone when the player started mining.

This time-consuming method is a useful tool for when they need minerals or a flat area.

### Quarry mining
Quarry mining is very similar to strip mining, sharing the prospect of taking all resources within an area. These mining methods are used very commonly in Minecraft. The difference between quarrying and strip mining is that the process of quarrying involves a large rectangular or square strip, continually mined downwards with a staircase running along the side. This method got its name by its similarity to real world quarry sites. Quarries are typically ceased when a large cave is discovered (This does not directly stop the excavation, it just makes it difficult to continue), the miner abandons the quarry for another project, or bedrock is reached. A way to deal with large caves is to block the cave with Creeper-resistant materials, like obsidian. One can place a (powered) rail in a spiral, to allow ease of access.

- A finished quarry with obsidian and lava at the bottom.
- A quarry in construction.
- A recently begun quarry. There is a convenient, easily accessible ledge with chests, furnaces and a crafting table.
- The inside of a quarry.
- An elaborate 64 by 64 blocks quarry in the making.
- A 16×16 quarry being looked at from the top.
- Looking up from the bottom of a quarry mine.
- An unfinished 20×20 quarry.
- A quarry to bedrock.

The construction of a quarry is as follows: 

1. Determine the size of the project. There is no standard, so simply choose how big players want it to be. However it is advised that they make the area large, to maximize resources within a single quarry. (A typical quarry can be 20×20 or 20×30, for example)
2. Once the player have found a large enough space, dig down one space at the corner of their site. Next, mine the block adjacent to it. Continue this around the perimeter of their site until they have a 1-block-deep trench around the perimeter of the site.
3. Now that the player have set their perimeter, mine all of the surface blocks within their site. When this is finished, they should have a large, square, 1-block-deep hole in the ground.
4. Next, head back to the first corner that the player have dug in, and dig down one more block. Repeat what the player have did in step 1, but now they will be one level lower. Upon completing this level, they can begin placing their staircase/ladder/vines as well.
5. Continue the process of mining a layer, and then another, until they hit the bedrock level. This may take a few days of vigorous playing to accomplish, but their earnings will make it well worth it. For reference, 20×20 quarries (down to bedrock) typically yield 3-10 stacks ofcoal, 1-7 stacks ofiron ore, up to half a stack ofgold ore, perhaps 50 redstone dust(lower down), and a few lapis lazuli and diamond, though these results vary with the width, depth and location of their quarry.
6. Various gamemodsmay also provide tools for quarrying or similar rapid-mining techniques.

Really reckless miners have been known to make huge quarries, some giant ones are 50×50, 64×64 and 80×80, yielding a staggering 2200 stacks of cobblestone/stone. To put that in perspective, that many cobblestone blocks in a tower would be a whopping 140,800 meters tall, or an unrealistic 170 times the height of the Burj Khalifa, which is the tallest building on earth.  These will take a couple weeks of 24/7 gameplay, given their size, but the stone payoff is gigantic.

Example:

Key: - = Air
     B = Stone block
     S = Staircase

Although the yielded amount of cobblestone, dirt, sand, coal, iron, and to some extent gold, will be enormous, and the possibility of lava is very high, this is not the best method for mining diamond and lapis lazuli, because they're found only at the bottom of the map. (Note: Diamonds and lapis lazuli can be mined using this method, but due to their rarity, the placement of the quarry along with its size will determine the amount.) This type of mining is suggested for getting large amounts of cobblestone, iron and coal. Besides the ability to gain large amounts of resources, this type of mining may expose many caves for further exploration and mining.

Quarries may also offer some non-resource related benefits, such as keeping the area clean and fresh (not ruining the nature), as well as serving as a handy trap.

Warning: Be extremely careful around this type of mine, as a fall will surely be fatal, unless there is 1 level of water at the bottom. In order to prevent mobs from spawning, the shaft should also be well-lit.

Once a quarry is finished, there will remain a large, deep hole. There are many ways to utilize a spent quarry, but some choices are as follows:

** Underground Base **
Due to the open nature of a quarry, many players choose to build an intricate base floating in the quarry, and then fill in the unused space with dirt, gravel, sand and stone. If done correctly, an underground base will be undetectable from the surface, especially when grass grows on the surface above it. For extra stealth, consider planting trees in the open area. A player might deter miners by placing a large lava lake over the base. This will also decrease hostile mob spawns around the base.

** Structure space **
When a quarry is complete, the area can be filled with a structure such as a skyscraper or a tall building. This may be preferable to building at sea level, as the lower starting height may allow for larger structures within standard height limits. 

** Underwater Base **
These are made by the same method as an underground base, except the open area is filled with water from artificial springs, lakes, rivers, etc. For additional effect, a lot of players build underwater bases from glass blocks, and build airlocks for extra stealth. Most quarries are square or rectangular, so it is hard to disguise an underwater base as a natural lake or pond, but with a little bit of work, they can be made to look like a natural body of water.

** Multi-level Grinder **
After a quarry is finished, the large area mined out can make a perfect space for creating a large multi-level grinder.
