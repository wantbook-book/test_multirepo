### Sugar
Sugar can be obtained either by crafting with sugar cane, by killing witches, or crafting with honey bottle. Although the second option is not available on Peaceful difficulty, the first and third are. Simply put 1 sugar cane in the crafting area in your inventory or on a crafting table, and you will get 1 sugar. Put 1 honey bottle in a crafting table, in order to receive 3 sugar and an empty glass bottle.

Sugar can use to craft cake and pumpkin pie. Both are sold by farmer villagers.

## Not Achievable in Peaceful
These materials, sadly, can only be obtained as hostile monster drops. However, sometimes some of their crafting recipes may be able to be obtained by other means.

### Blaze Rods
Blaze rods can only be obtained by killing blazes, which is impossible on Peaceful difficulty. Unfortunately, blaze rods are essential to going to the End, because there is only a 1 in a trillion chance that an end portal will generate with all eyes of ender in it, and eyes of ender require blaze powder. However, brewing stands, which usually need a blaze rod to craft, can be found in igloo basements and village temples, but no potions can be brewed because they require blaze powder as fuel. Even though the player may not be able to go to the End on Peaceful difficulty, there are plenty of other things available to do in the Minecraft world.

This is one side of an igloo basement. The brewing stand can be seen in plain view. A brewing stand is the only item crafted with blaze rods that can be achieved by other means than crafting.
### Froglights
Froglights drop when tiny magma cubes be eaten by frog. Unfortunately, magma cubes don't spawn on peaceful and they are the only way to obtain froglight.

### Ghast Tears
Ghast tears, which drop from ghasts, are used to make potions of Regeneration and end crystals. Although both of these are helpful in Minecraft, neither of them could be made even if ghast tears could be obtained in some other way. This is because potions of Regeneration require blaze powder to make, and end crystals require eyes of ender, both of which can't be obtained on Peaceful difficulty because of the lack of blazes.

### Prismarine Shards
Prismarine shards, unfortunately, can only be obtained by killing guardians or elder guardians. However, all of the crafting recipes with prismarine shards: prismarine, dark prismarine, prismarine bricks, and sea lanterns, make up entire ocean monuments, and prismarine and sea lantern also generate in underwater ruins. If you are planning on getting a sea lantern, make sure you mine it with a Silk Touch pickaxe, because otherwise, it will drop only prismarine crystals.

### Shulker Shells
Shulkers have a 50% chance of dropping a shulker shell upon death. Despite the fact that shulkers actually do spawn on Peaceful difficulty, unlike most other mobs, the End can only in ridiculously rare cases (one in every 128/1,000,000,000,000 worlds, which contains an already-lit end portal) be accessed in Peaceful; therefore, shulker shells cannot be obtained on Peaceful. Shulker shells can be used to make a shulker box, which, although it isn't necessary for anything in Minecraft, can be very helpful at times.

There is a very, very small chance that the End will be available on a Minecraft world from an already-finished end portal frame in a stronghold, making shulkers accessible (see #Ender Dragon)

### Tridents
Drowned can spawn holding trident which sometimes drops when they get killed, which can be used as both a melee and a ranged weapon.
Unfortunately, drowned don't spawn on Peaceful and they are the only way to obtain tridents.

### 
Breezes, when killed, drop wind charges, which can be used as a ranged weapon.
Unfortunately, breezes don't spawn on Peaceful and they are the only way to ontain wind charges.

### Wither Skeleton Skulls
Wither skeletons, when killed, rarely drop a wither skeleton skull, which can be used to make the wither boss. Unfortunately, wither skeletons don't spawn on Peaceful, and they are the only way to obtain wither skeleton skulls. The only use of wither skeleton skulls is to create the wither(the Wither cannot spawn in peaceful anyway so there would be no point), or as a helmet. The wither drops a nether star, which can be crafted into a beacon. This means that beacons are one of the items that cannot be obtained on Peaceful difficulty. However, conduits, a similar block, are obtainable and constructive on Peaceful. A conduit requires a heart of the sea from buried treasure and 8 nautilus shells from fishing or bought from wandering traders, as well as prismarine block variants or sea lanterns to active it.

## Spawnable on Peaceful
These mobs are the few neutral/hostile mobs that can spawn on Peaceful difficulty. However, none of them, with the exception of the piglins, they can accidentally attack players when a piglin is about to shoot at a hoglin and the player blocks its way.

### Bee
Bees are the only arthropod mobs that don't despawn in peaceful. Bees only drop experience when killed, so it's better to farm them to produce honeycombs or honey bottles. These items can be used as food (honey bottles also remove poison), to craft honeycomb blocks, sugar, honey blocks (a sticky block similar to slime block but different), or to craft beehives.

### Ender Dragon
The ender dragon is the boss mob of the End dimension. It will drop tons of experience and a dragon egg upon death. Dragon eggs cannot be used to craft anything, but they serve as a trophy, showing that the ender dragon has been defeated. The End cannot be reached in Peaceful difficulty since eyes of ender require blaze powder to craft, which is unobtainable. Eyes of ender were formerly obtainable via villager trading, but now it is impossible. However, if one is super lucky, (one in a trillion) they can find a stronghold with all end portal frames already filled; this way, they can access the End in Peaceful, one such seed is 153528141396417860.[more information needed]

When you enter the End, the ender dragon will spawn. It cannot do damage to you but it will still knock you back, so the only things that are dangerous are that the dragon may push you into the void, or inflict falling damage when you are destroying end crystals. Apart from that, the fight should be easy. You can also use the end gateway portal and you will be able to access the End as much as you want. However, end crystals cannot be obtained in Peaceful, because ghast tears are unobtainable, so you cannot respawn the dragon.
