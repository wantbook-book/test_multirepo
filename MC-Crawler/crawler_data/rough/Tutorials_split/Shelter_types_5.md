### Treehouse
Materials

- ~80wood planks


Description

Treehouses provide a high base. They are useful, especially against creepers, because most are too high for creeper explosions to reach. They are often used with a bow and arrows because they are excellent sniping spots. Another advantage of treehouses is that they are a great lookout point. They give you a good view of the map, helping you find the place for your next shelter. Also, if you are thinking of making a treehouse as your permanent home, you could expand it by linking it to other trees, giving the player an extremely large and good lookout view. 


Location

The best tree for this is the jungle tree. This method of shelter does not only help you stay away from mobs at night- It's a great look-out position, especially if the jungle borders a desert or a plains biome. You can even create bridge gaps from other trees to make a whole network of treehouses! An added bonus also comes with the location- an almost endless supply of wood!


Construction

The first thing you will build when constructing a treehouse is the staircase. Without a staircase, you cannot reach the treehouse. The amount of stairs you build will vary depending on the height of the tree you are building in. Make these stairs and place them. Remember to place wooden planks under the stairs to support them. (Not only does this make them easier to build, it also makes the staircase look better.)

- Vines act like ladders (without a hitbox).

Now, you should have a staircase that leads to the top of the tree. Climb this staircase and lay down a 4×5 base of wooden planks. One common practice is to remove a layer of leaves and then, build the base. This maintains the same level as you would have had without a base. 

Next, build a layer of outer walls. These should only cover the border. To be economical, you could skip the corners, as they are not necessary. Build two more layers on each of these. 

Now, you will construct a roof. You don't need to add another border level; this was compensated for in the last step. Instead, fill in the top border with wooden planks. This roof should block out most of the light; look in the "Extras" section for ways to counter this.


Alternate No-Stairs Method

A more effective and easy method to construct a pathway for access to the treehouse would be to use ladders placed on the trunk of the tree to reach the entrance of the treehouse instead of stairs to access the treehouse which makes it less likely for mobs to climb onto the treehouse and also the benefit of using this method is that it uses fewer materials. It is strongly recommended that you use a trapdoor at the top of the ladders to prevent mobs from gaining access to the treehouse via the ladders.

Alternate roofless method

This method is best in high trees. Simply the same as before, but only build walls one high and then, place fences on top. It is useful when fighting mobs like creepers.

If you connect with other trees in a jungle you can make a large circular disk platform around each, allowing large, roofless, and safe "rooms". This method is only safe when you have plenty of torches.

Extras

- Staircase to the top
- Window
- Treehouse link: Multiple treehouses linked together. Best if treehouse is built in a forest.

- A good place to build a treehouse.
- What your finished staircase should look like.
- A finished treehouse.
- The interior of a treehouse.

### ICE CASTLE
An ice castle is some icebergs contained by a wall of blue ice, and corridors in the iceberg lit by lanterns. You can have villages inside of it if you want. Bedrooms are useful to make it good for living in, and you can also make towers. If you want to make a successful ice castle you will need blue ice, lanterns, beds and doors. You can make a courtyard out of stone. If you are in Creative mode you can make impenetrable walls with bedrock.

### Igloo
An example of an igloo.
Materials

- A lot ofsnow. (If you have a pumpkin, you could make a snow farm!)
- Ashovel.
- Optionally, someIcefor the windows.


Description

Not the strongest tower, but can be done if you live in a snowy biome.

Location

Any snow biome

Construction

First, get some snow, you'll need a lot of it. Use a shovel to get snowballs by breaking the snow. After you have collected enough, place them in a 2×2 square in the crafting grid. Get the snow blocks and build your shelter with them.

During construction, it might start snowing. Note that snow can fall on snows, causing a snow layer to form on top.

These snow shelters often look great in snow biomes.

Igloos can also generate naturally. These naturally generating igloos make great shelters, as they always generate with a door and helpful furniture such as a bed, crafting table and furnace, and sometimes even a brewing stand and a chest containing useful items.

Extras

- Windows made ofice.Packed iceandblue ice, however are not translucent.
- A well of liquid water.
- A fireplace. (Snowblocksandpacked ice/blue icedo not melt, but ice and snow layers do)
- A wooden door. (Use birch to keep it looking like an igloo)
- A snow farm!
