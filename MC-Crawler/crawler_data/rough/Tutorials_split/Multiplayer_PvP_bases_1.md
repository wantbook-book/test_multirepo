### Choosing a Location
Time: 5 seconds to 1 hour

Once you have reached a safe distance, it might be worth it to keep traveling depending on where you are and what you want to do. 

- If you're in theocean, you should usually keep going until you find land. However, if you already have everything you need, it might be a good idea to make an underwater base in the middle of the ocean (discussed later).
- Strongholds can be used as good bases. They allow for potentially exclusive (if no one has found the otherstrongholds) and easy access tothe End; they contain plenty ofbooksforenchanting, and your base will be already built and most likely secluded without you even having to lift a finger. However, they are somewhat easy to find for any player witheyes of ender, and they can be difficult to navigate due to the mazelike layout, which might allow players to sneak up on you.
- If the biome you are in does not fit to your tastes, you can build a base inthe Nether. Make sure to build it a decent distance away from the entrance Nether portal to prevent it being easily found by others.

There are a few recommended setups you can go with listed below. Dinky wooden houses that you might build on singleplayer worlds or co-operative multiplayer servers won't cut it in the savage world of Factions PvP (player vs player), and many a newcomer has been destroyed because of their lack of knowledge on proper base building. You have to be stealthy and fortified. Read the list below and see which one appeals to you and your location the most:

1. A vast above-ground stronghold. These are best for well-established factions that have the power and resources to build large above-ground fortresses and claim the entire base and the land surrounding it. If these are your ambitions, it's recommended that you travel to aplainsorsnowplainsbiome. If this applies to you, then skip to part I of the bases guide.
2. A floating sky base. Most places are good for this, but this design will not function well in biomes such asjungles,mountains, or other places with high elevation, as other players will be able to see your base easier. If this applies to you, then skip to part II of the base guide.
3. An underground bunker. Just about anywhere will do, but don't go down viacavesas miners venturing down into the caves will come across your base all too easily. In addition, digging from the bottom of the ocean down will almost guarantee that your base will never be found. If this applies to you, then skip to part III of the guide.
4. An underwater base. Obviously, you'll need anocean. It takes a lot of hard work to get one started up, and you'll probably drown a few times, but once you get it going it will be hard to raid asTNTwon't work on the outside and anyone who tries to dig into it will probably drown. If this applies to you, skip to part IV of the base guide.
5. Anetherbase. Though generally inaccessible at the start of your journey, the nether is rarely checked when players are looking for factions, giving you immense stealth. The Nether also provides you with a steady supply oflava, which is going to come in handy forsmeltingand defending your base. If you do decide to take on this ambitious challenge, skip to part V of the base guide.

Total time spent in Part I: 31 minutes to 3 hours

## Part II: Bases
It is suggested that you make a base that blends with the environment to prevent it from being found easily. Underground bases accomplish this the most effectively, but certain kinds of blocks can be used to make your base a little bit less apparent, e.g. snowy blocks for snowy biomes; grass, dirt, and stone for most "green" biomes...

Spending time on making a piston door can help, as it makes the entrance to your base much less apparent, making it harder for people to just stride in, and can sometimes even make your base close to invisible.

## I. The Aboveground Castle
### Planning
Time: 0–5 minutes in Minecraft, 5–15 minutes offscreen

### Terraforming
Time: 3-5 hours

No matter what your plan is, you're going to need flat land, and lots of it. Stone shovels are the best tool for clearing out tons of dirt, since they're quick, cheap, and easily replaceable. Likewise, stone pickaxes are best for the odd clump of stone. First, dig out the perimeter of your base, then start digging in. Keep a lookout for hostile mobs or even other players that have tailed you. Extreme distance is a good defense, but it's not infallible. Also, make sure to plant those saplings, and use some bonemeal to grow them quicker if you have any bones. By the time this is done, you should have a ton of dirt leftover. If the server also has a shop plugin, great: all that dirt you dug up is probably worth a couple of diamonds. If not, then keep it on hand just in case. You never know when a cheap, unburnable, gravity-defying filler material will be useful. In addition, a lot of dirt gives you a potential advantage with the ability to create massive farms.

### Physical Defenses
Time: 1 hour

You've got your area—now it's time to secure it. There's three types of defenses: Active, Passive, and Hybrid. Active defenses actively try to kill any threats posed. This could be people in your faction defending against the attacking enemy, landmines, fall traps, arrow dispensers, etc. They are usually activated when a threat is within range and lay dormant when they are not. Passive defenses attempt to stop potential threats before they become threats. These usually are obstacles rather than deadly things. This might include iron doors, cobwebs, walls, stacks of gravel, and the location of your base if it is somewhere hard to get to. Sometimes active and passive defenses come together to form Hybrid defenses, which are, as you might have guessed, a combination of active and passive defense. This could be lava inside a wall to flow out when someone tries to dig through, checkerboarded holes with landmines inside, and many other creative combinations. When designing your defenses, strive to have mostly hybrid defenses, and have a good balance of active and passive defenses. A base with fully passive defenses will eventually be gotten through, and if your base has only active defenses it will be so easy to get into that the attrition of enemies will eventually exhaust your active defenses. This isn't to say that all your defenses should be hybrid, but most of them should be.

In addition, there are many ways you can use redstone contraptions to protect entrances to your bases.




Here are a few pointers on defenses:
