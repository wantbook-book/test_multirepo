### The Star Spangled Banner
The following song is the first part of The United States National Anthem. Exact instructions are not included this time, so use your knowledge from the previous two songs, and look up notes/rhythms on the chart in the section titled "Translating Real Music to Minecraft Note Blocks," so that you can figure out how to tune the note blocks, how many repeaters go in between the note blocks, and what delay they are set to.

Tip: The tempo is 75, meaning that a quarter note is equal to 8 ticks, or 2 repeaters, both set to full delay.

The only instrument that has the full range of the song is harp/piano. This means that the block under each note block must be something other than wood, sand, gravel, soul sand, concrete, glass, stone, brick, gold, clay, packed ice, wool, or a bone block.

Follow the steps, in order, and use the chart in the section titled "Translating Real Music to Minecraft Note Blocks" to translate the pitches and rhythms into redstone music.

## External software

One of the many ways to create note block songs is to use external software.

### Note Block Studio
See also: Programs and editors/Minecraft Note Block Studio

You can convert any song you want into a set of note blocks using an external application called Note Block Studio created by Davve.
This method also requires MCEdit to import the result into your world.

1. First of all you need a midi version of your song. A specifically-made midi version is preferred; if there are no available midi versions, you can try certain converters to convert your mp3 files to midi, but the result is often not satisfactory.
2. Second, you should open your song in Note Block Studio, which can be done by pressing 'Load' then find your.midifile and import it.
3. Then play it to see how it sounds. If, in the top right, it mentions that the input is 'Not compatible', you can fix this by clicking the button and then pressing 'Fix'.
4. Now go to File → Export as Schematic, and choose your own options there.
5. Open your world in MCEdit and Import the Schematic you just exported and place it wherever you want in your world. Wait for it to load.
6. PressCtrl+Sto save your world. Close MCEdit, and open up your Minecraft world.
