### Axe
- Style: Offensive, direct
- Range: Melee
- Damage: Varies with material

The axe’s and usefulness varies between the two versions of Minecraft.

In Java Edition, axes deal much higher damage(a wooden axe deals the same damage as a diamond sword) compared to swords and have the ability to disable shields for 5 seconds. However, they attack 1x a second, while a sword can attack faster at 1.6x a second. Also, axes are unable to deal sweeping attacks, making them less effective than swords against multiple mobs.

In Bedrock Edition, axes deal half a heart less damage than their sword counterpart and do not disable shields.

In both versions, axes cannot be enchanted with Fire Aspect and cost 1 more of the material to make than the sword.

Axes use 2 durability every time it is used as a weapon, so they have much lower lifetime damage compared to swords.

Overall, the usefulness of an axe depends on your version. In Java Edition, even though the damage is higher, the sword of the same material does more damage per second (DPS). However, axes can be used to deal more damage in a single blow, and are useful in certain cases, like starting out in a Survival world, or in player-versus-player (PvP) combat due to their ability to disable shields. In Bedrock Edition, axes are completely inferior to the sword, because they do 1 less damage than a sword of the same material and have no benefits.

### Trident
- Style: Offensive, direct
- Range: Ranged/Melee
- Damage: 8-9

The trident is hard to obtain, but can be used both as a ranged weapon and melee weapon. 

Trident can be thrown as a ranged attack, but unless it has been enchanted with Loyalty, the player will have to retrieve it in order to use it again. When used as a melee weapon the damage depends on the version. In Java Edition, it does about the same damage as an axe but has a lesser attack cooldown. In Bedrock Edition, it does the same damage as a netherite sword.

###  Tools
- Style: Offensive, direct
- Examples: Shovels, Pickaxes
- Range: Melee
- Damage: Varies with type and material

When a player is out performing tasks in the world, they might not have a sword/axe or set a sword/axe in their hotbar. Shovels and pickaxes can also be used to deal damage when a sword or axe cannot be drawn. Different tools and weapons have different attack strength and attack speed. However most tools apart from swords or axes are highly inefficient when combating mobs and should be used only as a last resort.

### Bow
- Style: Offensive, direct
- Range: Ranged
- Damage: no charge: 1, medium charge: 6, high charge: 9–10 damage

The bow is the easiest to use, and most widely employed ranged weapon in the game. However, it requires arrows as ammunition. Enchanting a bow with Infinity can sidestep the ammunition problem, as wielding one arrow is enough for infinite shots, limited only by the weapon's durability. Infinity can also prevent one's opponents from picking up the missed arrows to use as ammunition of their own. Other bow enchantments will greatly enhance the bow's attacking power, allowing it to deal more than ten hearts per shot.

Although bows are very useful weapons in most land combat situations, they do not work well in water or lava. When shot through fluids, arrows will drop downward after traveling 4 blocks from the player, making underwater archery useless and sometimes dangerous (players can be hit by their own arrows). Additionally, they do not work against other players very well because Shields can be used to block arrows easily.

This makes bows useful for ranged fights, if you are fighting a mob thats not near you.

### Crossbow
- Style: Offensive, direct
- Range: Ranged
- Damage: 6–11 damage

The crossbow is similar to the bow, but more powerful, and shoots arrows with more velocity, though it has a longer charge time. It requires arrows or firework rockets as ammunition. Enchanting a crossbow with Quick Charge can sidestep the reload time problem, as charging crossbows with Quick Charge III is faster than fully charging a bow. Other enchantments which greatly enhance the crossbow are Multishot and Piercing, which are useful for attacking multiple enemies. Although crossbows can't be enchanted with Power, Multishot can help when the player shoots as close as possible, so the opponent will get hit by 3 arrows at once with each arrow dealing 6-11 damage. Even though the crossbow cannot be enchanted with Infinity, Multishot fires 3 arrows, but only one can be picked up, so as long as only two arrows hit enemies, the player can still retrieve the third arrow (it also works for tipped arrows as well). The same goes for the Piercing enchantment: as long as an arrow or tipped arrow passes through mobs, the player may retrieve it from where it lands.

The crossbow can also use firework rockets as ammunition. Firework stars with an explosion effect deal 5-6 damage with 1-2 additional damage per an extra firework star, and up to 7 firework stars can be used. The mean firework rocket damage ranges between 11-18, which deals splash area and can damage endermen and the wither during its projectile armor phase. Additionally, each firework star can be dyed (with a large ball effect), which may obscure another player's vision (due to the particles color). However, firework rockets are much harder to use in Bedrock Edition as they don't explode immediately upon impact with mobs or blocks, severely reducing their effectiveness in combat. They can also be expensive, requiring from 2⁄3 to 2 2⁄3 pieces of gunpowder per rocket.

Due to the crossbow's ability to keep an arrow loaded whether it's held in hand or kept in the inventory, the player can have 9 hotbar slots full of loaded crossbows and can do rapid shooting. With each crossbow having the Multishot enchantment, it will shoot even more arrows, which is very useful when shooting multiple crowded mobs, or a boss mob. This also works with firework rockets.

Although crossbows are very useful weapons in most land combat situations, they do not work well in water or lava. When shot through fluids, arrows will drop downward after traveling 4 blocks from the player, making underwater archery useless.
