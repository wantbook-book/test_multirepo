- Placing abedis one of the basic things to do to your shelter, as this will make it your newspawnpoint, and it provides a unique opportunity to skip thenight.
- Passive mobs such ascowsandpigsshould be killed on sight to get their resources, as you will not have time to set up an animal farm.
- Make sure your shelter is properly lit. If you don't, then you'll probably have the living daylights scared out of you when you hear the hissing sound of acreeperright beside you. However, mobs don't always spawn when you are in a bed, assuming you sleep as soon as you are able. Note that things like wheat, trees and other stuff won't grow any quicker when sleeping. It's only the time of day that is skipped.
- It's always a good idea to have a hole in the wall of your shelter, or have aclockwith you. That way, you'll be able to see when it's day again. Remember thatspiderscan't enter holes one block in width, thoughcave spiderscan. However, creepers can see you through the hole and may explode if you are close enough to the hole, so be careful in small shelters.
- You can useglassfor windows, but 16glass panescan be made from 6 glass blocks, so glass panes are a more economic choice. Using glass is a luxury and will be a waste of resources and time as you cannot retrieve any glass after placing them unless you have a silk touch tool. You can obtain both glass and glass panes with silk touch.
- If you have enough to do so, use fences as windows, as you can see out and mobs cannot see in. This does not work on spiders, though.[verify]
- Make some shears. Always shear sheep of their wool, so you can keep your previous bed where it is. This way, if you die, you won't spawn back at the world spawn.
- Horses and donkeys spawn in plains biomes. If you are lucky enough to find a saddle, you can tame and ride a horse or donkey, greatly increasing your travel speed.
- If you cannot find a saddle, you can try fishing, which will give you a good food source as well as the chance to get saddles.
- If you find a donkey you can attach a chest to it, allowing for extra mobile inventory space.
- Shulker Boxes are one of the best ways to maximize your storage.
- If you are using a donkey consider using F3 to plan your route. Following a line (i.e.: "x increases, z stays 0") can help you get back to your donkey if you die (assuming you're leaving your bed behind every night and building a new one so you spawn there and not back at the worldspawn). If you do follow a line during your nomadic experience consider starting your journey from the Origin (x=0 z=0). A quick teleport code at the beginning of the game can get you there no matter where the original spawn was, and you can use /setworldspawn once you get there to make the origin the worldspawn.
- Llamas spawn in mountains and plateau variants of biomes, and can transport up to 150 items per lead you use thanks to their ability to form caravans.
- You should consider using the cheat code/gamerule keepInventory true. This will make it so you don't lose anything when killed. Not only will you not drop any of your items, but you also won't lose experience points because that would count as â€œdropping experience orbs". It does however take the sting out of dying, to the point where some players may find the game less interesting that way.
- Lastly, for a real challenge, consider playing nomad style onhardcore.
