## Dawn
Wherever you spawn in the world, there are several different landscapes all around you. Your goal is to gather all the resources you need before nighttime comes and monsters can spawn.

### Minute Zero
0:00–0:15

It is best to create a temporary landmark to indicate the spawn location before you move at all. This might help you in the future in case you ever get lost, so mark it in whichever way you can. If you spawn on land, the easiest way is to dig the blocks adjacent to the block you are standing on and then place one on top of the other to form a pillar below your feet. See pillar jumping for more detail. Build the marker on nearby high ground, and build it high enough to be seen from a distance over any nearby obstacles. Next, look around and take note of your surroundings. See if there are any trees around you. There is a spawn chunk region, and you respawn anywhere within that region if you die. This region has special importance in the game, and you want to lay down enough markings to be able to identify it later. (Pro-tip for direction finding: you are always facing north at the start of the game. Pressing F3 to open the debug screen, and looking on the left side of the text also tells you where you are facing, as well as your x, y, and z coordinates, which you might want to write down.‌[JE  only])

0:20–1:00

Walk towards trees. If you do not see any trees, pick a random direction (but note the direction; the sun has just risen and is directly east, which you can also check in the Debug/F3 screen ‌[JE  only]) and walk. If you are on an island, surrounded by water, swim towards land. Throughout the first day, it's recommended to hit any short grass you come across as seeds are going to come in handy later on for Hunger. If you are in the jungle, keep an eye open for a big green melon and punch it if you see one. Also, take note of food sources such as animals, as well as small caves as shelter, as they become useful later on. If you have spawned in a plains, savanna, desert, taiga, snowy taiga‌[BE  only], or snowy tundra biome, you may come across a village. Villages have houses and villagers that can be used for trading with later on. Villager houses may contain basic food supplies such as bread, seeds, carrots, potatoes and beetroots, even melons or pumpkins, and hay bales which you can craft into wheat and then into bread. A weaponsmith contains a chest with excellent chest loot like iron. Villages also contain beds that allow you to reset your spawn point and avoid the effects of insomnia. A village can be a good start to building your own shelter early or late game, particularly in challenging biomes like desert or tundra.

### Minute One
1:00–2:00

If you still do not see trees, and particularly if you don't see any dirt or grass blocks, then start collecting sand (in a desert) or snow (in the tundra, although this requires obtaining a shovel) as shelter materials, as much as you can get, for 20 seconds, then move on. If you are still swimming, keep at it. If you do see a tree, cut it down by holding down destroy and collect all of the logs. After breaking down the logs from the tree, the leaves will automatically decay after a few minutes; if you don't want to wait you can always break the leaves and collect the saplings and apples that drop from the leaves, if there are any.

You should keep your eyes and ears open for animals such as chickens, cows, sheep, pigs, for food. You should see some animals in a couple of minutes. In some biomes wolves will spawn which can be domesticated at a later point in time with bones. You don't want to punch the wolves by accident. If you do, they become hostile.

### Minute Two
2:00–2:10

The next step after finding wood is to make a crafting table. If you have not found trees yet (or a village) keep moving until you do. If you have not found either after 5 minutes, you should stop and make a basic shelter (see next section). 

To make a crafting table, first open your inventory by pressing E. Put one piece of log anywhere in the 2×2 crafting slot near the top of your inventory. In the output box to the right of that, 4 planks appear. Take the planks, and put 1 in each slot of the crafting area. The output should now be a crafting table.

Put the crafting table anywhere in your hotbar (the 9 slots at the bottom of your inventory), and place it down with a right-click, and right-click again to open it.

2:10-3:00


Make a wooden pickaxe and a wooden axe. First, you need to make sticks. (1 log = 4 planks = 8 sticks) This lets you get cobblestone and progress to better tools.

You should also make a boat if you're still on an island with very limited resources, which can be crafted with 5 planks.
