# Cape
Capes are commemorative items that can be worn in addition to the player's skin. However, unlike skins, players cannot create custom capes or transfer any owned capes to a different account. When equipped, they also change the appearance of a worn elytra. Capes are purely decorational, and do not alter the wearers' capabilities in any way.

Various mods, such as OptiFine, Essential, and other third party clients have allowed players to obtain capes, some allowing custom designs in the form of banner patterns. These capes are however not official and are only visible to the player with the mod installed (or, in most cases, other users of the mod). Only official capes, that can be seen by everyone, are listed in this article.

### Java Edition
The only capes that can be obtained on one's own, so far, in Java Edition are the migrator cape, which comes from migrating a Mojang account to a Microsoft account, the vanilla cape, which comes from owning both Java Edition and Bedrock Edition in the same Microsoft account prior to June 6, 2022, and the cherry blossom cape, which comes from participating for the Mob Vote for Minecraft Live 2023. The rest cannot be obtained by players through any in-game means and are therefore considerably rarer.

MINECON capes before Minecon Earth 2017 were obtained by attending or buying a ticket to the year's MINECON. Minecraft events from 2017 and onward are done via a livestream available to everyone and no capes are given out anymore, with the exception of Minecraft Live 2023, where players were given the cherry blossom cape from voting in the Mob Vote. On May 12, 2020, Mojang disabled all unused MINECON cape links used to obtain the capes of years 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016. Only a few thousand players around the world have a MINECON cape.

Other less common types of capes have manually been given out by Mojang to select few members of the community throughout the years. Some of the people who have those capes include Mojang staff themselves, volunteers in various programs as well as individuals whose impact was recognized by Mojang. Only a few hundred players around the world have such a cape, with some capes being owned by a single individual only.

Players of Java Edition can equip or unequip certain capes for their skin via the Minecraft Launcher or their Minecraft profile.

### Bedrock Edition
Unlike Java Edition, in Bedrock Edition, capes are much more common items with skins from various skin packs having capes integrated to them. One skin pack made available to every player is the MINECON 2016 skin pack that contains all five MINECON cape designs from Java Edition up to 2016. A cape celebrating Minecon Live 2019 was available in Bedrock Edition to promote the character creator, though it was obtainable by everyone regardless of whether they watched the event or not. Other capes made available to every player are the pan cape and the progress pride cape. Players who owned both Java Edition and Bedrock Edition on the same Microsoft account prior to June 6, 2022, were also given the vanilla cape. Some employees also have special capes in Bedrock Edition, similarly to Java Edition. 

Players of Bedrock Edition can equip or unequip certain capes for their skin via the character creator.
