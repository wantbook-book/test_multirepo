Mining both straight up or down are definitely some of the riskiest things a player can do, because both can carry to dangerous and most likely lethal situations. 

For example, if the player is mining straight down by mining the block they are standing on, there is a chance of:

- Falling into a pool oflava, which can randomly generate underground, as under Y=10 (1.17 and earlier) all caves are completely filled with lava
- Accidentally breaking into acavesystem, undergroundravines, ormonster roomsand taking significant fall damage along with possibly getting swarmed bymobs
- The player can also get stuck in the hole they just dug. In that case, placing ladders orpillar jumpingshould get the player out.

Safer ways to dig downward include:

- Mining in a staircase pattern
- Finding an open-mouth cave on the surfaceMining In A Dripstone Cave (left) Strip Mine (right)
- Placingladdersorscaffoldingwhile digging
- Digging a 2×1 hole while standing between both blocks or on the block opposite the one being mined
- Strip mining (Digging down in a staircase pattern then changing to a horizontal 1×2 pattern)
- Repeating the steps of digging down 3 blocks from the surface, placing a ladder on the bottom block, standing on that ladder, then mining the blocks below
- Digging straight down, but turning up your volume, listening for lava and mobs, and regularly placing ladders

Should the player insist on digging narrow shafts downward, they should try to listen for water, lava or mob sounds (this can be aided by turning on subtitles). This can alert the player to the presence of a cavern, lava, or mobs.

Almost as dangerous as mining the block the player is standing on is mining the block right above the player's head. Dangers of mining straight up include: 

- Lava, which could burn the player and their items. This is especially dangerous in the Nether, as in that dimension, random lava pockets generate in the terrain, and lava flows half as fast as water does in the Overworld.
- Water, which could drown the player if the pool generated with a low ceiling and no other escape routes
- Acaveormonster roomwithhostile mobs, which attack the player on sight. While this would normally be a little problem for experienced players, the added element of surprise means that the player may not be able to react in time.
- Gravelorsand, which couldsuffocatethe player

A possible way to make mining upward safer would be for the player to place a torch at their feet and keep a block in their hotbar that they can switch to easily. The torch breaks any gravel or sand that falls onto it and if liquid comes out of the hole, they can quickly place a block to stop the flow of the liquid. These precautions are not perfect as there still is the possibility of mining into a cave with mobs or the player not reacting fast enough to a lava flow (especially in the Nether where Lava flows half as quickly as water). As with digging straight down, the player should be wary of noises (mobs, water, lava, etc.) or particle effects (specifically, water/lava dripping from a block) which may signify the presence of lava, water, hostile mobs or a cave.

#### Desert Temples
The player should never dig straight down in the center (the blue terracotta block) of a desert pyramid. Doing so results in the player falling directly onto a pressure plate and triggering a concealed TNT trap, which explodes. This can kill the player, destroy their items, and destroy the chests and their contents. There are safer alternatives to get down and back up:

- The simplest and quickest way is to dig a channel straight down the sidewall, collecting the sand blocks on the way down. To ascend again, jump while replacing the blocks underfoot.
- Dig down in a staircase fashion, and simply walk up the stairs to ascend back up.
- Use a bucket of water to fall down to the treasure room at a lower speed, making it easier to avoid the pressure plate. Ascending can be done by digging stairs or placing ladders.
- Mining the pressure plate and/or TNT after falling down the side of the pit.

Once at the bottom, the player can safely mine the pressure plate, harvest the TNT, and loot the chests.

#### Careless underwater digging
In Survival mode, blocks take five times as long to break while the player is underwater. Therefore, there is a high risk of drowning while digging underwater, especially if the player is not close to the surface. Digging an air pocket under the ocean floor or placing magma blocks or soul sand to create a bubble column can produce a place where the player can slowly recover their air supply. In Java Edition, placing a door on the ocean floor creates an air pocket where the player can stand. It takes time to recover the breath meter so players should come prepared.

Should the player need to dig underwater for long periods of time, a helmet enchanted with Aqua Affinity and/or Respiration, a turtle shell, or a Water Breathing potion can be used. A conduit can also be built if the player expects to be underwater even longer. The player should be careful near ocean monuments, as the elder guardians inflict Mining Fatigue III, drastically reducing mining speed.

Finally, players may want to have light underwater. Torches  cannot be placed underwater, so it is better for the player to come with full-block light sources such as sea lanterns, glowstone, lanterns, sea pickles, jack o'lanterns, a redstone lamp beside a block of redstone or a magnesium torch.‌[BE & edu  only]

#### TNT
An example of carelessness with TNT. (Click to play the GIF.)
TNT explosions are deadly. Whenever possible, the player should use redstone wiring and repeaters to delay the explosion and/or remotely detonate the TNT. Should the player happen to have a bow enchanted with the Flame enchantment, they can also remotely detonate the TNT by shooting it. If necessary, the player should find cover to protect themselves from the explosion. If flint and steel must be used, run away as quickly as possible.

TNT also affects the nearby environment. If there are multiple blocks of it, the first explosion launches the others in random directions due to them being entities when primed. This means that even placing it a reasonable distance away may still mean your base is partially blown up.

Additionally, large TNT explosions can result in severe lag, and possibly freezing and crashing.

It is recommended to wear armor while using TNT, especially armor enchanted with Blast Protection. Feather Falling reduces the fall damage if you are blasted into the air. It is also recommended to use a totem of undying in the offhand and water bucket in case of a fall from high altitudes.
