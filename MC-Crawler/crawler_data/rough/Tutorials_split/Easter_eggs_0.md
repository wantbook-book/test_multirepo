## Seasonal events
### Halloween
Between October 20 and November 3, bats can spawn at a light level of 6 or less instead of the normal light level 3 or less.

On October 31, zombies, zombie villagers, husks, drowned, skeletons, strays, zombified piglins, and wither skeletons have a 22.5% chance to wear carved pumpkins and a 2.5% chance to wear jack o'lanterns on their heads. This feature was added in Java Edition 1.4.2 for Halloween 2012 and every Halloween thereafter.

Also, the only splash text shown is "OOoooOOOoooo! Spooky!"

- A zombie with a pumpkin on its head.
- A spider jockey with a pumpkin.
- A wither skeleton with a jack o'lantern.
- Zombie and skeleton wearing a pumpkin.
- "OOoooOOOoooo! Spooky!" splash.

### Christmas
Main articles: Chest § Christmas chest and Java Edition mentioned features § Joke features
From December 24–26, chests, large chests, trapped chests, and minecarts with chest have their textures changed to Christmas chests that resemble wrapped Christmas presents. This was added in Java Edition 1.4.6 for Christmas 2012. A texture file called "skis.png" was also added in Java Edition 1.4.6 in the same folder as the Christmas chests, but it was added by Dinnerbone as a red herring. This was re-added for Christmas 2013,[1] along with a new "rain feature"—pigs riding chickens (this is not planned to be fully implemented). This also happened again in 2014 with a new splash reading, "Merry X-Mas!" and repeated in every Christmas since.

The change doesn't apply to boats with chests.[2]

- "Merry X-mas!" splash.
- skis.png
- Normal chests.
- Large chests.

## 
### Cake





In 1.14.2-pre2 and for the occasion of the 10 years of Minecraft's release on May 17, 2019, the cake had a big "10" placed like candles, and the only splash text that appeared was "Turning 10 years old!"[3] This was reverted to the way they were before on May 20, 2019, and is unable to be seen again in-game even when going back to 1.14.2-pre2 and changing the time of the device to May 17-20 of 2019.

| Models         |
|----------------|
| Full cake      |
| 1 slice eaten  |
| 2 slices eaten |
| 3 slices eaten |

### Thing banner pattern
A "Thing" banner pattern can be crafted using an enchanted golden apple and paper. When put on a banner, it displays Mojang Studios' old logo in whatever color dye was used. It is labeled "Thing" in the inventory. The Swedish word "mojäng" means gadget or thing.

### Withers on blocks
The wither can be spotted in two blocks. A 2×2 painting shows the soulsand T-shape and the three wither skeleton skulls. The chiseled red sandstone block depicts the wither on the edges of the block.

## Textures
Some textures have hidden things in space unused by the game. Some of these are accessible by unzipping client.jar found in the versions folder.

### Guardian
Before the Texture Update, in the guardian and elder guardian textures, there was an unused area saying "jeb".

- Elder guardian.
- Normal guardian.

### Armor stand
In the texture for the armor stand, in an unused area in the bottom right, the word "Searge" can be seen in a black box. This is presumably put there as a signature by Searge, the developer that implemented armor stands. In the bottom left, the word "Jappa" can be seen. This is likely another signature, this time from the texture artist, Jappa, who was in charge of the Texture Update.

- Armor stand texture.
- Armor stand texture after the texture update.

### Zombie pigman
Before the Texture Update, in an unused area for the zombie pigman texture, the words "THX XAPHOBIA" could be seen. This was written by Notch to give credit and thanks to the original creator of the texture, XaPhobia.[4][5]

- Zombie pigman texture.
