### Double Booster
This is a way that you can put two carts into one, which is believed to more than double the distance you can get out of your booster.

In order to make the double booster, you need to put a block, then a piece of track (may require two tracks in order to align the cart correctly) above the cart to be doubled and place a cart on that track.  



Next remove the block. This will drop the first cart into the second, merging them. At least, until they fall off the track. 



You can also ride "them" and they'll move nearly forever if there is no dead end. It also moves slower off track and can move through water.



Here is another way to create the double booster. The carts will collide and merge partially, creating the same effect as the double booster explained above. This version, however, can be used automatically since there is no need dig any blocks. Using this method you can also merge more that two carts, but the results will usually be more or less unstable.

### Spin Booster
This is a simple principle, it involves 4 minecart tracks, and 2 minecarts. You put the 4 tracks in a circle, and then place 1 minecart on a track in that circle, and place the other one opposite. Then, put your track for transport next to it. When a minecart is pushed into it, it boosts it. PLEASE NOTE the minecarts sometimes have to be replaced.

Another method of Spin Boosting is to use 8 minecart tracks and 5 minecarts. This is easier to determine the direction the booster will take effect.

This method should be avoided in multiplayer as it creates high amounts of lag.

Spin boosters still work in modern versions of the game, but generally require more carts and don't provide as large of a boost.



### Triple Booster
Possibly the simplest booster (recommended for long, level tracks) only requires a single track and three minecarts. Line the carts up on the track and push the rear one into the other two repeatedly, and at least two of the carts will lock together and boost each other continuously until they reach their destination. This is a bug that seems to have to do with the carts hitting each other, so this may take a few attempts. As such, it's recommended to make the rear cart a Powered Minecart and start it with a few coal, then jump in the front cart so you don't get left behind. The powered cart will knock into the other two until the bug kicks in.

### C-Booster
The C-Booster, also known as the collision booster, is a relatively small booster that produces max speed and momentum instantly, allowing fast uphill travel and instant speed. To make one, dig two trenches in the ground, both one block deep, two blocks wide, and 1 block in length. These trenches/lines must be parallel. Place minecart tracks inside them, then link them together in the area in the center by placing a line of track. Cover the trenches with any block, and place two minecarts per line of track. You should now have four closely compacted minecarts. If another minecart directly approaches it and bumps into a minecart inside the C-Booster, it will instantly accelerate in the opposite direction at max speed and max momentum.


The direction of the boost may change randomly.

### Reverse Double-V Booster
This booster is a booster where you get blasted out the same way you come in very powerfully. It is auto-resetting.





### Multiplayer Tips
Certain types of boosters should be avoided in multiplayer, as they can cause lag or may work unreliably.

- Don't use always-moving boosters, such as spin boosters. Use launchers instead, as these cause less lag due to not having to constantly update the minecarts.
- Check the rules: Some servers may disallow boosters and launchers entirely, and/or have mods installed to replace this functionality.
