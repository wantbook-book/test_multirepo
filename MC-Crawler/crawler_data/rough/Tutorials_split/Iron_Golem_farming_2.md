### Survival mode build: Iron golem village
A village converted to an iron farm.
A village can be converted into an iron golem farm that requires no exotic materials, but patience and time to set up. It can be constructed early on in the game for an early source of iron, up to 200 ingots/hour with no optimization techniques; not the maximum rate but sufficient for any early-game iron needs.

The village functions normally and produces iron at the same time, without needing to transport, enslave, or imprison villagers. The villagers are free to roam and work, and every night they make their way over the bridges into the cobblestone bunker to sleep. The building has 20 beds in two floors, with a stairway between the floors and a path around the beds. 

** Materials **
The farm requires some basic tools: a bucket for both water and lava, one hopper, a large amount of torches, and several stone or iron pickaxes. Collecting all the required building materials is time consuming: primarily wood, wool, and cobblestone. It is best to collect your materials far away from the village. Trying to gather all the materials too near the village risks attracting zombies that can kill the villagers. You can estimate the number of fences you need by walking around the village perimeter; it is likely to require at least 4 stacks of fences (with a few fence gates) to make the village escape-proof and entry-proof, and 3 stacks of torches for adequate lighting. 

** Preparation **
An L-shaped village works best, with the farm built in the crook of the "L" so that the beds are sufficiently near the villagers' job sites for the villagers to pathfind between their beds and their job sites. The biome should be reasonably flat, like plains or savanna.

First fence in the village and light it up, and add a few beds to encourage the villagers to breed while building the farm, which can take a while. Remove any high blocks near the outside of the fence, to prevent hostile mobs from entering the fenced-in area. Once the village is fenced in, you don't have to worry about villagers interfering with your work, which happens outside the fence in the crook of the "L". Proper lighting also prevents any hostile mobs from spawning in the village.

Preparation matters. All it takes is one zombie to get into the community bedroom and you end up with a village full of zombie villagers. Moving the beds into the sleeping bunker to start the farm is the last step!

** Construction **
Construction involves building the sleeping bunker with two floors (and a stairway between them) with 10 beds on each floor, at least one doorway to a bridge that rises up high enough to fit an iron golem underneath (the screenshot shows a bunker with two bridges for easier pathfinding), and making 7-8 blocks of spawning area all around the bunker. The lowest part of the spawning platform should be less than 6 blocks below the top floor of the bunker; starting level with the lowest floor would be sufficient. The rest is just water management and building channels to guide the iron golems into a killing area, which requires a block of lava, a hopper, and a collection chest.

Hostile mobs cannot spawn inside the fenced-in village, but they are free to wander into the farm from outside the fence (or even spawn on top of the sleeping bunker), and get swept into the mob grinder underground. This happens seldom, but you may find an occasional bone, arrow, rotten flesh, and other odd items in the collection chest.
