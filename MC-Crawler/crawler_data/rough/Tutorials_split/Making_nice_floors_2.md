### With Glazed Terracotta
Main article: Tutorials/Glazed terracotta patterns
Glazed terracotta is great when used to highlight certain parts of a floor, specifically in a castle or royal house. What makes glazed terracotta unique from other blocks, is that different textures and colors are shown throughout the block, unlike most blocks, which are one color throughout. Lime glazed terracotta is great for a royal-looking floor, while red glazed terracotta is great for a fancy carpet. Orange-glazed terracotta is great for a beach-hut floor, or the floor for a party place.

One option for glazed terracotta is to substitute the blocks in the wool/concrete patterns for glazed terracotta, to give it a more fancy feel. Here is an example of using glazed terracotta for the wool/concrete pattern 1:

### With Glass
Glass will not just make a nice floor, but also useful in combat and bases, since mobs won't spawn on glass. Here is a simple design:

## Floors for Rooms
If you are making a house and have plenty of materials at hand, you will probably have multiple rooms. Certain types of floors fit perfectly with a certain style of room, while others don't. Here is a list of rooms you will probably have in your house (specifically if you're in survival), and what type of floor would go best with them (note: not all of them have been mentioned):

Foyer/Living room

Your foyer is the room when you first walk into the house, and many players make it their living room. Using the wool pattern 1 with blue/lime/yellow wool, or a glazed terracotta pattern, would look great to get a visitor's attention. You can also surround the wool/glazed terracotta with either plain wood planks or with horizontal wood logs and wood planks (see the first image in "Gallery" for an example).

Kitchen/Smelting room/Dining room

The place where your smelting and managing food is done would look best with the tile-like floor, consisting of polished andesite and polished granite. Also, for a less subtle flooring, use the concrete pattern 1, with black and white concrete. If you have a separate kitchen and smelting room, use the tile-like floor for the kitchen, and for the smelting room, use (a) block(s) of your choice, or you could use the tile-like floor or black/white concrete floor for the smelting room as well.

Bedroom

Your bedroom is a room where you should make the floor your own. You can use whichever block is your favorite, or use one that fits your playing style. Additionally, you can also theme your bedroom. For example, if you're making your bedroom a water/ice theme, use the wool pattern 1 with cyan/green/light blue wool, or just dark prismarine. It's all up to you.

Crafting room

Although many players make the crafting room part of their bedroom, living room, or smelting room, while others have none at all, some players with bigger houses may have a separate crafting room. A crafting room looks great with any of the combinations of wood and wood planks, or if you don't care about a fancy crafting room and want to use minimal wood, only use wood planks.

Storage room

For a storage room, a lot of the floor design is up to you, similar to a bedroom. If you have an above-ground storage room and you want it to look nice, try using wood, wood planks, or stone bricks. If your storage room is in the basement, and you want the floor to not look quite as nice for a realistic basement look, use cobblestone, or for an even more worn down look, the eroding floor design, with andesite and diorite. Additionally, many players make their storage room part of their bedroom.

Note that just because one type of flooring for a room is recommended, it does NOT mean that you must use that floor for every house you build. The flooring for your own house is completely up to you; these floorings are just suggestions.
