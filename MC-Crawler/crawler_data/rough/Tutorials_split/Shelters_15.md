### Jail
The jail is where rule-breakers or criminals go if the punishment agreed on is not an execution/banishment/ban. Build a secure room with traps outside cells to prevent criminals from escaping, via bugs and digging, like lava flowing from the top of the jail. It is difficult to make a secure jail without using Bedrock or obsidian. An alternative is to have the walls of the room constantly being moved by pistons, so the player has no time to break through them. However, this creates a lot of lag. You can make a regenerating wall using water and lava as well. Be warned, however, that if the spawn is outside the jail, the criminal can use the /kill command to escape or blow themselves up with TNT. Also, remember to never send an admin to jail without reverting their admin status first or they can just switch themselves to creative mode and mine the thing you made the jail out of.

### Restaurant
The restaurant can be a place where people pay in goods or money for you to give them food. You could plop a few chairs down too and make a kitchen full of furnaces and chests full of food. Farms for food and resources can be made behind, around, or even within the restaurant's kitchen area.

### Shop
Simply put a pit with a pressure plate with redstone leading up to a dispenser above the pit where a shopper is standing and when they toss the item you're charging them, the item they want falls down to them. This method is useful on a multiplayer server but can be made on a single player server to make it look nice.

- Armor shop: sells armor for protection.
- Tool shop: sells tools for breaking things faster.
- Potion shop: sells potions for health.
- Food shop: sells food for hunger. Note:Rotten flesh,poisonous potatoes,raw chicken,pufferfishandspider eyeshave food poisoning, so do not sell those in a food shop.
- Weapon shop: sells weapons for killing animals or monsters.

### Trade routes and hubs
Use cobblestone or path blocks to connect trading hubs that you and your fellow players can use. For extra fun you can designate each other jobs and wares, such as merchants, armor makers, and butchers.

### Underground tunnel system
Dig a large series of tunnels underground (preferably clean, square-shaped, and free of obstructions or danger) and light it up to prevent mob spawns. The tunnel system can be built around a main tunnel or hub. Link the tunnel system with mines, caves, shelters, and landmarks that are frequented or owned by you or other players, providing an alternative to above-ground travel and quicker, easier access to mines and certain points of interest. Optional additions include beautification (such as different wall/floor materials or designs), minecart rails, boat canals, horse accessibility, displays (such as aquariums and dioramas), cave access points, designated mineshafts, simple shelters or work stations, and mob farms. This can technically also be built in singleplayer, in case you have multiple mines or places of interest across a wide area, but it serves more of a purpose in multiplayer.

### Central tower
Build a large, tall tower in a central area where most players are located. Players can live on each floor or store items there, but its primary purpose should be to mark the location of the central area. Higher floors may have glass windows or balconies to provide lookouts on each side; access to these top floors should be simple and easy. The top floor should contain an actual signaling method to help players locate it at a distance, such as a beacon, signal campfire, lightning rod, blinking redstone lamp, torches, or simply a tall spire made of blocks or fence poles.

### Basic housing
Build a series of basic houses with the bare essentials (crafting table, furnace, chests, bed). They should preferably be in the same vicinity, either across from each other or connected, and should be rather simple in design and material, with windows and even doors being optional in some cases. Their purpose should be to provide basic temporary housing for new players so they don't have to mooch off others as they start off, with the intent being for each player to eventually move out as they advance and build their own base; however, they may also be used as permanent housing, should a player become accustomed to it. The residents can optionally be taxed by the builder or server owner, who may require payment in (ideally cheap or common) materials or goods in exchange for protection or even the housing itself, with eviction or even the house's razing possible if payment is not given; however, this can be oppressive and unfeasible for new players and is thus not recommended.

## Furniture
If you are bored, or want miscellaneous decorations in any place, add furniture! Tutorials for building furniture can be found at "Tutorials/Furniture".

## Tips
- Build a fence around your house to keep unwanted mobs out. This includes houses on islands, asdrownedcan still attack from the water.
- Dig your own mine under your house, accessible through a stairway or a ladder. This provides a safer, more controlled alternative to finding things through a dark cave where mobs can spawn, though it requires more work and resources since the entire mine must be dug by the player.
- Use different chests for different things to avoid confusion and provide a sense of greater space. For example, one chest can be for stone, another chest can be fordeepslate,andesite,granite, anddiorite, another chest can be for spare tools and armor, so on, so forth.
- Use barrels instead of chests when possible. Barrels do not require a free space above, take up less space, and look rather unique, but they cannot be doubled for greater space like chests can.
