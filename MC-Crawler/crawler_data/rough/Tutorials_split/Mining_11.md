### Special techniques
#### TNT mining
TNT mining is dangerous. If you must do it, you can use the 3-in method: First find a solid stone wall, mine 3 blocks inward, then place 1 block of TNT on the third hollowed out space. Once placed with flint and steel in hand, they right-click it with the flint and steel and back up a few steps and quickly block off the front of the hole with one block of stone. The explosion should create a perfect 3×3×3 hole. Repeat as desired.

A much faster but risky technique is mining in a small alcove, filling it with multiple units of TNT, and igniting it, creating a fairly large cavern. While this variation uncovers a large number of blocks at once, the explosion can let a large amount of lava leak in, making the cave hard to access and burning any drops created by the explosion.

TNT is expensive to manufacture (requiring 4 sand and 5 gunpowder to make 1 TNT), thus another mining technique to maximize the use of each TNT is to dig a 2×1 tunnel 4-5 blocks into the wall, then at head height mine 2-4 blocks (depending on desired size of hole) to their front, right, left, up and down. Place 1 block of dirt to act as a stand for the TNT to explode in the middle. The explosion should create a roughly spherical shaped hole averaging 8 blocks in diameter. This method destroys more blocks per TNT but requires more use from the pickaxe in order to carve the space around the TNT. Since this only creates a single explosion unlike the previous technique, the items dropped from the broken blocks will survive.

This is one of the best ways to get ancient debris, because of it being blast resistant. this will reveal many lava pockets, so it is a good idea to keep a few fire resistance potions on you, you can also use beds, as they explode in the nether when used, but this creates a much larger and more dangerous explosion, as well as setting many of the surrounding blocks on fire.

#### Silverfish Mining
The player can use silverfish to clear a lot of stone away to reveal the valuable stuff. To do this, get a bunch of silverfish in a hole, and position themselves above the hole. Most of the silverfish will go into the stone, but make sure there are at least some left visible. While standing above the leftover silverfish, throw a splash potion of poison, then a splash potion of regeneration immediately after. Every time the poison hurts the silverfish, it will call any nearby silverfish out of the stone, then it will get healed by the regeneration potion, so it can keep getting hurt instead of being pinned at 1 health. Soon, all of the silverfish will come out of the stone, and they can kill them at this point, then mine all of the minerals left behind.

The easiest way to transfer silverfish to different places is by leading them through the Nether. The player can do this by putting a nether portal by a silverfish monster spawner, however they will need a path of blocks they can't enter, and another portal for players, farther away with a different exit. After luring a batch of silverfish through their portal, they go through theirs. The player will have made walls and a trail in advance. The walls and trail contain the silverfish, but lets the player see and follow them without being able to reach them. Two levels with a glass walkway for them above their path can do this, just make sure they can't reach the player's level (and none of the blocks are stone they can enter). Also, they may need to see the player once without glass, so they know where they are. Then lead them to a third portal leading to their mine, and voila, the player have transported them to where they want to mine at.

#### Wither Mining
Another way to get many resources acquired from mining very quickly without having to use up tools or TNT, is to use the wither. The wither, unlike most other mobs, has the ability to break any block that can be mined by the player. In addition, if a block is destroyed by the black or blue skulls of the wither, it will drop itself (see Explosion for more details). However, be very careful when attempting to mine by using the wither when in Survival mode, as the wither has many defenses, and is able to deal a great amount of damage to the player. So, make sure to either have high quality weapons and armor, or make the wither mine so that it is impossible for the wither to attack the player.

#### Piston Mining
Piston mining is a technique for safely extracting small amounts of valuable ores, usually diamonds, and for inserting 'windows' into potentially dangerous spots.

1. Start by digging a 1×2 hole in a safe spot a few blocks to one side of the target area. If no truly safe spot is available, pick a location where the risk is least.
2. Place a block and a piston in the hole. Any block moveable by a piston will do. Glass would allow the player to see hazards without triggering them. An efficient method is to place one block of glass, then use 'filler' material for the subsequent blocks.
3. Dig another hole a few blocks to the other side of the target area, ideally in another safe spot. When doing this, don't forget that the maximum distance a piston can push is twelve blocks in a straight line.
4. Activate the piston using a redstone torch, lever, button or pressure plate as the player prefers.
5. Insert another block, re-open the 'receiving hole' if necessary and reactivate the piston.
6. Repeat until the ore can safely be collected, or the glass block has revealed a hazard or confirmed all is safe. Note that they may need to check several rows before they can be entirely sure there is no danger.
7. Retrieve the piston for reuse.

This mining method is only practical for collecting very small amounts of ore, but it can be useful for collecting diamonds from dangerous spots or when players suspect a natural hazard is nearby and they want to locate it precisely.
