### Charged creepers
See also: Tutorials/Creeper farming § Charging creepers

Charged creepers are much more dangerous than normal ones due to the fact that they have a much larger blast radius with double damage. All strategies that work on their normal variants still work, but the consequences for failure are more drastic.

If you want mob heads, you can let the creeper follow you to a mob. When triggering the explosion, make sure that you are armed with a shield and that the mob is close to the creeper. If the mob dies, it should drop a mob head. To allow yourself to run away without stopping the explosion, trigger the creeper with flint and steel. Mob heads are one of the advantages of thunderstorms, as they allow the collection of heads from certain mobs, which may be unobtainable or scarce otherwise for most variants. Note that only one head can drop per explosion.

### Zombified piglins and witches
Sometimes, lightning will strike in a pig farm or a villager that you have been trading with.

When killed, zombified piglins drop gold nuggets, rotten flesh and, occasionally, their own golden swords. However, they have high melee damage and attack in groups if provoked. To avoid such occurrences, place lightning rods away from the farms.

Witches are always hostile, and use potions. Their potions can be debilitating in the right circumstances, especially since their Poison deals massive amounts of damage and leaves you at 1 until the effect ends.

## Materials needed
If you do decide to go outside in a thunderstorm, here is a list of recommended materials to carry in your inventory:

Note that anything that works for you at night will work in thunderstorms.

- Swordoraxe(preferably iron, diamond, or netherite).
- Trident,Channelingenchantment can be used for mob head farming, whileRiptideenchantment can be used as fast transportation or go to higher place easily.
- Shovel
- Pickaxe
- BoworCrossbow
- Arrows
- Shield(in youroffhandslot)
- Iron, diamond, or netheritearmor.
- At least a half stack of a cheap block, such asDirt, to build pillars or blockades to escape mobs.
- Plenty offood, 2 types is best: one that has a highsaturationvalue, and another that has a highhungervalue.
- Abucketofwater, to put out the larger fires fromlightning.
- A few things such as aLanternor aTorchso that you can light up anywhere that you need to prevent mobs from spawning.

## Avoiding thunderstorms
If you are a less experienced player, are in ultra hardcore mode where health can't regenerate, or just don't want to risk dying, you likely want to avoid thunderstorms. If you have a bed, Minecraft allows you to sleep through thunderstorms, so you can sleep and when you wake up, the thunderstorm will be gone. However, avoiding thunderstorms are more difficult to avoid safely than they seem if you don't have a bed to sleep through it.

First of all, the only border between you and the outside must not be wood, or any other flammable material unless you have a lightning rod. If it is, one lightning strike could set your whole house on fire, which could destroy your home, possibly set you on fire, and allow mobs to get in. If you don't want your house to be burned down, consider making it out of non-flammable material. Otherwise, you will need to completely cover up your house with a material that does not catch fire, such as cobblestone. If you don't mind your house burning down but want a quick way to be enclosed from the outside for your own safety, make a tiny hut around yourself, made of cobblestone, dirt, or another in-expensive non-flammable block. Although wooden doors can catch fire, they will not burn away or spread the flame so you do not have to worry about them.

If you are surrounded by a non-flammable block and you are completely enclosed from the outside, you should be safe. There are a number of things you can do so that you don't get bored. First of all, you can just dig down and start mining, and maybe explore a cave if you find one, but make sure you have enough materials and equipment for safety. Another thing you can do is organize your chests, and start crafting things for when you go outside again. Finally, putting decorations around your house is a great thing to do on a stormy day. If one has an indoor farm, they can also farm during storms. Though as monsters (especially creepers) spawn on the outside, going out after the storm is over may be a bit difficult.
