### False door pit
A false door pit utilises Redstone torches and pressure plated to drop an unsuspecting player

1. Make a regular doorway. The ground blocks should be some form of stone or wood to disguise the pressure plates. Make sure that the door is not on the same block as directly in front of it.
2. Dig a 2×1 hole in front of the door. If the door is placed correctly, there should be no room in front of the door.
3. To the side of the door, dig a 4×2×3 hole.
4. At the top of the pit, place a sticky piston with the ground block in front of it. The piston should not cover up the pit until activated. Repeat at the bottom of the pit.
5. In between the two pistons, place any block and place a Redstone torch facing away from the pistons.
6. Place a single piece of Redstone below the torch.
7. If possible, place a regular piston between the two pistons' arms facing toward the block with the torch on it.
8. 8. Cover up the pit with ground blocks and place the pressure plates! Some parts of the trap may still be visible, you can cover these up with walls.

## Water traps
Water traps use water to suffocate, trap, or push the target. None of these traps will work on zombies, as they will turn into drowned after drowning, instead of dying. Players who use potions of water breathing will also be unaffected.

### Fake water elevator






































Cobblestone can be swapped for obsidian
Make a water elevator using soul sand bubble column, but without an exit at the top. The column will force the unfortunate player upward, where they will be trapped against the ceiling, unable to break their way out because of the fact that blocks break much slower underwater. Cobblestone can be swapped for obsidian. This can also be used reversely, with magma blocks, taking advantage of the fact players cannot swim upward easily. In both cases, the players may not drown since they're in a bubble column, 
or you could make it more dangerous and put a sign with lava on the top but make sure to not have the blocks the lava is touching or is around is not flammable as it will burn.

### Retrieval trap
A trap made with water and dirt which can kill any mob except zombies.
Create a water current that drags the mobs down under a solid block. The current will hold the mobs under until they drown. The loot from the mobs will float, making the collection hard. If you use this trap to kill zombies, they won't die, but will turn into drowned instead. This trap will also not work on skeletons.

### Whirlpool trap
Through clever use of magma blocks, you can pull the target down into water. It should be noted that it's possible to breathe while inside a bubble column, so this trap is not useful for drowning players.


### Pufferfish pit
Dig a 1 block wide, 1 block long, 2 block deep pit with a magma block floor. Replace the 4 adjacent blocks to the air block at the bottom with trapdoors (make sure they open toward the magma so the pufferfish don't escape and die) and open them, then put a pufferfish in each one. Fill the pot with water, and (optional) add an open trapdoor in the hole, which mob AI sees as a solid block. The magma pulls it down and causes fire damage, while the pufferfish poison and damage the mob/player who fell in or was knocked in.

Note: This could be disguised as an elevator to a secret by putting the magma further down.

Resource requirements: 1 magma block, 4 buckets of pufferfish, 4 trapdoors (any), and 2 water buckets.

## Lava traps
Lava traps usually use lava to burn the target, or distract them for an easier kill. Note that most of these traps will destroy the loot.

### Lava staircase trap


























































A lava staircase trap
This trap can be handy for players who want to deal with assailants. The player should lure the target into the staircase for this trap to be most effective.

1. Dig a standard staircase down a way. The tighter the space available the better.
2. After a certain distance, place astone pressure platein the staircase. It's suggested to place it so it blends in. In the schematic, a wooden pressure plate is used for visibility.
3. Placeredstone dustin an upward trail for a certain distance. Make sure it does not look different from any other part of the staircase.
4. Connect the dust to adispenserand put alava bucketinside.

When the target steps on the pressure plate, it will be trapped by the lava running down the staircase. Even if they have Fire Resistance, it will take a long time to wade back up.

This trap can be expanded to make a handy escape mechanism. If you place the pressure plate on the upward side of the dispenser, the lava will flow down onto anyone chasing you. You could also make a hidden escape at the bottom. Just make sure you have a button to remove the lava.

With some clever piston work, the entire trap could be concealed except the pressure plate. Be wary of stepping on the trap yourself or placing the pressure plate in the wrong location.

There are many variations of this trap, so don't be scared to alter elements of it, especially concerning the direction (descending or ascending), who steps on the trap (you or assailant) and more.
