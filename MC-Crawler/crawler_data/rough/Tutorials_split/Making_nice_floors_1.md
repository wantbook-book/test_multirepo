### With Wool or Concrete
Wool and concrete can be used to brighten up floors a bit, and make them colorful. Most colors of wool are fully renewable, and the ingredients to craft concrete are fairly common. Use wool for a more detailed-looking floor, and concrete for a more polished floor.

#### Pattern 1
This wool or concrete pattern is more complicated than any pattern so far. The way its designed is easiest on a square floor, but can be accommodated. If you don't want to worry about accommodating to a non-square rectangular floor, make this pattern in the center of the floor and surround it with another simpler pattern.

Using blue, lime, and yellow wool or concrete

Requirements: 12 blue wool or concrete, 9 lime wool or concrete, 4 yellow wool or concrete

This floor pattern is nice and colorful. It can be built with concrete or wool. There are 2 grids below. The first one shows how a 5×5 floor would use this pattern with concrete, and the second one shows how a 6×6 floor would use this pattern with wool.

You can also switch up the different colors of wool. For example, you can change the yellow wool to lime, the lime to blue, and the blue to yellow if desired.

Using cyan, green, and light blue wool or concrete

Requirements: 12 cyan wool or concrete, 9 green wool or concrete, 4 light blue wool or concrete

This pattern gives a floor aquamarine water feel to it, while still keeping it colorful. As with the previous pattern, the first grid shows a 5×5 floor using this pattern, with concrete, and the second grid shows a 6×6 floor using this pattern, with wool.

#### Pattern 2
Requirements: 13 concrete A, 12 concrete B

This pattern is perhaps the simplest of the 3 wool/concrete patterns. It involves just alternating two colors of concrete for every block. Because this pattern is simple and is nearly the same for any size of flooring, there is only one grid showing how to make this pattern, and it is for a 5×5 floor. This specific example uses black and white concrete:

#### Pattern 3
Note: The requirements here are for a 7 x 7 floor, rather than a 5 x 5 floor.

Requirements: 24 red wool, 16 yellow wool, 8 green wool, 1 blue wool

You can use this rainbow-like pattern to make a very colorful floor. Although it looks the best for at least a 7×7, it can be accommodated to smaller sizes. For bigger sizes, you can add more colors, such as orange and purple. The first grid here shows how you can use this rainbow flooring for a 7×7 floor, and the second grid for a 12×12 floor.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Also, if you want, you can reverse the order of the rainbow colors, so that the red wool is in the middle, and the blue or purple is on the outside.
