## Hard
These homes are complex and some may combine other shelters with large add-ons, making them different shelters like the ones below. 

### Obsidian square
the obsidian square is a large rectangle or square that is up in the sky. The walls, ceiling and floor are 1 block thick and made of obsidian. You can do everything inside of this building. You can make a courtyard or a tower or even a forest depending on your size.

### Materials
- Obsidian
- Beds
- Wooden Planks
- Carpet
- Water Bucket and soul sand (for an elevator)

### Underground Shelter
Description

These shelters are built entirely underground, usually at a depth of 15-25 blocks under the surface.

Tools

- One or more pickaxes (preferably stone) and some shovels.

Advantages of Underground Homes

Building an underground Home has several advantages, especially on multiplayer.

- Underground homes with no visible entrances are hard to find on multiplayer, without knowing the exact coordinates of the place to remove the stone or dirt blocking the entrance to your home. This is useful for preventing players from stealing your items on multiplayer servers.
- Underground bases do not require much building materials or tools—just a pickaxe and a shovel.
- While building an underground base, you are likely to come across iron and coal ores, caves, and maybe even dungeons.
- Underground base owners don't often have to worry aboutcreepersorendermenon the surface.
- Building a mine from an underground home doesn't take nearly as much digging as it would if you were building one from the surface; you may not even need a mine, as you collect minerals while digging out the rooms of a base.
- Simple underground bases are easy to build, and making them more complex isn't hard at all. You'll never have to move because of your home being too small or simple.
- While building an underground base, you don't have to worry about monsters pouring in through openings in your unfinished base, unless you are right over a cavern.
- Underground farming is easier. No animals will come, no fences are needed.
- Since there are no animals spawning in caves, making a minecart rollercoaster is much easier than on land (because the animals may get stuck in the minecart or they might get in the way unless you have it in the air.)
- Due to the time and effort of mining, you will undoubtedly get a large mountain of cobblestone as you dig, potentially being able to turn it into other structures on the surface.
- You could decide to section off part of acavernwhich would considerably reduce mining time!
- When it becomes night time, you can mine and the monsters won't affect you.

Disadvantages of Underground Homes

- When building a mine from an underground base, you will be constantly attacked by aggressive mobs, unless you're frequently placing torches or are on Peaceful mode.
- Accidentally hitting a lava lake while building an underground base can wreak havoc upon you. This would not be a problem in a freestanding home.
- Many griefers target underground homes, especially as they are padded with weak materials. This will leave you susceptible to primed TNT explosions when you enter or exit your house.
- Building an underground home is harder work than a freestanding home, as the player must remove blocks stopping its path to make more rooms.
- You must go above ground to find loot from passive mobs (unless you decide to add amob farmto your home).
- Depending on how complex the house is, it's entirely possible to get lost and need the assistance of an emergency exit.
- Some people have hacked clients, they could turn on X-Ray and find your house, however, this is less likely than somebody raiding a surface home.

Necessary Materials

- Torches
- Ladders

Location

The entrances to this shelter can be anywhere, but in multiplayer, care should be taken to avoid making your location obvious to griefers or thieves. The top of a mountain, the middle of a desert, or even inside another, well-defended shelter are great locations to place the entrance.

Construction

Dig a 2×1 tunnel downwards, placing ladders on the walls every block, and torches in small alcoves to the side. Once a suitable depth has been reached (20 blocks are recommended, but anything below 10 is acceptable. If you dig below level 16, the shelter will work as your mine.), hollow out a chamber. The size of this room is a matter of preference, but a 5×5×2 space is ideal. Light this area with torches, and your rudimentary shelter is complete. Add-ons can be expansions to the original chamber or separate "rooms" of their own. Separate some of the rooms with doors so if a monster does get in, you can hide in another room where you can figure out how to deal with the mobs.

This type of shelter can also be easily converted from the player's first shelter, provided it was built in the ground or in the side of a hill or mountain. The player can expand on this shelter, adding extra rooms and increasing the size of the rooms. Extra rooms can include a main hall, kitchen, bedroom and mine.

Extras

- An escape tunnel: absolutely necessary, as mobs inside your house will spell doom otherwise.
- Connection to mine
- At the base of the ladder, make a pool of water 2 deep so you can just jump down without harm instead of having to go down the ladder.
- Subway/railway station
- Farms (Make sure to have plenty of torches)
- Glass, ice or leaves as roofing to allow sunlight and know the time of day without a clock. Also, it lets you know if mobs await you.
