### Optimal use

Experiment data

A test was conducted by building straight tracks 2000 blocks long on level ground with different intervals of powered rails. The time to travel the full 2 km length on a player/mob occupied minecart was recorded with each interval. The following table lists the results:[2]

The time to travel the full 2 km length is different for all the other minecart type, requiring more powered rails to reach the top speed of 8 m/s. The following table lists the data collected:.[3] Note that the optimal rail spacing for a fully loaded cart differs, see the original reference for details.

Three powered rails in a row on flat terrain is sufficient to boost all minecart types from rest to the maximum speed of 8 m/s.

Thereafter, the optimal spacing of powered rails on a level track is to use 1 every 38 blocks for occupied carts (that is, a repeating pattern of 1 powered rail followed by 37 normal rails, then another powered rail, and so on) which maintains a constant minecart speed of 7.97 m/s. If gold is in short supply, it is possible to use powered rails with more space between them at the cost of reduced overall speed (see above). If you definitely must have the full 8 m/s you should place a powered rail on a level track 1 every 34 blocks for occupied carts.[2]

For all other (utility) minecart types, the optimal spacing of powered rails on a level track is to use 1 every 27 blocks for empty utility carts (1 powered rail followed by 26 normal rails). A full utility minecart requires much more at 1 every 6 blocks.[3]

An optimal use requires the synchronization of minecart movement and powered rail placement; moving a powered rail a single block forward or back along a track can make a significant difference. This is because the momentum of a minecart is increased per tick (=1/20 of a second) the cart spends on a powered rail (by 0.9 m/s for occupied carts). When a cart travels at the maximum 8 m/s on a straight track, it alternately spends either 2 or 3 ticks on each block. For optimal placement, the powered rail must be put where the cart spends 3 ticks, otherwise, one-third of the boost is wasted.

A diagonal track is a track that consists of the pattern 'left corner' attached to a 'right corner' attached to a 'left corner' and so on. When minecarts travel on a diagonal track, the camera is held steady in the diagonal direction and the minecart visually travels diagonally along the track as well. The speed limit of minecarts is actually 8 m/s per cardinal axis, thus when traveling on 2D tracks, the cart travels 8 m/s in both cardinal directions of travel to result in a net vector of about 11.3 m/s or the square root of 128. With a 3D track, you travel as fast as 13.85 m/s or the square root of 192.

Because of this difference, there is also a difference between the optimal spacing of powered rails when used on a 2D track when compared to straight travel on flat terrain. You need powered rail every 53.7225 (rounded to 54) curved rail. This can be worked out through ratios, comparing 8 m/s for 38 rails (the optimal distance for straight rails) to 11.31 m/s to work out the value of 53.7225. Therefore for a combination of straight and curved, a curved rail is equivalent to 0.707 of a straight rail. To maintain maximum speed, you must keep the value under 38. For example one combination could be 31 straight rails with 10 curved rails as this is the equivalent of 38 straight rails.

There is also a difference in unmanned (empty) or storage minecarts, so a shorter interval is needed if these carts are expected on the track.  The optimal pattern to make storage minecarts move quickly is 3:1 (1 powered rail every 4th block).  Compared to shorter intervals, the reduction in speed is minimal. The widest possible interval seems to be 8:1 (power every 9th block) -- any longer, and the minecart does not reliably reach its destination.  In practice, 7:1 may be better, as an 8:1 pattern will have empty carts coming nearly to a stop between the powered rails, and will fail given any interference whatsoever.
