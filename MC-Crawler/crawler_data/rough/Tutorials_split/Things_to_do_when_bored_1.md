## Create redstone circuits
Redstone circuits will open up new areas of Minecraft that are both complex and creative. Almost anything can be made from automatic mob traps to machines that can play music or tell you the time.

## Build something from the real world
Why not build some real world buildings in Minecraft? Choose some buildings in the real world (for example: your home, your school, McDonald's) and build them to the best of your ability. Once created, send the world of these buildings or pictures to your friends. Good luck!



## 
Spleef is an interesting game that can be played on some Minecraft servers. This game is played on top of a lava pool, which has a platform above the lava pool, usually made of snow block, because snow block is destroyed very quickly and cannot be rearranged. Players take the shovel and use them to destroy blocks under other players' feet so they can fall into the lava or defend themselves. Some servers use TNT instead of snow block, and the player holds the flint and steel in their hand and ignites at the TNT under the other player's feet.

## Play with TNT
Dig down to bedrock and build a tower of TNT all the way up, with layers of solid blocks in between(due to TNT becoming an entity when lit). Dig a quick hole down the side for access purposes, then light it all the way up! You can blow up a village and harass the villagers. Note: make sure you're not on other's servers, these actions may be considered griefing.

## Zombies vs. villagers
Make sure that you are in Creative mode. First, make a 3-block tall, 12×12 box with an open top, and then use spawn eggs to spawn some villagers and zombies. Finally, watch the villagers try to survive.

## Defeat mobs
Circle one area, summon 100 creepers, and defeat all the creepers without letting them explode. This will take some time to kill all of them. These will help you in multiplayer, and you can find people who have Creative mode, who can use spawn eggs to summon mobs that you want.

## Summon mobs with commands
The command /summon can be used to spawn unique and interesting mob types. Examples of what a player could create with the command may be an upside-down spider jockey on top of a skeleton or an enderman with bedrock in its hand and a minecart on its head. Other useful commands used to place or modify blocks automatically are /setblock and /fill. The player could use these to create a giant wall or building without having to manually place everything.



## Flying Slow Falling mobs
Note: This only works properly in Bedrock Edition.

Did you know that you can make mobs fly by repeatedly punching them while they have Slow Falling and Regeneration? Probably not! Here is how: 
Step 1: Type in the command /summon minecraft:pig ~ ~ ~. This will summon a pig. 
Step 2: Type in the command /effect @e[type=minecraft:pig] slowness 500 100. This will prevent the pig from moving. 
Step 3: Type in the command /effect @e[type=minecraft:pig] slow_falling 500 3. This will prevent the pig from falling at a normal speed and will instead fall slowly. 
Step 4: Type in the command /effect @e[type=minecraft:pig] regeneration 500 100. This will make the pig regenerate almost instantly after every punch. 
Step 5: Type in the command /effect @s speed 500 2. The speed will make you reach the pig. If you don't type in the command, then you wouldn't reach the pig to punch it anymore and it would likely touch the ground before you would even hit it. 
Step 6: Begin punching the pig with an empty fist. Once you've started punching, don't stop. After a few hits, you will notice that the pig is in mid-air while you keep punching it to constantly be in that state, looking like it's flying. How long can you keep hitting until the pig touches the ground?

Alternatively, if you prefer to do something simpler, you could go to build limit, perform step 3, equip a saddle on the pig, and try to make it 'fly' by using a carrot on a stick.

## Attack a village
If you live not far from a village, why not try to attack it? Blow up the houses, lock up the villagers and take over the whole village. If you in singleplayer, though, watch out for the iron golems.

## Abuse some mobs
This is best done in the superflat map creative mode. Fence an area, summon a bunch of mobs (don't summon flying mobs or mobs that are immune to fall damage) with spawn eggs, equip a fishing rod and fly as high as you want, but don't fly more than 34 blocks off the ground, and then start fishing for these mobs. If the fishing rod hooks a mob, "release" it and make it fly. You could also organize a race with your friends to see who is the best.

You could dig a hole in the ground and pour lava into it and build a tower out of spider webs. Summon a bunch of mobs from the top of the tower (again don't summon mobs that can fly, mobs that are immune to fall damage, or spiders, as all can manage out of the cobwebs) and watch them fall into the lava!

You could also build a small ring rail with powered rails, put in some minecarts and load them with mobs, and get them moving at high speed. Finally, place the block one block high from the rail.
You could also dig a hole at least 3 blocks deep (1×1), summon a bunch of mobs in the hole with a spawn egg, and then put sand or gravel in the hole, watch them suffocate to death!

You could also build a completely enclosed room (with a roof that is closed and dark), fill it with villagers, then put zombies in and watch them get killed.

It wouldn't be so nice though...
