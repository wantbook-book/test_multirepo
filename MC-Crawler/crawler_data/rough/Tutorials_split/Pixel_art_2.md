#### Piano
A piano is one of the more simple real-life objects to build in Minecraft as pixel art, as it is mostly made up of squares rather than round shapes. The coloring is also pretty simple, you just need black and white wool or concrete. Here is an example of how 1 third may look on a piano.

Always remember, the bigger you make something in pixel art (especially for real-life designs), the more precise it looks.

## Map Pixel Art
It is possible to make pixel art using a map. You do this by finding a suitable area, preferably one with few obstructions, and using a map. Find an appropriate area on the map to begin building, and start by laying down blocks in the pattern of whatever you are trying to create, be it a player, an item, a mob or anything you'd like to build. When you're done, you can check the map again. On it, there should be whatever image you tried to create.

If you want to, you can lay down a canvas of solid blocks behind or around the picture to use as a background, but be aware that doing this creates a tremendous shadow beneath the picture. It may also be a good idea to have your picture take a large portion of the center of the map, so there isn't too much whitespace, since that would be a waste. You can even create a pixel-art frame to go around it! Locking the map has the advantage that the pixel art need not be in place in order to appear on the map.

If you're creating some kind of map (the playable kind, not the item), preferably an underground or indoor one, you can use colored blocks to create a "minimap", which is a small map that appears as part of the HUD in some games. You do this by putting a solid-color layer over the top of the area, and tracing the cave's layout using a different block over the top of the solid color layer. You can create labels, other pieces of pixel art and/or different colored blocks to mark certain areas on the minimap. Finally, when the layout is all done, give the player a used map (this time the item kind) to hold in their off-hand slot to use as a minimap as they explore the dark caves or wherever you set the area in. If you want to have the minimap as an actual feature rather than just a map item, you can get a mod or plugin to put a minimap on the HUD, but be aware that the player may not have the mod installed when they play the map if they aren't playing on a server with the mod preinstalled.

You can also use multiple maps to make a bigger map art! You can do this by making as much maps as you want (in a rectangle/square shape). And then filling them with the part of the map art one map at a time. This allows you to make a more detailed map art.
