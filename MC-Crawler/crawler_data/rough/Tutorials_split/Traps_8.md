### Facebreaker trap
1. Make a tower that is at least three blocks high so it will be seen from a distance. This will work best when built in a flat area such as plains or desert. The tower will act as a bait for this trap.
2. Around the tower, dig a pit at least three blocks deep. If you want this trap to be fully automatic, dig the pit at least 30 blocks deep.
3. When the target falls in the pit, dropgravelon the target. If you dug the pit at least 30 blocks deep, this isn't necessary, because most players will die from fall damage anyway.

If done correctly, the gravel blocks should fall on your target's head, thus trapping or killing them. Hence the name facebreaker. Make sure not to take too long or else the target may escape jumping off the gravel or placing blocks.

### Ore tower













































For a fully automated version, replace the top TNT with an observer.
1. Make a tall watchtower.
2. At the top out of sight, put a bunch ofTNT.
3. Make averticalredstonepath to the TNT with aleverto activate it.
4. Put alureat the top, and ask someone to go get it. When they get to the top, pull the lever.



### Return home to a potion of instant damage II
Note: This trap needs to be built on an already existing ender pearl "stasis chamber" where a player throws an ender pearl in and it teleports them back if the chamber is turned off, or a player enters it

1: Throw in a lot of splash potions of various negative effects. Make sure they don't shatter.


2: Trigger the ender pearl, teleporting the player who threw it into the splash potions, which shatter, possibly killing them

## Other traps
The traps here do not yet fit into any of the other categories.

### Spike trap
























The spike trap.
Materials: a dispenser, a pressure plate and any type of arrows.

1. Dig a 1×1×1 hole.
2. Place a dispenser facing up in the hole and fill it with arrows.
3. Place a stone pressure plate on top of the dispenser.
4. If the target steps onto the pressure plate, they will get shot by an arrow.

This trap is not lethal, except to players or mobs with low health. It could be made to be more of an annoyance if you replace the arrows with tipped arrows with potions such as Slowness, Poison, Weakness, or even fire charge to inflict fire damage.

### Slow monologue trap
























The slow monologue trap.
Use shears to collect spider webs. Then dig a 3 block deep hole placing lava at the bottom and cobwebs on the top layer. Anyone not watching their step could get caught in the web and slowly fall to their death, allowing you to get a few dramatic words in as they die. (experienced players will be able to get out of this by mining the cobweb, and quickly placing a block in the lava)

### 
There is a way to 'store' fall damage in a minecart and later have someone take that damage even though they don't actually fall a distance that would make them take damage. You can also search up for a video on how to do this.

### Magma carpet trap
This trap will probably involve a trip to the Nether. After gathering a fair amount of magma blocks, make a room. Use the magma blocks you have gathered to make the floor of the room, and cover ALL the magma blocks with carpets. When the target walks on to the carpet, they will take damage from the hidden magma blocks, often wondering and unable to figure out where the damage is coming from. If they don't figure out the trap soon enough, they will eventually die or lose a lot of health from fire damage.

One alternative is to make the entrance to the Magma Room two iron doors with pressure plates on the outside but not on the inside, potentially trapping the target inside to burn.

This trap could also be a potential mob farm. When the mob is killed by the fire damage, you can enter the room, most likely by a secret entrance, and by sneaking or wearing Frost Walker boots, claim the mob loot and go back out without taking any damage at all.

Note: This trap will not work on all types of Nether mobs, as they are immune to all kinds of fire damage.

Note: This only works pre 1.16.

### Anvil trap
1. Place twoiron doorssideways withredstone torchesunder them so they stay shut.
2. Set up twopressure platesin front of the doors. The plates shouldn't do anything yet.
3. Runredstone dustfrom underneath the plates onto the roof of your porch to trigger twopistons.
4. Put ananvilon each extended piston arm, and make sure there is a hole through the porch roof down to the entrance where the target stands.

When the target stands on the pressure plates, the doors won't open and while they are confused the anvils will fall on them. They will either be killed or if the anvils don't fall from high enough they get injured. This trap is useful to stop thieves from stealing valuable goods, and exploits the fact that people don't look up.

### Command mine































Command mine.
Sick of rebuilding land mines that don't even kill the target? Replace the TNT with a command block with the command '/kill @e[distance=..3]' and the command block will instantly kill any entity that touches the trigger! If you use a repeating command block instead of an impulse command block and set "needs redstone" to "always active", you don't need a pressure plate. This trap may be of use only in Creative mode, though. (you can also use the /summon lightning_bolt command)
