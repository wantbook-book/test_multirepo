Complex curves, including saddle shapes and nested arches, may be seen in large modern buildings like the Sydney Opera House, many stadiums and skyscapers. Older buildings may have 'ogee roofs' − roofs whose profile follows an ogee curve.

These curves can be quite easy to do provided the building is sufficiently large that Minecraft's one-meter 'block resolution' is fine enough, but such structures tend to require a minimum building size of at least 20×20 blocks and often more. If you are working at this scale you will probably be using external computer programs or graphics tools to help with the design.

## Concave curves

Roofs with concave curves, as in the style of some traditional Japanese buildings made with bamboo are by far the hardest shapes to model well in Minecraft. At small scales − that is, at comparable sizes to NPC village buildings − it is probably best to approximate them using straight sections, possibly using fence posts, signs, or different materials to make the straight lines less obvious.
