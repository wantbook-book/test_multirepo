## Last note
Whatever you decide, this is your city. These are just suggestions. Be creative and do whatever you want with it. You can use all the suggestions on this page or you can ignore everything and build the best city Minecraft has ever seen! It's your call, so get building!

## After building a metropolis
After you've spent a long time building a city, you may think that is the biggest thing you can do in the Minecraft world, but this is not true. Minecraft has an infinite number of possibilities that you can do, that never run out. First of all, you can defeat all of the boss mobs in the Minecraft world, or complete all the advancements.

### 
If you have completed all the advancements, defeated all the boss mobs multiple times, have gathered several stacks of diamonds, and have made a city, consider modernizing your world. Here are some suggestions:

- Make roads and railways to every part of your world that you ever go to.
- Make multiple cities, with roads connecting them.
- Build yourself a giant mansion.
- Build every type of farm, and make as many as possible automatic.
- Build a giant bridge across a whole ocean.

Minecraft is a versatile world and you can never run out of the ideas of things to build, fight, and find. What you do in it is all up to you.

## Good city mods to use
If you are using Forge 1.12.2, you have access to thousands of mods. Other versions also support mods, but must use Forge or Fabric. Cities can look even better with mods, such as realistic signs, new products, new blocks, and even pilotable vehicles.
