### Self-building house
This is a house that will build itself perpetually. It will rebuild itself after creeper attacks if the redstone circuits and pistons aren't destroyed. It's a good idea to make the entrance come from underground because doors are hard to keep permanent.

Use an auto cobblestone generator (those above-ground ones that are piston-powered). Next, make a floating structure for your ceiling (the outermost block must be obsidian so you have an obsidian rim). Next, put upwards pistons on the ground under the obsidian rim. The cobblestone generator should push cobblestone onto the pistons. At the corners, you can either put a piston facing the next side, or another generator. On the area surrounding the wall, you will need a perpetual redstone circuit going to each piston. If the repeaters have the right delay, they should build your house.

### Skyscraper
Building up has several significant advantages: A skyscraper house can be seen from a long way away, provided it is tall enough. Of course, this can be a mixed blessing in multiplayer, the bad side being griefers can also see it easily. In singleplayer mode, it can serve as a spacious establishment. Besides countless rooms for storage, cobblestone generation (of course, if you do build something this big, you should have a lot of cobblestone), smelting, and such, it allows you to stack up farms in a small area so that all of them will be within chunk update range any time you're home. You can also use the roof, perhaps as a garden, or tree farm (a sufficiently large building can have the tree farm inside). You can also dig a quarry underneath your skyscraper to replenish iron, coal, etc.

It is important to ensure some practicalities are taken care of. For example, one must ensure the skyscraper's elevator allows the player to easily move between floors without taking up too much time—otherwise, it is probably best to just spread your base out horizontally. To do this, it is advised that you either install a water elevator, using soul sand and magma blocks to speed the player's ascent and descent, or a fast-acting piston elevator. Make sure a mechanism to stop the player at a floor of their choice is installed.

### Miniature Great Wall of China
Even more pointless than a skyscraper, but in multiplayer, it will be ridiculously hard for griefers to destroy it whole, and also ridiculously hard to recover after griefer or creeper attacks. Like in real life and for safety, build it in the mountains biome. First, make a 6×6 tower, then continue on the wall. Every 200 blocks, another tower must be built. You can even use the same technique used in the self-building/rebuilding house to make it even harder to fully destroy! Build until it covers nearly the entire biome if you wish!

### Huge Cruise Ship
Resources needed:

- About 10-200 thousand blocks of iron.
- Luxury blocks.
- A massive ocean biome (perhaps water world preset).
- Patience. It can take up to 100+ days to build.

- Description:
- The massive cruise ship is a time-consuming build, and you may use real ships to work off of also. Start with the hull, placing iron and then ahighly recommended stepis to hollow the hull! Then, start on the lower decks. Then, you will want to set up the upper floors, suites, restaurants, buffet, and any other touches you want. Also, consider adding obsidian between two iron layers for safety. In the staterooms, consider televisions, tables or beds, too!

Extras:

- A pool
- A spa, and shopping centers—they can be profitable too.
- A pier, which is also a great addition to a city.

## Add-ons
### 
These are often just normal on-ground homes with walls around them.

Description

These shelters offer far higher protection, and if there are no dark places on the walls or inside, then, you can roam freely at night without fear of mobs (as long as you are inside the walls), offer a place to attack from, and allows you to build at night.

Location

Large flat area

Materials

- A normal freestanding home.
- As many blocks as you need (cobblestoneis suggested) to at least build a 4 block high wall around your home (preferably higher) and a lip on the edge (optional, but recommended).

Construction

First pick a perimeter for the wall so you will have space to build in later on, then build a 1 block high wall there. After that, keep making it higher and higher until you have the desired height. Then, you will build a lip that is at least 1 block over on the top of the wall to prevent spiders and spider jockeys from climbing over.

Extras

- Towers can be included on the sides to make it look better and give a better point to attack from.
- A larger lip can be used to give a better point to attack from.
- Windows can be added to allow you to see outside.
- A ditch can be added to trapmobs, kill mobs withlava, or transport them to a lava pit (with improved mob AI, this is most likely impossible for the fact that mobs won't just walk into lava).
- Walls can be made thicker to resist explosions (not needed if the wall is made ofobsidianorbedrock).
- By building by the sea, part of the wall may not be needed.

### 
These are quite obvious additions if you are by the sea, and can be quite useful if you happen to have many bases and mines offshore.

Description

These are built next to water, by a natural sea or possibly a man-made channel, and allow the usage of boats to travel in and out of your base.

Location

Virtually anywhere there is water, most usefully if next to a sea.

Materials

- Water (If an artificial inlet is to be constructed)
- Any material, amount dependent on the size of the docks
- Slabs (for landing boats on without destroying them)
- Doors (Optional, but highly recommended to stop your boats from floating away)
- Chests (Optional, used to store materials for voyages and spare boats)

Construction

First, pick a suitable area on the sea or dig a trench you can sail through and flood it. Once you have a waterfront ready, build as many units for boats as you wish. These are generally 2×2 squares that can be dug into land or built into the water, and usually, have a double door at the front to stop boats from drifting out to sea. Place boats in each of these and make sure you can sail in and out easily. Place wool or stairs at the opposite side of the doors to stop high-speed boats from shattering when they hit the wall. Add storage, dispensers, or anything else you want.

Extras

A harbor with dispensers to place boats and doors to stop the boats from floating away.
- You can build a redstone wire connected to a music block to be alerted whenever something is coming.
- Dispensers can be built for boats instead of placing them in storage.
- Towers can also be built instead as a lookout post.
- Walls can be built on the sea with iron doors in the water to keep unwanted guests from getting into your harbor.
- You can have several different sets of docks in a concentrated area, with buildings for whatever purposes in-between, to build an entire large-scale base around the harbor.
