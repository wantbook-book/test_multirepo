#### Silverfish
Often, a mapmaker creates a passageway with walls of monster eggs. If you break one of these blocks, it spawns a silverfish, which, when attacked, spawns even more silverfish from adjacent blocks. A silverfish cannot call for help if it is killed in one shot by a player, or if it dies by "natural" causes.

A silverfish has 4 hearts of health. Here are some ways of killing a silverfish without it spawning more silverfish:

- Shooting it with a fully-chargedbow(4.5 hearts of damage)
- Using apotion of Harming II(6 hearts of damage)
- Hitting it with aSharpnessI enchanteddiamond sword(4~5 hearts of damage)
- Hitting it with aBane of ArthropodsII enchantedwood sword(4~5 hearts of damage)
- Setting it on fire with aflint and steel(natural causes)
- Burning it inlava(natural causes)
- Critical hits (4-7 hearts of damage)

#### Endermen
An easy way to defeat endermen is to stand in 1-block deep water 2 blocks from shore, and attack them repeatedly. This makes you safe against their attacks, and the water damages the endermen.

### Funboxes
Funboxes are a term commonly used in the Minecraft community, describing 27 spawners arranged in a 3×3×3 manner. It can be hard to defeat one of these without dying, because of the massive number of mobs that funboxes can spawn at once. Here are some strategies for disabling them:

#### Lava
Lava is the easiest and most effective way of disabling a funbox. It lights up the area around the funbox, disabling the spawners, and kills any monsters already spawned by the funbox.

To use lava, get within block-placing range of the funbox, and pour lava on it.

If the funbox is out of reach, you can alternatively bridge over to the funbox and pour lava from above.

#### Cannons
Using a TNT cannon can be a fun and fairly effective way to dispatch funboxes. However, TNT can do great damage to players and blocks, so be careful with this method so that you don't blow up a chest or die.

#### Tunneling
Tunneling is another method of disabling a funbox. The easiest way of tunneling toward a funbox is to go from below, as most funboxes are placed out in the open. Make sure to light up your tunnel well while you tunnel toward it, as if your tunnel is too dark, monsters may spawn.

#### After disabling
If the funbox is inside of a dungeon, it's best to break it, as creepers can destroy lighting around a funbox (and thereby reactivating it). You can additionally get experience if you mine the spawners. 

If the funbox is near your base, you can turn it into a fast mob grinder for drops or experience.

### Big rooms
Big rooms are dungeons that are located in a large room. The monster spawners are often spread out in big rooms to challenge the player extra, making it difficult to light the area up enough to prevent mob spawns.

#### Runthrough
Drink a potion of Swiftness and charge into the area, placing torches where you can. This is dangerous, but effective as well, because you can cover large areas, and therefore disable lots of spawners.

#### Charge and retreat
Go into the room, quickly light up as much as possible, and retreat back to a safe spot, before repeating. This method is effective, but it is slow and rather dangerous.

#### Tunneling
Dig tunnels under the floor so that there is one block between the tunnel and the room. Every once in a while, mine a block above you and place a light-emitting block in the room above, before quickly sealing the opening again. This disables most of the spawners makes the Charge and Retreat method much easier. Using lava as the light-emitting block is also effective, but dangerous.

Tunneling to the top of the dungeon and pouring lava from above is a much safer way of doing this.

### Landscapes
A landscape is an area on a map that is bigger than even a big room, containing several little dungeons for you to conquer. There are also usually areas on the other side of these landscapes, making these areas much more annoying.

#### Transportation
Using rails is a effective way of moving around the landscape. You could also make a tunnel under the landscape for safe travel at night, but this takes a lot of time, and is not as efficient.

### Void rooms
Void rooms are rooms that have areas which open up to the void or lava. If you fall off of the main platforms, you lose your inventory most of the time.

Go slow and steady in these areas. Don't take unnecessary risks. Block off any holes to the Void that you can reach, and be careful of sand or gravel.

#### Bridging
If there is a gap between two platforms, make a secure bridge. Place blocks to the left and right of you, in addition to below you. However, note that if auto-jump is enabled, the barriers on the left and right of you would have to be 2 blocks tall in order for them to be effective.

If there are too many mobs on the platform where you are heading, it is best to make a piston bridge, if possible. Place a piston facing the platform, and repeatedly have it push blocks. Do this three times: one for the floor, and two for the rails on both sides.

### Mazes
Mazes are found occasionally in maps. If the Adventure map is in Survival mode rather than Adventure, mazes are often made of bedrock, so that they can't be mined through.

#### Hug a wall
Before starting, choose one direction to go and stick with it, as this makes getting out easier later on. When you're at a split in the road, mark the way you entered, and then follow the path in the direction chosen above. If you hit a dead end, go back to the last split road, and mark that section correspondingly. Another way to find your way out of a maze is to walk alongside one side of the wall. It's a time-consuming method, but as long as there are no loops in the maze, you're bound to find your way out eventually.
