### Icy Dwelling
If you happen to be in that biome, you can make your house in an ice spike. The packed ice doesn't melt or produce water. Carve a small room and be sure to light up the entrance. And if you don't have a bed, take out the first block in the one block wide pillar. Mobs can't get through and you can tell the time.

### Trapdoor Ground Bed
This is a simple design where you break two blocks of ground and place a bed. Then, place two trapdoors above it. You can now open the trapdoors and sleep.

### Covered Ground Bed
This method of making a simple bed is as easy as it gets. All you need is a bed, 4 dirt, and optionally a trapdoor and a torch.

Dig a hole in the ground for a bed. Then, place the bed down. Next, place two dirt on top of the blocks next to the base of the bed. Fourthly, place a block of dirt directly on top of the pillow side of the bed. After that, you can place a final block of dirt 2 blocks above the base of the bed. Place the trapdoor on the block in front of the base of the bed. Then, close it before getting in bed. If you have a torch, you can place it above the base of the bed on any of the dirt blocks.

You can also alter this design, saving one block of dirt, by using the bottom log in a tree as what is normally the dirt block on top of the pillow side of the bed.

### Enterable Covered Ground Bed
This design is similar to the Covered Ground Bed, except that you can enter it and there is a layer of protection.

Dig a hole in the ground of the bed, like the Covered Ground Bed. Then, place the bed down. Next, place two dirt on top of the blocks next to the base of the bed. Fourthly, place a block of dirt directly on top of the pillow side of the bed. After that, you can place a slab 2 blocks above the base of the bed. Remove the dirt in front of the base of the bed and place a slab. You can now walk into your shelter for the night, and place a trapdoor on the block in front of the base of the bed above the cobblestone slab for protection. Close it so no mobs can get in. However, you have to destroy this trapdoor to get out. The section above the trapdoor when closed can be used for archery, or can be replaced with another trapdoor. If you have a torch, you can place it above the base of the bed on any of the dirt blocks.

## Inventory management
The biggest part of this experience is the traveling. You'll need to pick up all your gear every morning and leave your base for the night. Storing your goods in chests won't help you, but ender chests help with carrying extra resources. As long as you have a tool with Silk Touch, you can use and mine your ender chest without worry, but if it breaks make sure to get a replacement before you mine the ender chest without thinking and get only obsidian. Shulker boxes will also make a good storage setup, granted you can get your hands on a couple; however, bundles‌[upcoming] will provide a more accessible alternative, while also allowing multiple types of items to be carried in one stack.

You also need to pack in the most economic way possible. Try to only carry the base materials, that way you can hold more per stack. For instance, carrying wood instead of planks will allow you to hold four times as many materials. Carrying wood (logs) instead of sticks will allow you to hold eight times more! Only craft as many items as you need and carry the rest in raw materials. Also, try not to mix things like the different types of wood or planks, as that takes up space, too. Although it isn't as compact, you could craft the mixed wood into sticks, as they will match then. If you are using shulker boxes, it is advisable to use the different colors of shulker box for categorization.

Then you have to decide what is worth taking and what is easy to make more of later on. Is taking up a whole slot for your crafting table worth it, or is four planks easy enough to come by to build another? What else could you carry instead of that stack of wood? Another weapon or pickaxe?

Another good tip is to use the rare materials early. Using a couple of iron ingots to make a faster axe or pickaxe will save you a lot of time when chopping wood. That time is crucial when you're fighting the clock each day and night.

If you like inventory management but think a whole chest-full is too much space, you can add additional limits such as only holding items in your inventory bar (that you can access without pressing e) or setting off each day with only 9 items. Excess items could be incinerated, buried, placed, or otherwise discarded.

Another way to carry around a lot of items would be to have a donkey or llama. Put a chest on it and have him store the extra things while you use a lead to have them follow you around. Having an ender chest and a donkey or llama with chest (plus your own normal amount of storage slots) will give you the third most amount of storage, the second most being shulker boxes within a donkey or llama chest and the most being storing an ender chest full of shulker boxes. Be sure to store the ender chest in your own inventory (not in the animal’s chest) so that if something happens to them, you don't lose as many items.
