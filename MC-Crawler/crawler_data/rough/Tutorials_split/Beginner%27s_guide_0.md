# Tutorials/Beginner's guide
This starter guide provides advice for players who are beginning their Minecraft journey. This is a beginner's guide teaching you the basics to Survival Minecraft. 

Before reading further, it's expected that you have already bought and downloaded the game. You must create a new world before starting the tutorial. 

In survival, your character can die when you deplete your health (as indicated by the red heart icons). This does not mean the game ends, unless you are playing in Hardcore. Death occurs in Minecraft if you take enough damage and run out of hearts. Your equipment and inventory drop where you died and your character respawns elsewhere. Initially this is near where you started (the "world spawn"), but using a bed lets you set a preferred spawn point.  

Note: If you wish to keep your inventory on death go to Create New World. Go to the "More" tab. Select "Game Rules" and scroll until you see "Keep inventory after death" and select ON. 

If you have an existing world with cheats enabled or open to LAN. Press the "T" key to open chat. Type: /gamerule keepInventory true‌[Java Edition  only]

## Controls and interface
Main article: Controls
Minecraft is a sandbox game in which your character wanders around in a world, collecting resources and utilizing them to craft various items. To gain an advantage, you need to understand all the different techniques and abilities of the control system. If you are having trouble, you may want to start with a Peaceful Mode world to practice and, if necessary, change the keyboard bindings. The world in Minecraft is composed of blocks, mostly cubical and of various shapes, giving everything a blocky and pixelated appearance. These blocks not only represent objects in the game but also serve as a standard measure of distance, with each block being officially defined as a one-meter cube. Your character can occupy a single block's space and stands a little less than two blocks tall.

Time passes within this world, and a game day lasts for 20 real-world minutes. Nighttime is much more dangerous than daytime: the game starts at dawn, and you have 10 minutes of game time before nightfall. The primary purpose of this guide is to help you "find your feet," acquire basic equipment, and build shelter before nightfall. Hostile or neutral mobs spawn when night falls, and most of these mobs are dangerous, trying to attack you. It's essential to craft a bed so that you can sleep through the night and quickly transition from nighttime to daytime.

This article mostly assumes you are playing on Java Edition or desktop versions of Bedrock Edition, where you use your keyboard and mouse to interact with the game. The Controls page gives you a complete overview of all the controls and every control that does a action, or shows up a certain GUI.

This and other articles generally refer to controls by their default bindings. Most of the controls can be changed in the game's options menu, by clicking on the one you want to change, and then pressing the key you want to use for that control. If you are already using that key for something else, then it turns red.

When you start the game for the first time, a short in-game tutorial appears to explain the basics of how to move and look around in the corner of the screen.‌[Java Edition  only]

When moving around the world and dealing with blocks and creatures in the world, there are four basic operations, each discussed below:

- Movement in four directions, as well as looking upward and downward, jumping, and sneaking. Variations include sprinting and swimming.
- As you move around, you occasionally see or produce items floating "loose" in the world. Interacting withthoseis simple: when you move close enough to them, they fly toward you and you automatically take them into your inventory (unless your inventory is full, see below). At the start of a game, just pick up every loose item you encounter. You may eventually find uses for them, and it takes a little while to fill up your inventory. You can also drop ("throw") items back into the world.
- "Mining" or breaking blocks, which is the usual way to collect resources from the landscape. As long as you use the right tools, a broken block usually drops one or more items. Attacking mobile creatures ("mobs") uses the same controls as breaking blocks, and they also usually drop items when killed. In general, attacking requires brief taps of the relevant control, while breaking blocks requires holding down the same control. Some blocks, such asshort grass, break instantly.
- "Using" items or blocks. This is more complex, since it can apply to blocks in the world or to tools in your hand. The same controls are used for some interactions with creatures (such as shearing sheep or trading with villagers), but this is a matter for later days in the game.
- Your character can also work with items in a GUI, especially managing your owninventory, crafting new items, and working with storage items such as chests. This uses the mouse and sometimes the keyboard differently, while you are focused on your inventory and/or a crafting task rather than the world around you.
