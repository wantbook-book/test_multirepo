## Armor
Unbreaking is not as necessary on armor as on tools and weapons. Unbreaking III on a piece of armor only makes it last about 43% longer, but for a tool or a weapon, its durability is effectively quadrupled.  

### Helmet
- Mending
- ProtectionIV orProjectile ProtectionIV orBlast ProtectionIV orFire ProtectionIV
- UnbreakingIII
- RespirationIII
- Aqua Affinity
- ThornsIII
	- Optional
	- Consumes extradurability
	- May be inconvenient for mob transport as mobs may die to the effect.

There are multiple enchantment orders with the same cost in levels. At the same total costs in levels the cost in XP can still be different. For example two steps costing 2 and 4 levels require more XP than two steps costing 3 levels each. The optimal enchantment order with Thorns III is {[(Helmet + Thorns III)@12 + (Respiration III + Unbreaking III)@3]@11 + [(Protection IV + Mending)@2 + Aqua Affinity]@3}@14 with a cost of 12 + 3 + 11 + 2 + 3 + 14 = 45 levels. The optimal enchantment order without Thorns III is {[(Helmet + Respiration III)@6 + (Protection IV + Mending)@2]@8 + (Unbreaking III + Aqua Affinity)@2}@9 with a cost of 6 + 2 + 8 + 2 + 9 = 27 levels.

### Chestplate
- Mending
- ProtectionIVorProjectile ProtectionIVorBlast ProtectionIVorFire ProtectionIV
- UnbreakingIII
- ThornsIII
	- Optional
	- Consumes extradurability
	- May be inconvenient for mob transport as mobs may die to the effect.

The optimal enchantment order with Thorns III is {[(Chestplate + Thorns III)@12 + (Unbreaking III + Mending)@2]@7 + Protection IV}@7 with a cost of 12 + 2 + 7 + 7 = 28 levels. The optimal enchantment order without Thorns III is [(Chestplate + Protection IV)@4 + (Unbreaking III + Mending)@2]@7 with a cost of 4 + 2 + 7 = 13 levels.

### Leggings
- Mending
- ProtectionIVorProjectile ProtectionIVorBlast ProtectionIVorFire ProtectionIV
- UnbreakingIII
- ThornsIII
	- Optional
	- Consumes extradurability
	- May be inconvenient for mob transport as mobs may die to the effect.
- Swift SneakIII

The optimal enchantment order with Thorns III is {[(Leggings + Swift Sneak III)@12 + (Thorns III + Mending)@2]@16 + (Protection IV + Unbreaking III)@3}@11 with a cost of 12 + 2 + 16 + 3 + 11 = 44 levels. The optimal enchantment order without Thorns III is {[(Leggings + Swift Sneak III)@12 + (Unbreaking III + Mending)@2]@7 + Protection IV}@7 with a cost of 12 + 2 + 7 + 7 = 28 levels.

### Boots
- Mending
- ProtectionIVorProjectile ProtectionIVorBlast ProtectionIVorFire ProtectionIV
- Feather FallingIV
- UnbreakingIII
- Depth StriderIIIorFrost WalkerII

	- Consumes extradurability
- ThornsIII
	- Optional
	- Consumes extradurability
	- May be inconvenient for mob transport as mobs may die to the effect.

There are multiple enchantment orders with the same cost in levels. At the same total costs in levels the cost in XP can still be different. For example two steps costing 2 and 4 levels require more XP than two steps costing 3 levels each. The optimal enchantment order with Thorns III is {[[(Boots + Soul Speed III)@12 + (Thorns III + Mending)@2]@16 + (Depth Strider III + Feather Falling IV)@4]@14 + (Protection IV + Unbreaking III)@3}@15 with a cost of 12 + 2 + 16 + 4 + 14 + 3 + 15 = 66 levels. The optimal enchantment order without Thorns III is {[(Boots + Depth Strider III)@6 + (Protection IV + Unbreaking III)@3]@9 + (Feather Falling IV + Mending)@2}@10 with a cost of 6 + 3 + 2 + 9 + 10 = 30 levels.

#### Feather Falling
When obtaining Feather Falling from an enchanting table, the player should not enchant at level 30, but reduce to levels 22, 24 or 26. At level 30, there is only about a 3% chance to obtain Feather Falling on a pair of diamond boots; but using level 24 and 26, the chance is a much-higher 30%; at level 22, the chance is as high as 44%. The enchantment level can be reduced by placing torches or most other blocks between the enchanting table and bookshelves, preventing the enchanting table from detecting the bookshelves.

## Weapons

The optimal enchantment orders is {[(Sword + Looting III)@6 + (Sweeping Edge III + Unbreaking III)@3]@11 + (Sharpness V + Knockback II)@2}@11 + (Fire Aspect II + Mending)@2>@14 with a cost of 6 + 3 + 11 + 2 + 11 + 2 + 14 = 49 levels.
