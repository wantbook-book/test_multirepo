## Little Sniffs
Feed a Snifflet

Requirements: Feed a snifflet (baby sniffer) with torchflower seeds.

You need to obtain torchflower seeds and feed them to any baby sniffer: use the torchflower seeds on a baby sniffer to feed it. If you don't have sniffers yet, you have to get at least two sniffer eggs (see Smells Interesting above). Prepare yourself for a lot of waiting, as process described below takes around an hour.

Place down one of the eggsâ€”preferably on a moss block, since it takes half the time to hatch on moss. The hatching area should be surrounded with a fence, and inside of it there should be some dirt or grass blocks for the sniffer to dig. After 20 minutes (10 minutes on moss), a baby sniffer will hatch. Now you need for it to grow up: this takes 40 minutes. The process can be sped up only with torchflower seeds, but since this is your first sniffer, you don't have those yet, so you have to wait.

About 10 minutes before the sniffer grows up (30 minutes after it hatched) you can place a second egg down, preferably on a moss block as well. 10 minutes later your first sniffer will become an adult, and the second sniffer will hatch. Adult sniffer will start to dig in the ground: it has a 50% chance to dig up torchflower seeds and 50% to dig up pitcher pods, which do not work for this advancement. After digging, the sniffer has an 8-minute cooldown before it can dig again, so during 40-minute timer of the second sniffer growing up, you should have at least 4 diggings performed by the first one. Statistically, at least one of those should result in torchflower seeds, which you can then feed to the snifflet. This will grant you the advancement.

If you were very unlucky and the second sniffer grew up before you got any torchflower seeds, you don't need to brush any suspicious blocks again for the next sniffer egg: simply breed two sniffers you got and they will drop you another egg.

This is a hidden advancement, meaning that it can only be viewed when the player has completed the advancement.

## A Balanced Diet
Eat everything that is edible, even if it's not good for you

Requirements: Eat every food item that can be eaten.

Eat everything that can be eaten in the game, excluding cake. Drinks, like milk and potions, are also excluded.

There are 40 food items in total that you need to eat for this advancement. Here is a list of them, with an easiest (but not the only) method to obtain the item:

- Cooked porkchop, cooked chicken and rabbit stew can be bought fromButchervillagers;
- Most items, including golden apples, golden carrots, glow berries, poisonous potatoes, pumpkin pies and sweet berries can be found in various loot chests;
- Mushroom stew and suspicious stew can be obtained byusingan emptybowlson red and brownmooshrooms, respectively. Brown mooshroom must be fed aflowerfirst.

The player can check their progress on this advancement in 3 ways:

- The easiest way is to go to the advancement tab and check the progress bar for this advancement. It showshow manyof the 40 foods have been eaten before, but notwhichfoods.
- A more detailed but tedious way is to go to the "Items" section instatistics, and check the "Used" column (the 4th column from the left). All items that has been used (including eaten) at least once has a value greater than 1. This way, the player knows which items have been eaten, but since all items are sorted on the same chart, the player needs to filter out food items from non-food items (e.g. bow), which can take some effort.
- The most reliable way requires access to the world files. The exact procedure is described in the"Adventuring Time"section, which also applies to this advancement; the only difference is that the entry to look for isminecraft:husbandry/balanced_diet.

Eating all 40 foods grants the advancement. Completing it will reward the player 100 experience.
