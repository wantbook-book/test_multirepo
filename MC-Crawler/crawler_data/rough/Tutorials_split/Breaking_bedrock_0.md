# Tutorials/Breaking bedrock
Bedrock is a block that is not intended to be broken in Survival mode. Despite this, it is still possible to break the unbreakable blocks in Survival mode without cheats. Bug exploits are used to achieve this, so these methods could be rendered useless in any update. Breaking bedrock is also more difficult than phasing through it, both of which are covered in this article.

Note that these methods can also be used to break other unbreakable blocks (though bedrock is the most useful) and regular breakable blocks (the player will not be able to collect any of the blocks broken, and they are much easier to break using tools).

## 
It may seem pointless to go through the effort of going through or breaking bedrock, but it is actually quite useful. Many players use this mechanism to travel large distances across the Nether. The most common use of these techniques is to make an easy access point to the top half of the Nether by phasing through the top layer of bedrock and then breaking the bedrock to put up a ladder or elevator to the top. Breaking bedrock is also useful if the player wants to fall into the void in the Overworld or Nether. It is also useful for breaking some of the blocks on the end gateways and the exit portal in the End. These same techniques can also be used to break the frames around the end portal in a stronghold.

## Phasing through bedrock
This section is about going through the bedrock. The only logical reason to do this instead of breaking the bedrock is going up through the bedrock in the Nether ceiling. It is recommended to bring the materials to build and light a Nether Portal with you to get back safely, as most of these methods cannot be reversed. 

In Bedrock Edition, the Nether build limit is 128 and above bedrock, so it is not recommended to phase through the bedrock. However, if you have already broken bedrock somewhere else, you can phase through the bedrock to return to a destination more easily.

### Method 1
This method works by placing a boat just below the nether ceiling and jumping out. This video shows how to do it and more information is in the description.

### Method 2
To use this method, you will need the following materials:

- Someender pearls.

The optimal strategy involves only one ender pearl if done correctly, though more may be brought just in case. Find a two block tall space to stand in just under the topmost block of the Nether, and make sure there is a two block wide (or one block wide, though it will be more difficult), one block tall space in front of your eyes. Throw your pearl horizontally into this space and jump. Prior to jumping, you should be suffocating in the bedrock. It is very easy if you look at the left/right edge of the surface you are facing and hold forward when jumping(only requires a one block  spaced crawl).

Pros:

- It is easy to get all the materials needed.
- It is easy to do once you get the hang of it.

Cons:

- It may take many stacks ofender pearlsto work.
- There is a possibility ofdeathdue todamagefrom ender pearls.

You will need an axe too.

### Method 2b
[Bug Used: MC-2164]

This method requires ender pearls. It was much easier to do in update 1.8, but is still possible in later versions.

Dig up to where the player would be "bumping" its head on the top layer of bedrock (on y = 127). Then, look straight up and throw the ender pearls as quickly as you can. This is more difficult to do in versions 1.9 and above due to the item cool-down. It works by having one of the ender pearls glitch and teleport the player into the block such that when the next ender pearl is thrown, it goes above the block and teleports the player to the top of the block.

Pros:

- It is easy to get all the materials needed.
- It is easy to do once you get the hang of it.

Cons:

- It may take many stacks ofender pearlsto work.
- There is a possibility ofdeathdue todamagefrom ender pearls.

### Method 3
This method is by far the easiest among all of them.

This variation uses the same resources and:

- 1stair
- 1ender pearl

Dig up to bedrock with Y at least 126. Place the stair towards the side just under the bedrock, then throw the ender pearl above it and you will be teleported to the top of the stair. Just jump and you can go out.

Pros:

- If the bedrock is at Y=127, only fall damage is taken, not suffocation damage.
- It is easy to accomplish.
- It is easy to get all the materials needed.
- You do not need to react quickly.

### Outdated
#### Method 4
An easy and cheap method that doesn't make the player take damage.
You'll need:

- 10-14 or more obsidian, depending on the size of the portal.
- AFlint and steel.

Creates a nether portal in the y axis=130 or higher. It'll create a nether portal above the bedrock layer.

Pros:

- You'll not be damaged in this method.
- No bugs or glitches needed for this method.
- You do not need to react quickly.
- A very cheap method, only need obsidian (or some buckets of lava and water) and a flint and steel.
- It's very easy to get back, as you only need to get in the nether portal and return to the Overworld.

Cons:

- This could affect the redirection of the nether portals near it.
