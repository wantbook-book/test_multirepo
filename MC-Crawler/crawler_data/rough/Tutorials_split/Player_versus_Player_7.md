### Advanced Techniques:
These are some more complicated and high level techniques. Many of them build off of other techniques and are more useful against better players, used to counter other more basic techniques.

- Falling Sprinthit: You can perform this easily by sprint jumping at your enemy and intentionally not letting go of sprint when you hit them, causing you to KB hit them while falling. If your opponent plans to Pcrit or even Crit Deflect you, they will be KB hit away to their surprise, giving you a free hit.

- Spam Clicking: Spam clicking at your enemy with a KB1 sword hits your enemy away, even by small amounts, without having to wait for your attack timer to come back. It can be used against combos to push your enemy back or against Pcrits, to push them barely out of your reach.

Spam clicking can also be used to break your opponent's sprint if you are running around each other and make your opponent easy to hit. S tapping away after doing this makes them easy to combo.

- S-Hold Pcrit Deflect: A possible counter to No-KB crits. Pcrit the first attack while backing out, and crit deflect their second hit. This is very similar to a Double Crit. You will most likely come out even and escape a bad situation.

- Swight Gambit: Breaking someone's shield while they are falling, intentionally letting yourself get crit by an autohit. This allows you to pcrit them and get off more crits from the shield disable.

- Pcrit deflections: If you are both Pcritting eachother, hold W into them until the moment before they Pcrit you, then hold S to take more knockback. Crit deflect that Pcrit and back away, sending them far enough away to stop them from hitting you back or letting you combo hit them. Therefore you come out a hit ahead.

- Offensive Double Crit: Critting your opponent and then backing up, pcritting or falling sprint hitting their next attack and instantly backing away out of their next hit. After the initial crit, hold S until you touch the ground so that their pcrit or hit will deal higher KB, letting you back away from them. After that, if they haven't hit, hold W so that they can't land a crit deflect. Go for a crit after the technique is successful, since it's likely they swung at you and wasted the attack and can't retaliate.

- Crit Deflect Bait: If your opponent likes to crit deflect your crits often, predict this and do a normal crit but hold S just before they hit you, taking too much knockback for them to reach you and combo you for your next hit. You crit them and they dont crit you, so you come out ahead.

- Early Critting: When you and your opponent both jump to crit eachother, hit them as early as you can (only once you start falling though. We still want to get a crit). KB hit them as soon as you can afterward; if you crit them first you will also get the KB hit in first and they won't be able to hit back.

- Trade Pcrit: By jump resetting AND hitselecting during a trade of sprinthits, you can get close enough to your opponent to Pcrit them. Catches pretty much anyone off guard, but requires you both to push in and sometimes a little ping.
- Switching to a no-KB sword: In SMP, you're automatically given 2 swords, one enchanted with knockback 1 and the other has no knockback. The problem with only using a KB 1 sword is you can't crit chain effectively as they're knocked farther away from your reach, while a no-KB sword wouldn't allow you to combo your opponent. In this tactic, you would use your KB 1 sword to apply pressure and after the enemy tries to retreat, you would crit chain them with your no-KB sword.

Defensive techniques:

- Deivi Popping: When your effects (Strength and Speed) are about to expire, swap your offhand gapples with a totem and prepare your hotbar around 3 healing potions, a strength pot and a swiftness pot, after which you do a suicidal move, then pop most your pots after your totem has popped. This usually catches the enemy offguard, though this strategy only works best when you and your opponent have around the same HP.

## Using Shield
Your shield is one of the strongest items in the game. It lets your opponent take 0 damage and 0 knockback, and you can do the same. It's completely necessary in winning any exchange to understand how to use it. 

### Disabling Shields
Disabling your opponent's shield is a huge part of SMP kit, giving you a 5 second window where they aren't able to protect themselves effectively. To disable a shield, hotkey to your axe and spam click 2-3 times, then immediately swap back to sword. Later in this section are some special ways to disable your opponent's shield to give you an advantage. Don't wait to charge the attacks: axes are inefficient at dealing damage. You can attempt to disable either when you see them put up shield, which requires fast reactions and good hotkeying, or by predicting when they will shield. While fighting, try to watch their shield patterns and learn them so you can predict them in advance. In addition, most players will shield with the following patterns:

- After eating a gapple
- After trying to disable your shield
- Right as their shield comes back from being disabled, especially if they are down HP
- If they blocked your last hit
- Right after the first hit of an engagement
- To block a Critical Hit or to block a Combo Hit

Be careful when your shield gets disabled. Did you shield in a predictable pattern? They might have learned that pattern. Be careful before repeating it.

#### Following Up:
Once you disable their shield, you have a 5 second window where they cannot block any hits. To take advantage of this, you can use 2 different follow ups.

- CRIT FOLLOW UP: Try to crit them out, blocking KB hits with your shield to get close and crit them. They won't be able to block a single crit, so you deal massive damage very quickly. Consider using an ender pearl to pearl close to them, or using a cobweb/placing water on them to trap them. If you want to use a crit follow up, its okay to only click their shield once when you disable it. That way you won't hit them away from you if you successfully break shield.
- COMBO FOLLOW UP: Combo your opponent. Because they can't block predictably timed Combo Hits with their shield, they are easy to combo while their shield is down.
