### Armor
Armor is a must-have when exploring a mansion, because vindicators have one of the strongest direct attacks of any hostile mob, and vexes also have substantial melee damage. Iron armor should be worn at minimum, and Protection helps to reduce damage from evocation fangs that would otherwise completely bypass armor and shields.

### Food
Nutritious food, such as steak, cooked porkchops, and bread are absolutely necessary for healing after a fight. The food can also heal your hunger bar so you can sprint.

### Expendable blocks
Cobblestone and dirt are the go-to expendable block for building a protective cover to heal, towering or bridging your way across. Although dirt is much easier to gather, keep in mind that it’s not as tough and can be destroyed by a creeper explosion. However, if evocation fangs are coming your way, use dirt instead of cobblestone to build a barrier such that you can quickly mine and escape if the fangs pass through.

### Torches
A few stacks of torches provide better visibility in dark corners, and prevent common mobs such as zombies, skeletons etc. from spawning.

### Water bucket
Used to break your fall. Necessary for all missions, no matter the difficulty.

### Shield
A shield (or two for backup) is recommended for a mansion venture because it can be used to block melee attacks. Just be more careful when using a shield against vindicators, as their axe attacks can disable it.

### Explorer map
The main way to locate a woodland mansion without cheats. Woodland explorer maps can be obtained from cartographer villagers.

### Elytra
As mansions are typically thousands of blocks away, a pair of elytra combined with firework rockets will suffice for a speedier and more efficient journey to the mansion. Just make sure you’ve packed enough phantom membranes for repair, or enchanted the elytra with Unbreaking (and possibly Mending) for it to last longer.

### Healing items
Powerful illager attacks can bring you to a vulnerable state at times, so golden apples, healing potions and regeneration potions will come in handy for a swift healing cover. Enchanted golden apples can heal you more than regular ones, but since they are extremely rare, use them sparingly if you get your hands on some.

If you do obtain a totem of undying by killing an evoker, do place it in your left hand slot as soon as possible, as shields aren’t as useful against vindicators as their axes disable shields. 

### Helpful potions
Potions enhance your performance, which can be highly beneficial although not necessary. Strength potions can give you the edge in combat, while invisibility potions can allow you to sneak into loot rooms given that you’re unarmored. 

### 
These make transportation of loot much easier, as mansions are sometimes very far, often thousands of blocks apart. You should pack backup gear in the ender chest, which you can place at the mansion’s entrance along with a bed, such that if you die, you’ll be able to respawn at your ender chest and quickly ready yourself and rescue your items. Bring at least 6 shulker boxes and put them in your ender chest. Bring a silk touch pickaxe to pick up the ender chest. There is a lot of loot and most of the furniture can be dismantled for additional blocks. You will want a way to store them, and you don't want to clutter your inventory. Diamond hoes, chestplates, and totems of undying are non-stackable and can take up a lot of space in your inventory.

### Ender pearls
Ender pearls can be used for quick travel across mansion floors, or escaping from a crowd of illagers. On the journey, if your elytra breaks while you are flying, throw an ender pearl to the ground to break your fall.

### Bells

  

This tutorial is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


Bells are normally used in villages during raids, where they give the Glowing effect to raiders, making them easier to locate. This glowing effect doesn't just apply during a raid: it applies to all raid mobs, including vindicators and evokers, under all circumstances. Bringing a bell to the mansion can help you see these two dangerous mobs through walls at a distance of 32 blocks, so you can have a better idea of their exact locations, as well as to confirm whether an area is completely cleared of illagers or not.

### Name tags
Using the "Here's Johnny!" tactic, you can easily distract the vindicators and kill them easier. To do this you need an anvil or if you already have an anvil back at your base, name them "Johnny" (without quotes) before you go to the mansion.  

Once you got the name tags, find a vindicator with hostile mobs to the vindicator. Once that is complete, name the vindicator "Johnny" with one of your name tags it'll attack all non illager mobs in the area. The point of this is not to make the vindicator do your dirty work, but to distract it on another mob so you can kill it without it coming towards you. 

### Iron golems
You can bring a iron golem from a village or make your own, but it is suggested that you make the iron golem yourself as they won't retaliate if hit by you unlike the naturally spawned golem. It's also hard to move the iron golem across rivers and trees if you decide to steal one from a village, so it is ill-advised to do so as it could die along the way. 

Iron golems can assist you in battle against the illagers or distract them, and if the iron golem survives the battle, you can use iron ingots to repair it for another room. It is also advised the you make the iron golem before you enter combat as you will often die trying to make it in time. 

Use leads to move the iron golem around or lure mobs into the iron golem's sight so the iron golem will attack it.  Keep on repeating this process until you can't find any more illagers in the mansion. After that, you can loot the mansion, turn it into your base, or burn it down.
