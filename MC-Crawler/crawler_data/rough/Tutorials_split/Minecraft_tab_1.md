Protect yourself with a piece of iron armor

Requirements: Have any type of iron armor in your inventory.

Iron armor can be crafted like so:

| Name            | Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Iron Helmet     | Iron Ingot  |                 |
| Iron Chestplate | Iron Ingot  |                 |
| Iron Leggings   | Iron Ingot  |                 |
| Iron Boots      | Iron Ingot  |                 |

Iron armor can also spawn in chests in villages (armorer's house and blacksmiths), ancient cities, strongholds and end cities, and also on armor stands in taiga village outdoor armory. Zombies and skeletons (and their variants) have a small chance to drop iron armor when killed. It can also be bought from armorer villagers. Iron boots can also be obtained by bartering.

You will get the advancement when you put one of the pieces of armor in your inventory.

## Hot Stuff
Fill a bucket with lava

Requirements: Have a lava bucket in your inventory.

Empty buckets can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Iron Ingot  |                 |

Buckets can also be found in chests in savanna village houses, monster rooms, and woodland mansions. Water buckets can also be found in village fisherman's houses. Bucket of aquatic mobs can also bought from novice-level fisherman villagers and from wandering traders: you have to empty those first to use them.

Now, all you have to do is find lava and use your bucket to fill it up. Lava lakes can be found rarely on the surface in the Overworld, and sometimes underground above Y=0. They often light the surrounding grass and trees on fire, which makes them easy to spot from a distance, especially at night. However, lava is most common at Y=-55 and below, where it fills all of the caves in place of air. If you are in the Nether, getting lava should be very easy because it is found in the lava sea there. If you are high up in the Nether, getting down to the lava ocean could be quite difficult though. Lava can also generate as a spring block in both Overworld and the Nether, or spawn in village blacksmiths, ruined portals, nether fortresses, bastions, woodland mansions, strongholds and deltas.

Note that you have to use the bucket on the source of lava. Normally, if the lava you see is not flowing, you can use the bucket anywhere, because every block of lava is a source block; but if you see a stream of flowing lava, you have to trace the lava flow to its source, and use the bucket on it.

| Ingredients           | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Iron Ingot+<br/>Stick |                 |

## 
Deflect a projectile with a shield

Requirements: Block an incoming projectile using a shield.

Shield can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients               | Crafting recipe |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| AnyPlanks+<br/>Iron Ingot |                 |

Shields can be also bought from journeyman level armorer villagers. 

Then, you need to find a skeleton, a pillager, a stray, a shulker, a blaze, a drowned with a trident, another player to help you, or anything else that fires projectiles. Have the shield in either hand and hold use, then let the projectile shoot toward you. The shield should block it (except if an arrow was shot from a crossbow with Piercing), therefore rewarding you the advancement.

## 
Acquire diamonds

Requirements: Have a diamond in your inventory.

You can either find a diamond ore underground, or look in various loot chests to find diamonds directly. 

Diamond ores are very rare, but by either branch mining deep down in the world or exploring caves that go very low, you will eventually find one. Diamond ore generate below level 15, most commonly around Y = -58. Mine it with your iron pickaxe, and collect the dropped diamond.

Diamonds can also spawn in village (blacksmiths, toolsmith's houses), shipwrecks, desert temples, jungle pyramids, mineshafts, buried treasures and end cities. Blocks of diamond can also rarely generate in woodland mansions, which you can turn into 9 diamonds.

| Ingredients      | Crafting recipe |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Block of Diamond | 9               |

You can also use a brush to excavate diamonds out of some blocks of suspicious sand that spawns in desert temples.

Obtain a block of obsidian

Requirements: Have an obsidian block in your inventory.

You can either mine the obsidian block or find it in item form. To mine it, you first need a diamond pickaxe. It can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients        | Crafting recipe |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Diamond+<br/>Stick |                 |

Diamond pickaxes can also spawn in chests in bastions and end cities.

A bucket of water might also be needed: find a water source and use it with a bucket.

Next, you need to find a lava lake (you cannot use flowing lava, since it will become cobblestone), either deep in a cave, on the surface, or inside of any structure that have lava (see Hot Stuff above), and pour the bucket of water next to the lava. The water should flow onto the lava, turning it into obsidian. If you find any naturally occurring obsidian, that works as well. Mine the obsidian with your diamond pickaxe, and pick it up. Note that this won't work in the Nether, since water vaporizes there.

Obsidian as a block also generates in ruined portals, woodland mansions, ocean ruins, end spikes, obsidian platform, and end ships.

Obsidian in item form can be found in chests in village blacksmiths, ruined portals, nether fortresss and bastions. It can also be obtained by bartering.
