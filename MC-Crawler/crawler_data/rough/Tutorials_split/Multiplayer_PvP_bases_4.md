#### Getting Ready For the Rest of Forever
Time: 5 seconds to Infinte

At this point, you've gotten past the limits of this guide. Your adventure to be the top dog is up to you now. If you still don't know where to go, then some suggested steps are:

- Have a hidden mine on the ground to obtain your diamonds and iron.
- Make an experience farm, possibly in the End or find a spawner in your hidden mine.
- Sell the spare stuff you don't need instead of letting it clog up your storage space.
- Create a faction armory with at least 1 reserved set of armor and weapons for each member.
- Get resources from the Nether such as blaze rods or quartz.
- Recruit people into your faction to speed the process up as well as improve defensibility. You want your base to be manned as much as possible.
- Pick a side in whatever is the large conflict is to gain stronger allies and to have someone to fight.
- Expand your farms to become self-sufficient. If you want to get animals up there, try putting water in a waterfall. Lead the animals into it and they will swim up.
- Build a brewery and make a Nether wart farm, then sell potions to other players for money.

## III. The Massive Cave Base
For a video example of a massive cave base, check the embedded video below:




Keep in mind, this base was made on a server that has explosive damage and ender pearls disabled.

PROS

- Can be hard to locate.
- Easy access to ores and caverns.
- Can gain materials from digging out instead of losing materials from the building.

CONS

- Can be hard to find again if you don't have a sethome.
- Can be difficult to get back to the surface.
- Can also be easy to find if you're near a very large cave system (or even astronghold)
- Digging it out and get it running will take a very long time (and dozens of pickaxes)

#### Construction
The first thing to do is deciding where do you want to build your base. The best location would be an ocean, far away from the shore, but beware, as people can drop their render distances to glitch inside. Once you have located a good spot, create an airshaft and start digging down. You usually want to build the base at layers 10-20 so you can mine for diamonds easily. Get ready for LOTS of spare cobblestone, and you will eventually run into coal and iron, and if you're lucky, gold or even diamonds.


NOTE: Be sure to get as MUCH obsidian as possible, if you encase your base in obsidian, there is no need for an ocean. It is also in some ways better than an ocean due to the render distance glitch and hybrid cannons.

#### 
Once you are at a good depth, it's time to begin digging out the base. Don't start tunneling just yet! Dig out a square (4 blocks of height are recommended) big enough to contain all the basic rooms of the base (crafting room, enchanting room, forge, furnace room, storage room, and others). 25×25 should be more than enough, though you can expand it as you wish. Build walls and start decorating the basic rooms.

#### 
Once your main base is established, then you can begin tunneling and expanding. What will you make a tunnel to is your choice. It can be a wheat farm (same design for carrot and potato farms), a tree farm, a mob grinder, a mine or quarry, it's up to you. Just keep in mind that you'll need to claim everything that you expand into or else other players can get into your base.

#### 
This step is optional but recommended. It's a good idea to have a secret door that leads to a basement located at an even lower depth than your main base. There you can keep a secret storage room to stash your valuable resources in (be sure to leave some of your iron/gold/diamonds in the main base. If enemies break into your base and find no resources, they'll probably figure out there's a secret room), and also a library to store books containing information on enemies and their bases.

#### Getting Ready For the Rest of Forever
Time: ???

If all is done correctly, you'll have an underground fortress deep below, don't put it in the ocean, as people can use a low render distance to glitch into your base, instead, make a water wall, with hybrid defenses. Be sure to cover the air-shaft used to access the base, or disguise it to make it look natural, hiding the trapdoor. This can seem like paranoia but it's always good to have more stealth and safety. Your base will take a very long time to be found even if enemies are hunting you relentlessly.

At this point, you've gotten past the limits of this guide. Your adventure to be the top dog is up to you now. If you still don't know where to go, then some suggested steps are:

- Branch out your mine and hoard all that precious iron and diamond.
- Make an experience farm or grinder.
- Sell the spare stuff you don't need instead of letting it clog up your storage space.
- Create a faction armory with at least 1 reserved set of armor and weapons for each member.
- Get resources from the Nether such as blaze rods or quartz.
- Recruit people into your faction to speed the process up as well as improve defensibility
- Pick a side in whatever is the large conflict is to gain stronger allies and to have someone to fight.
- Expand your farms to become self-sufficient.

### How to secure your chests
The underground cave is the easiest to secure chests with. Probably the best way to protect your vault is doing the following:

1. Make many vaults- To steal your loot, they have to aim a TNT cannon to your chests (if you have it claimed). If you have many vaults it will take them a lot of TNT to get everything, and most players will give up. Make fake vaults with empty chests too.

2. Make the richest vault in the middle- Again, the only way to steal from chests is to TNT cannon them from afar. The furthest they have to build the cannon, the more TNT they will need, The less their chances to hit are.

3. Protect the vault with obsidian and water blocks- Some servers have a plugin that allows 3 TNTs to destroy an obsidian block. This means you need more defense. Water prevents TNT from damaging blocks, so a wall made of obsidian with water in front of it is very secure.

4. Anti-hybrid defenses- Even the secure base wall described above is crack-able. A cannon shooting both sand and TNT will allow the TNT to blow inside the sand block, and that causes damage. To counter that you can make upside down stairs, instead of a straight wall, with water going down all the way. That way the sand will fall down and the TNT will not blow.

5. Keep improving- No base is completely unable to be raided. Even the anti-hybrid quadra thick obsidian water lava base. If someone finds a way and raids you, evolve. Block this path they found. Keep doing that, and eventually, you will have an almost unable to be raided base. Keep in mind that the wither boss can penetrate all blocks EVEN obsidian and water (with blue skulls, and spawn and death explosion and dash attack in Bedrock Edition) making the only cheap defense regenerating cobblestone walls, but hybrid cannons can penetrate those, so it will be hard to wither proof your base.
