# Tutorials/Exploring caves
Caves or caverns are naturally-formed cavities in the Overworld and less prominently, the Nether. Most caves have tunnels branching off as catacombs and winding in all sorts of directions. They are often very deep and can go from the surface all the way to bedrock. Caves are not ravines but will often lead into them.  Because they mostly lack illumination, they will often have groups of hostile mobs like skeletons, zombies, spiders and etc.

One should never go into a cavern without a good supply of any lighting and weapons. Leave all valuables back in a safe place on the surface. However, if these valuables are from the cavern itself, make sure to have a chest to put them in.

Caves are huge and can have numerous intersecting tunnels, making them easy to get lost in. Getting lost in a cavern can be very dangerous, since getting lost in a cavern for too long may easily drain your hunger, saturation, weapon and armor durability, leaving you hungry and vulnerable to attacks, both of which could cause your death.

## Finding caverns
There are many ways to find caves.

** Exploring surface **
By exploring the surface of the map, there is a good chance that an exposed cave will be found. Surface aquifers may indicate the location of a potentially-expansive cave system, and azalea trees indicate a lush cave below.
** Digging **
Digging around might uncover caves, but it is not easy as the map is (very) large. Choosing a random location and digging a tunnel straight down will intersect a cave system roughly 40% the time, but is not recommended since mining straight down may cause the player to fall inlava, a deep underground cave, or a cave system full ofmobs. A diagonal tunnel (downward staircase) takes 3 times as long to dig, but is much safer and can be traversed both ways. Make sure to look out for dripping water or lava above you as it may hint at an aquifer or a lava lake.
** Listening **
By following the source ofambience, or the sound ofmobscoming from underground, there is a great chance to find a cave. It's also useful to follow sound of water and lava.
** Piston **
Dig down, place apistonand power it. Since pistons don't extend if there are 13+ blocks ahead of them, you can use pistons to find caves.
** The Nether **
Traveling tothe Nether, going down roughly 20 to 30 blocks, along by at least 16 blocks, and creating a newportalwill likely cause the newOverworldportal to spawn in a cave since a portal is spawned in the nearest suitable space for the portal.
** Cartograph **
Use3rd party software(such ascartograph) to make maps of caves. This can easily lead the player todungeonsor caves.
## Recommended materials
These are some of the recommended items the player should bring with themselves into caves.

- Weapons: Because of a cave's low light level, mobs such as zombies, spiders, skeletons, creepers, and possibly other aggressive mobs will spawn on the dark areas of the cave, making exploration dangerous. It is recommended the player bring weapons such as swords, axes, or bows to fight off said mobs.

- Armor: As said before, lots of mobs spawn in caverns because of the low light level. Iron or higher tier armor may be needed when exploring caves, so as to give the player better protection against mobs. Exploring without armor is very dangerous, as mobs can kill an unarmored player in just a few hits. Armor can also beenchantedto have Fire Protection (for lava and burning), Projectile Protection (for skeleton's arrows), Feather Falling (for falling damage), etc.

- Tools: Caves house a lot of ores and other types of rock. Due to this, it's always recommended to bring a pickaxe in order to get started with anything. A shovel is also helpful for digging gravel and dirt more quickly. Axes, along with their combat utility, are also useful for quickly tearing down mineshafts for fuel. Hoes and shears may also be useful for harvesting plants such asmoss blocksandglow lichen.
	- Offhand: ashieldorbowfor combat, alternatively atorchor somefood.

- Lighting: Caves can be and will be very dark, so be sure to bring along any source of illumination.  Rather than bringing many stacks of torches, bring wood and coal to craft them as needed. Stacks of sticks and coal would take twice as much inventory space if crafted into torches.
	- The deepslate layer is clean of any coal ore, so you'll have less reliable sources of light. You may have to consider working with the dimmer light levels of sources like glow lichen, redstone torches, and redstone ore. Producing charcoal is another thing to keep in mind.
	- Lush caves have glow berries, giving lighting and food at the same time, meaning you will have to bring a lot less torches. Note, however, that if you pick them for food, the light goes out, so you may want to put a torch there.

- Food: Cavern exploration may take quite a long time, draining your hunger. Also with mobs spawning, and the fact that you can get lost may further help drain your hunger. Bring fillingfoodsuch as cooked porkchop and cooked salmon if possible. Cakes can restore a lot of hunger, but will not fill hunger saturation and must be placed before eating.
	- Optionally, anygolden food, for instance, agolden apple, can give youstatus effectsthat can aid your survival, like regeneration and absorption.
	- Optionally, afishing rod, for fishing. Water can be found in caves, so it may not be much of a bother.  However, fishing underground can be slow (no open-sky or rain bonuses), so it may take a while to catch a fish, especially a fish thatis edible.
	- Optionally, abucket of milkcan help remove any status effects inflicted on you, especiallycave spiderpoison andwitches.
	- If the player runs out of food, and gets lost, they can userotten fleshfrom zombies as an alternative, or pick offglow berries.
		- Consuming rotten flesh may result in food poisoning through the form of thehungereffect.

- Log: Bringing in a stack of log will let players craft a variety of useful blocks in the field, without having to carry large numbers of all of them:  Torches are the most usual, but players can also make a crafting table and then make such blocks as chests, ladders, fences and gates.  Don't craft logs into planks or sticks until you need to; large quantities of either will take up more inventory slots than the original logs.
	- If you find yourself running out of logs, you can stock up by chopping off the log supports of mineshafts, or growingazalea trees.

- Others: other items and blocks can help players to aid survival and reach any exploration goals, like abedfor instance.

(Water) buckets: Empty buckets stack (while water or lava buckets don't), but the player will want to keep at least one bucket already filled with water. This is useful for turning lava into obsidian, allowing it to be safely walked on or mined. Note that there can still be lava below it though, and the water should keep flowing. This also useful for extinguishing themselves when on fire. Empty buckets can let the player move water or lava springs out of their way, or collect more water or lava for their own purposes. Water buckets can also function as a ladder, and are needed to capture mobs like the tropical fish and axolotl. Lava buckets are also useful for fighting mobs, especally  for slimes.

- Blocks: A few stacks of cheap blocks, for instance, dirt or cobblestone,sand,gravel, can help reach certain places of the caves.

- Compass: Sometimes when the player get completely lost, they can just simply dig up to the surface and use a compass to guide them home. It is only helpful if their house is near the world spawn or if the player has used the compass on alodestonenear their base.
