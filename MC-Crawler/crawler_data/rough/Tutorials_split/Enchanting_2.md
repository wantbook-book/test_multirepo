## Disenchanting
The only way to disenchant items is via the grindstone or by repairing the items via the crafting grid. Using the grindstone removes all enchantments (except for Curse of Binding and Curse of Vanishing) but gives some experience back based on the level of the enchantment(s) and their value.

## Summary of enchantments
See also: Enchanting/Levels

Each enchantment in the table below includes attributes that are possible for the player to acquire legitimately in Survival mode. Other combinations are possible in Creative mode or with cheats, mods, or third-party software.

- Max Level:Maximum levels for enchantments vary, but the game can comprehend up to 32-bit integer values (−231to 231−1). Exceeding this value results in an overflow, and eventually resets itself to 0.
- Primary Items:The items that can receive the enchantment legitimately in Survival mode by using an enchanting table. Items of any material can be enchanted (some more easily than others – seeEnchantment mechanics).
- Secondary Items:Items that, in Survival mode, cannot receive the enchantment from an enchanting table but can from an enchanted book with an anvil.
- Weight:Relative probability of the enchantment being offered.
