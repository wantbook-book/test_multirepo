## Semi-anarchy servers
This is a mix of both vanilla and anarchy servers. The players here are encouraged to fight and usually grief and loot bases but usage of hack clients, duping, x-ray and other rules that the server owners add are prohibited.

The best example of a semi-anarchy server is Lifesteal SMP hosted by ParrotX2. The server allows fighting, griefing and conquering territory but bans netherite tools except for shovels and pickaxes, totems of undying, end crystals, respawn anchors, strength II pots, x-ray, hack clients, etc. 

## Anarchy servers

These servers meet none of the above conditions.

These servers are brutal, with only a bare minimum of rules (which prohibit things like god mode hacks, in which a player is immortal, or activities that cause things like extreme server-side lag or intentional map corruption), and an unmoderated chat. These servers may even be prone to crashes caused by players or map corruption, and players with hacked clients are the norm, not the exception. Griefing is all but an inevitability for players who choose to build anything out in the open. 

These servers are not recommended for most players due to their unwelcoming and unforgiving nature, and many of their users are unwelcoming to new players and would probably spawnkill you. 

Some tips for anarchy servers are: 

- It is highly recommended to get aVPNin anarchy servers, to prevent the server owners to trace player'sIP address.  However, some servers block VPNs to avoid ban circumvention.
- It is advisable to disable chat through theChat Settings, as in most anarchy servers, chat behavior can be extremely rude and hostile, and offensive language and links to malware sites are common in the chat.
- Expect spawn to be an incredibly hostile environment due to spawn campers and deliberate destruction of all nearby resources vital for survival (especially food and wood), and the area is likely to be surrounded with multiple deathtraps explicitly designed to kill or confine players trying to escape spawn. For the most treacherous spawn areas, you may need to use a hacked client equipped with a pathfinding bot.  On old anarchy servers, this destroyed spawn can go for thousands of blocks.  It is even possible for spawn to be rigged in a way that it is impossible for new players to escape, like
	- If present, Nether portals can aid in putting a good distance between you and spawn. But beware of portals that have been booby-trapped by having the other side be blocked off. Generally, portals that are far away are less likely to be traps.
- You should definitely build your base as far away from spawn as possible (no fewer than 10,000 blocks away, though even this might not be sufficient on heavily populated servers), hide it, and use ender chests to prevent your items from being stolen when the base is griefed. Due to X-ray clients, your base may likely be griefed if it is near highly populated areas or if you fail to cover your tracks. Keep the base small and unknown, as larger bases are noticed far more easily and every person you share the base with is a person who might reveal it to griefers- or even grief it themselves. In the event of exposure, some players might even grief their own bases just to deny others the satisfaction of doing so.
	- It might be worth considering the possibility of taking up an entirely nomadic lifestyle, as the only way to truly avoid having a base griefed is not to have a permanent base at all.
	- Using dispensers can fool players using X-Ray or ray-tracing looking for chests.
- Expect duplicated items to be everywhere, and expect sets of perfect enchanted armor, weapons, totems and enchanted golden apples to go around for virtually nothing.  This can be an advantage to a new player, as a shulker box of high-tier equipment is really cheap.
- Only use trusted and reliable hacked clients, examples include Impact, Future, Meteor and Lamnda. Some servers may prefer forms of combat that are wildly different from standard Minecraft PvP- a common technique involves usingEnd Crystalexplosions to kill players quickly.
- Be wary about who you trust- there is a good chance that the person who says he wants to help you is trying to lead you into a trap. Similarly, when attempting to establish yourself within a community it is important to establish your trustworthiness. Players with a bad reputation are prone to being repeatedly griefed.
- Alliances can be risky to join due to frequent bouts of open warfare between alliances, but your chances of survival as part of a group are significantly better than they are if you're alone. Some groups do not readily accept new players into their ranks, and so you should work to build trust with their members and show them that you can be a productive part of their group.
- Never click suspicious links, especially in chat! These usually can lead to dangerous consequences.
- Never leak your coords, especially when you're planning to stay on the server.
- There are almost no Hardcore anarchy servers, but it is not recommended to join one if you find one unless it is really new, as you are likely to die as soon as you join by a spawn killer. Some hardcore anarchy servers (and most hardcore servers in general, anarchy or not) usually are not truly hardcore (vanilla's built in hardcore feature), instead, may temporarily ban players for dying.
