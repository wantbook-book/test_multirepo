# Tutorials/Superflat survival
Living on a superflat world can be a hard task, even for experienced players. Although using a normal superflat world is fine, the best preset is Overworld, because it creates water and lava holes and tall grass. Most of this guide does not work for Bedrock Edition because structures do not generate.

## Step 1 - Materials
Getting materials is fairly easy. Whenever starting a world, it is recommended that you start with a bonus chest to assist you in obtaining the materials necessary to thrive in the world, especially for players who decide not to select the Overworld preset. If decided to use the default preset, just follow step 2. It is however fairly common practice to get all neccesary materials the hard way, as it is often much more fun and you get know more mechanics you typically wouldn't use in the process!

## Step 2 - Pillage a village
As soon as you have spawned in the world, (make sure generate structures option is on) immediately look for a village. If you do find a village, run towards it as fast as you can. If you don't find a village, run straight in any direction until you see one. When you do arrive at a village, check all house chests for useful items. Although there can be a multitude of items found inside the chest, there are 6 buildings containing chests:

- Small house with double door, but without chimney
- Medium house, which looks like a conjoined house
- Big house (house with 4 beds, which looks like a 2-story house)
- Village tannery (building with cauldron which can be seen outside)
- Village cartographer house (building can be recognized from outside be looking at 2 flowerbeds outside with 2 block wide for each flowerbed)
- Village weaponsmith-shop (looks similar to a classic blacksmith shop)

### Abandoned villages
There is a small chance that a village may be an abandoned village, see this tutorial for more information about what to do in this situation.
With all other things aside, take:

- Food
- Armor
- Oak Saplings
- Iron Pickaxe
- Iron Sword
- Gold(both nuggets and ingots)
- Obsidian
- Diamonds
- Horse Armor
- Flowers
- books
- Iron Ingots
- Feathers
- Paper
- Empty Maps
- Compasses
- Saddles
- Emeralds
- Sticks

All of these items are useful in superflat survival. Take some wheat, beetroots, carrots and potatoes from the farms, and mine some logs from the houses. As soon as you have a few logs, make a single wooden pickaxe and mine some cobblestone and use it to create a stone pickaxe. Collect a stack of cobblestone and use it to create some stone tools (2+ axes, 1+ pickaxes, 3+ shovels and 2+ swords) however, you don't need to craft any sword or pickaxes if you find some in a blacksmith chest, as they are made out of iron. With these tools, continue to harvest some materials from the village. The materials you should harvest are:

- Wool
- Oak Planks
- Oak Log
- Stripped Oak Wood
- Stripped Oak Log
- Ladder
- Oak Leaves
- Bookshelf
- Oak Pressure Plate
- Mossy Cobblestone
- Cobblestone
- Chest
- Carpet
- Iron Bars
- Bricks
- Glass Pane
- Potted Dandelion(flower pot and dandelion)
- Smooth Stone
- Oak Fence
- Cobblestone Wall
- Torch
- Slabs
- Stairs
- Clay
- Terracotta
- Grass
- Hay Bale
- Wheat
- Potato
- Carrot
- Beetroot
- Flower
- Oak Fence Gate
- Oak Trapdoor

Note: Don't break 

- Oak doorsas it is easier for zombies to wipe out villagers
- Bedsas it causes the villager to lose their house which could potentially can make them wander out of village for searching unclaimed beds.
- Workstationsas villagers need to work at their workstation to resupply their trades, breaking workstation blocks have a chance to transform the villager's profession into unemployed, who cannot be traded with.
- Bellsas it is required for villager to gossip during mingle behavior for iron golem spawning.

Alternatively, you can use three iron to make a bucket, take two water from the well meeting point, animal pens, farms, stables, fisher cottages, or from small house with farm to make an infinite spring, and take one lava from the weaponsmith and use the water and lava to make a cobblestone generator.

Leave iron golems alone at this point, as you would probably not be able to defeat them yet. Check to see if villagers have reasonable trades, especially the armorer, toolsmith, and weaponsmith villager.
Also, be on the lookout for mineshafts because when they spawn in a Superflat, they generate at the surface (above ground). If the village doesn't spawn horses and you see any nearby, immediately corral them into animal pen, stable, butcher shop, or shepherd house. Search the village weaponsmith chest or tannery chest for a saddle. Tame a horse and saddle it to enable a very effective mode of transportation. Optional: in a weaponsmith chest you can find horse armor for your horse.

#### Wheat
Wheat can be one of your most valuable resources in Superflats. Apart from providing a stable food supply when made into bread, it can be used for breeding, and most importantly trading. Wheat is the best resource to trade with farmer villagers, as it is completely renewable, easy to acquire, and only 20 are needed to trade for an emerald, however not every farmer villager is able to trade for wheat. If the farmer village is not able to trade wheat for emeralds, break the composter until the trades are right, note that nearby unemployed villagers can also claim the composter. Through trading, you can acquire virtually anything you need. Wheat, therefore, makes items you trade with villagers renewable.
