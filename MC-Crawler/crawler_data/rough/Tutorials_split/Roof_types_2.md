### Monitor roof
A monitor is a raised structure running along the ridge of a double-pitched roof, with its own roof running parallel to the main roof. The long sides of monitors often contain louvers or clerestory windows to help light or ventilate the building. A monitor that runs the full length of the building is more commonly found on larger structures such as barns, warehouses and factories, and is rarely seen on domestic buildings. However, a monitor does not necessarily have to run the entire length of a roof.

- This sateri roof is a Swedish design; a hipped monitor roof.

### Helm roof
A helm roof.
A helm roof or Rhenish helm is a square roof with four gable ends. It is commonly used on towers. The building in this picture is 7×7 meters. To avoid gaps in the roof, slabs are usually needed under the main roof blocks. Here we use upper slabs made of quartz and lower slabs made of red brick. This design tends to work better with square towers of an odd width. Note also that the stair blocks should be placed to face in only two directions – North-South or East-West. Producing a good-looking helm roof with stair blocks facing in all four directions is very fiddly. For symmetry in both directions, it is usually simpler to just use ordinary blocks.


### Butterfly roof
A London roof, incorporating a section of butterfly roof at the back.
A butterfly roof is a dramatic V-shaped roof sometimes seen on modern buildings. The roof is usually extended beyond the edges of the building to provide additional shade.

This design was also used in some Georgian and early Victorian terraced houses, and it is quite a common design in central London. Note that for a London roof, this roof shape is placed at the back of the property, usually behind either a conventional gable roof or a facade. The central gutters tend to be prone to leaks. In this image the main roof has been made of red brick, and the borders with adjacent properties have been marked with dark wood.


## Other materials
### Green roof
Green roofs used to be more common millennia ago, although have been getting more interest in recent times due to their environmental benefits (such as stormwater mitigation, wildlife habitat provision, and urban heat-island reduction). The city of Seattle has some notable examples that could be worked into an urban Minecraft world.

Here are four variants of simple green roofs:

- One of the most basic green roof structures. House types like this function well for the first few nights a player is surviving.
- A roughly circular mound of dirt, hollowed out, and with a door and crude windows inserted. The windows are very deeply inset.
- A wooden frame, built and then buried; the windows and doorway are still quite deeply inset.
- A much neater design, similar to the church at Hof in Iceland.

### Thatched roof
A thatched roof using hay bales and yellow carpets.
Thatching is another ancient roofing style using materials such as straw, reeds, sedge, rushes or heather. While a thatched roof can incorporate most of the design styles used on this page, including dormers, the main roof is usually made of a single uninterrupted layer to avoid water leaking through. Roof variants such as cross-gabling or monitors are rarely seen on thatched buildings.

Where dormers are used on a thatched roof, they are almost always wall dormers, but one may also see the occasional deeply inset eyelid dormer, as in the picture.

When thatching a roof, it's important to angle the straw so that water flows off as quickly as possible. In Minecraft, a layer of yellow carpets may help with a roof's appearance.

Some thatching techniques simply layer new materials on top of the old as the older thatch wears out. Over the centuries, such roofs can reach thicknesses of over two meters.


## Dormers
A dormer is a structural element of a building that protrudes from the sloping plane of the roof. (C.f. monitor, which straddles a roof ridge.) Dormers create extra space in the roof by adding headroom, and they allow the addition of dormer windows. Dormers have their own 'mini-roofs' above them, and these can have almost as wide a variety of roof types on them as the buildings themselves, theoretically even including curved roofs.

### Wall dormer
A wall dormer.
For a wall dormer, the wall below the dormer is extended upwards and given its own roof section. Most types of dormers can be wall dormers.


### Blind dormer
An unsual type of dormer is the blind or false dormer. This is a dummy dormer that is only visible from the outside of the building, and is there to make it look grander, more balanced, or to add interest to an otherwise featureless roof. A blind dormer can look like any other dormer type.
