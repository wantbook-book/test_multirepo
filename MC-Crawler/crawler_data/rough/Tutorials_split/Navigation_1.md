#### Roads and Rails
To connect two locations, dig a two- or three-block wide trench between the two places. This trench can later be filled in to make a nice-looking path or road. Light the pathway to make night travel safer, and fences can be placed along the sides of the road to keep mobs away. To connect the road to more locations, create forks in the road with signs listing the directions to different places. A minecart rails could also be added to speed up travel.

### Maps
Main article: Tutorials/Mapping

Maps can be used to keep track of different locations in the world. Maps are not exactly centered on where they are activated, because they snap to a grid. They also start off with a very small scale, and need to be zoomed out to a reasonable scale after activation. Each zoom level takes 1 paper in a cartography table, and doubles the map scale and clears any current contents. The new map remains centered roughly where the previous map was activated. It takes 3 zooms to match the scale of the pre-1.4 maps; the fourth zoom reaches the maximum scale of one chunk per pixel. 

Colored banners can be used to mark locations on maps‌[Java Edition  only]. In Bedrock Edition, locations can be marked using large structures of colored wool or some other standout material. (You could also simply keep track of the coordinates of different locations on the map.)

Additionally, making a map room of the surrounding area gives you insight of the area around their base and shows points of interest, not to mention looking nice.

## Underground Navigation

Both natural caverns and artificial mines can be fairly disorienting without some kind of navigation or trail marking system. Here are some tips to avoid getting lost.

### Trail Markers
There are a variety of markers the player can leave behind to make trails, with a somewhat different selection being useful underground.

- Torches: Place all the torches on one side of the cave when entering a new passage. Follow the torches on the other side to find the exit. When the cavern forks, explore the left-most path first, then move to the right until the entire fork has been explored. Torches can also be placed to point back toward the exit.
- Signs: Placed at intersections and marked with ASCII arrows or messages can help keep track of exits, unexplored areas, and more. Signs are cheap, but they stack only to 16, which is why it's always a good idea to have a stack of logs and a crafting table on every mining trip.
- Cobblestone: Rarely occurs naturally, can be used to mark sections that have already been mined. Additionally, arrows made of cobblestone in the floor or walls of caverns can point toward the exit.
- Jack o'Lanterns: Can be placed at intersections with the face pointing toward the exit. This doubles as a light source and a direction out. In cases where there is one path on top of the other one, place the jack o'lantern higher (using piles of gravel or some other temporary block to place it on top of) to indicate the exit is the upper path.
- Netherrack: Conspicuous, easy to obtain, and rarely naturally appears in theOverworld. Netherrack can also be lit to create light and mark completed areas.
- MinecartRails: Can be used both to mark paths and to transport the player.
- Wool: Different colors can be used to signify different things, such as completed tunnels, unexplored areas, and exits.
- Redstone: Lines and arrows can be made from spare redstone dust, and placingredstone torchesnearby can make a lit trail that fades away. This can be used as a directional hint.
- String: Can be placed on the ground to leave a trail behind you.
- MagentaGlazed Terracotta: The arrows in the design can be used to point you in the right direction.
- Mushrooms: Can be found in caves and can be used to leave a trail.
- Quartz stairs: Can renamed and put on glowing item frames so when you move your crosshairs over the arrow you make from turning the stair, text can appear and lead you to where you want to go. : Note, this can only work on 1.17+ and these arrows can be seen in absolute darkness but don't actually give off light

### Other hints
- While it does not help in navigating the cave itself, it may be wise to bring a map into a large cave. That way, if you get lost and need to dig your way out, you can navigate back to familiar territory above ground.
- A good mining practice is to fully explore and light a cave system, or at least a whole tunnel, before beginning to mine out any resources. It is extremely dangerous to stop and mine in a dark cave system.
- As part of exploration, try to "clean up" the area, taking off leftover blocks, filling small pits, and generally smoothing things out. Inabandoned mineshafts, clear out most of the fence-and-plank "supports" as the player "claims" an area. This improves both visibility and mobility, cutting down on unpleasant surprises.
- Some water flows come from openings in the seafloor. It is possible to mark the entrance with ajack o'lantern, which are generally visible from the sea surface.
- If you get completely lost, dig your way out in a staircase fashion. Listen for sounds of lava and flowing water, and do not break blocks directly above you. If you must dig straight up, make sure to place a torch at your feet to break any sand or gravel that could fall on you. It can be useful to check the map to figure out where you would emerge (for example, you would probably want to avoid coming out underwater).
