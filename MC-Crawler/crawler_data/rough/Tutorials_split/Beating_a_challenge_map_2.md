#### Fighting in mazes
A common trick that map creators may do sometimes is to put spawners within the mazes, making it harder to move around. It's important to use corners to your advantage in combat. It's not recommended to use lava, as this makes it harder to penetrate further into the maze. Shields can be good in a 1-block wide situation. 

### What to watch out for
#### Sand and gravel
In general, a sand or gravel trap is a trap involving floating sand or gravel. When you place a block or a torch on it, it falls, likely revealing lava, a pit of monsters, the void, or fall onto a pressure plate connected to TNT.

Sand traps that expose areas are unavoidable; however, you can avoid the redstone-style sand trap by being wary. If you see a chest, furnace, or something of that sort, make sure you have a way of getting away before breaking it.

#### TNT
Map creators often create something in a map that looks like a reward, but in reality is a deadly trap. Always be on the lookout for something suspicious, as this could be TNT. Also, some maps take advantage of external tools or data values in commands, and make it so that TNT detonates when hit like it did in earlier Minecraft versions. This makes it impossible to destroy without detonating. In that case, you can pour water on it.

#### Pits
Although pits are easy to dodge within corridors, if you are distracted by something, such as combat, you may unconsciously fall into a pit. Always block off pits that may lead to deadly traps, if possible. Also, if you're fighting and you know that there are deadly pits nearby, make sure to move away from them.

#### Redstone-related items
It's important to be aware of buttons, levers, or pressure plates. Redstone circuits can be made to do virtually anything, so if you see an "innocent" pressure plate lying about, block it off, or avoid stepping on it.

#### Movement-affecting blocks
These include soul sand, ice, and vines. Soul sand makes you walk slower through an area, ice makes the ground slippery, and vines can be distracting when fighting against walls. Although these do not directly kill you, they can be a pain if you're trying to do something risky, such as fighting mobs. Therefore, try to stay away from soul sand or ice, and avoid being cornered by mobs in a vine-filled area.

## Preparations
### Your inventory
It's best to pack lightly when going into a dungeon, as you don't want to lose too many things if you die.

Here are some good things to have in your inventory:

- Twoswords
- Abow
	- Up to a stack ofarrows(or 1 arrow if the bow is enchanted with Infinity)
- Twopickaxes
- A stack or two oftorches
- Awater bucket(if there islavaaround the dungeon)
- Armor
- A stack or two of blocks
- Potions(if possible)

If rescuing another player from mobs in a dungeon, you should have:

- A sword and/or bow
- A pickaxe
- Some torches
- Some blocks
- Armor (should not be Diamond nor Netherite)
- Potions (if possible, and only in heavily mobbed areas)

Here are some good potions to bring along:

- Healing: Good to have on your hotbar, because it not only heals you, but if turned into a splash potion, it can also damage undead mobs, such as zombies.
- Regeneration: Great for runthroughs or spawner rushes, as any damage you receive are negated quickly while having the Regeneration effect.
- Fire Resistance: Fire Resistance makesblazesandghastsa lot easier to deal with.

### The base
Generally, most people build their bases around the Victory Monument, but some mapmakers have been annoyed with the monuments (e.g. dying zombies, growing vines), so it is best to build it relatively close, but not too close.

A base should be monster-safe, and contain basic necessities, such as crafting tables and chests. The following things are also good to have in your base:

#### Food farm
In most maps, the best renewable types of food are carrots and potatoes. They are easy to farm, and they feed a decent amount (Carrots heal 3 () and baked potatoes heal 5 ().) The following video is of an effective semi-automatic farm design, that is designed for wheat, but can easily work for carrots and potatoes.

If there are cows or mooshrooms in the map, then it is best to get a wheat farm started in addition to the carrots/potatoes. Cooked porkchops and steak heal 8 (), making it the best easily accessible food in the game.

A melon farm, unless it's big, is not recommended, as melons feed you only by 2 (), and melons grow rather slowly.

If there are chickens in the map and you spend a lot of time at the base, then a good idea would be an automatic chicken cooker, as that provides Cooked Chicken and Feathers automatically. Cooked Chicken heals 6 (), making automatic chicken a good food source.

#### Monster XP farm

You usually need only a monster trap in extreme cases, where it's impossible to continue the map without enchanting your gear.

The easiest way to make an XP farm is to set up a spawner trap around a funbox, preferably high up, so that the mobs are around 1/2 hearts when they fall, so that they can be killed in 1 hit.

#### Tree farm

Wood is undeniably the most important resource in Minecraft. In challenge maps, you often need plenty of it. A wood farm is useful.

#### Cobblestone farm

A cobblestone farm is necessary only when you need lots of stone or cobblestone. The following layout is an easy way to make a cobblestone farm:
