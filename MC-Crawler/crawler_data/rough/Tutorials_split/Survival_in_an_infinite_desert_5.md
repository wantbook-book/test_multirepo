### Mushrooms
If you can obtain even one mushroom and farm it carefully, you can slowly create a renewable crop. You can do this much more quickly if you use bone meal to create huge mushrooms. And if you obtain podzol from a wandering trader, you can even farm above ground, in sunlight.

However unless you are able to obtain a bowl, you cannot craft anything edible from the mushrooms, and their main usefulness is probably as a renewable source of fuel, not food.

Rarely a husk or a zombie drops a potato or carrot. This is beneficial if the player is about to starve; however, it is not useful long-term. You still lack a hoe with which to make farmland. The potato or carrot is good for only one meal, probably raw, but it's probably best to save it, in case you obtain a hoe or find farmland. However, hoes require material for the blade, such as wood planks, cobblestone, or iron, all of which are hard to acquire in a desert. Farmland can be found in villages, but these already have ample crops. A carrot might be more useful for enticing rabbits into a pen.

Spider eyes can be eaten, but the net effects are usually worse than not eating them. The poison does more damage than the food value is worth. They are only worth eating if you are already badly injured down to around half a heart (so the poison damage has little or no effect). Still, since you are unlikely ever to be brewing potions, you may as well stockpile spider eyes for the most desperate of food emergencies.

### Zombie cannibalism
The only other short term option for food is to kill zombies or husks that come to your house at night and eat the rotten flesh. Because of the risk of poisoning, only eat this flesh when you are safe inside your house. If you create any solid barrier you can stand safely behind the barrier and slowly kill a zombie by hitting it with your fist. Before the rotten flesh despawns, quickly remove your barrier (for example, cactus), dart out to collect the flesh, dart back in your house and replace the barrier.

The slightly good news is that, because your combat ability is weak, you're better off fighting only during daytime when there are fewer mobs around. Therefore, you would probably be eating rotten flesh from husks rather than zombies. In addition, you might also find some more rotten flesh from regular zombies that burned to death in the daylight.

### 
In a desert world without any structures (villages for farmland and crafting tables, or other structures just for planks), your sustainable food chain is ultimately based on eating the undead (either directly, or via the skeleton to bonemeal to flower-growing to rabbit-breeding chain, see above). Alternatively, you can just keep moving, like a nomad, and feed on the non-renewable rabbits.

In this situation, it's advisable to reserve the raw rabbit for eating during combat and use the (probably more plentiful) rotten flesh whenever you are somewhere secure, e.g. your base.

### 
Due to the problems obtaining cobblestone, you are unlikely to have a furnace with which to cook your food. However, even if you do obtain a furnace (e.g. from a village or by blasting cobblestone with a creeper explosion), you still probably won't want to cook your food. Unless you are farming mushrooms, the reason being that wooden fuel is much too precious and limited in supply in the desert biome to waste it on cooking food. (See Fuel below).

### Village farms
Food becomes much easier when you locate a village with a farm. At that point, you can finally move beyond bare subsistence and survival. Given that you still can't afford the fuel to cook your food, the best food item to farm yourself may be carrots. On the other hand, if there is a crafting table in the village you can craft wheat into bread, or if there is a Novice Farmer you can trade 20 wheat for 6 bread—nearly as effective as making your own. 

Always replant after harvesting. Be careful not to destroy farmland. Because it is difficult to obtain a hoe, you are unable to create or recreate farmland. Without farmland, you can't grow crops. Every block of farmland is precious. Be sure to use, or create, paths (or water) adjacent to every farmland block, so you never have to step on farmland. Every time you step on farmland you risk irreversibly destroying it. Farmland is not only useful for food for yourself. It is essential for keeping villagers happy and encouraging them to breed. This is critical because you need as many villagers as possible, of as many types as possible, in order to progress by trading. 

Chests in village houses can supply bread to eat, wheat for various purposes, and other useful items. Village houses contain beds so that you can reset your spawn point and pass the night in safety—probably moving the bed out of the village first.

As of Village & Pillage, desert village farm can also grow melon stem, which can be useful for melons as food, as villagers are unable to harvest and replant melons, but melon stem can grow infinitely. Cats and even farm animals also spawn in desert villages. Farm animals in village pens usually only spawn in pairs, so be sure to always breed more animals than you slaughter.

### Fishing
As sticks can be collected from dead bushes and string is dropped by spiders, you could use a village crafting table to craft a fishing rod, giving you a sustainable food source (using water from wells or river biomes and repairing or replacing rods with anvils/grindstones/crafting tables). However, this is likely unnecessary as village farms provide better food anyway.
