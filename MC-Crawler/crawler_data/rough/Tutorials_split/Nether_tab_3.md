 Take a Strider for a loooong ride on a lava lake in the Overworld

Requirements: While riding a strider, travel 50 blocks on lava in the Overworld.

First, bring a strider to the Overworld. You can get the strider to follow you into a nether portal by holding a warped fungus, or ride it into a nether portal and then dismount it. The strider will be transported to the Overworld. Make sure that:

1) chunks on the Overworld side were loaded before (similarly to the Uneasy Alliance advancement),

2) there is no water or rain on the Overworld side, as the strider takes damage from them.

After the strider is in the Overworld, you need to ride it continuously on lava until you're 50 blocks from where you started. This can either be a big enough natural lava reservoir, or a 50+ blocks long track of lava source blocks you made yourself. It is recommended that in any of these cases, you should be underground or at least in a dry biome ("Precipitation" parameter should be FALSE), because rain can kill striders very quickly, even mid-way through the ride. Also, because this advancement only accounts for horizontal displacement, going in a circle for more than 50 blocks doesn't count. If the strider walks off track, progress is reset, and you have to start from the beginning.

Once you're horizontally 50 blocks away from where you mounted the strider, you are granted the advancement.

## Hot Tourist Destinations
Explore all Nether biomes

Requirements: Find every biome in the Nether.

This is achieved by setting foot in all five biomes in the Nether: basalt deltas, crimson forest, nether wastes, soul sand valley, and warped forest.

If you go to the advancement tab, you can see a progress bar, showing how many of the five biomes you have visited. However, it does not show which of the five biomes have been visited. A way to check which biomes a player has visited is introduced in the "Adventuring Time" section, which also applies to this advancement; the only difference is that the entry to look for is minecraft:nether/explore_nether.

Once you have entered all of these biomes, you will be granted the advancement. Completing it will reward the player 500 experience.

## Withering Heights
Summon the Wither

Requirements: Be in a 101×101×104 (approximate) range from a wither when the wither explodes.

To summon the wither, place 4 blocks of soul sand or soul soil in a T shape, in any direction, and place 3 wither skeleton skulls on the line of 3 soul sand/soul soil. Two blocks under the "arms" must be air blocks.

The wither will immediately spawn, but cannot deal any damage nor be done any harm for 10 seconds, until it explodes. The explosion is very violent, so you should probably back away. At this point, as long as you're within a 100.9×100.9×103.5 area, you will get the advancement. 

It is not recommended to summon the wither without preparation. For more information on the wither, what to expect, what to prepare, and how to fight it, see the pages "Wither" and "Tutorials/Defeating the wither".

## Local Brewery
Brew a potion

Requirements: Retrieve an item from a brewing stand's potion slot.

You need a glass bottle and a brewing stand:

| Ingredients                        | Crafting recipe |
|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Blaze Rod+<br/>Anystone-tier block |                 |

Brewing stands can also be found in villages (in churches), igloos and end ships.

In the inside of a brewing stand, there are three slots on the bottom with the outline of a glass bottle, and another slot on top, which is for the actual potion ingredient. There is also a slot in the top left with the outline of blaze powder.

Brewing a potion is not actually required to complete the advancement.[1] The simplest way to complete it is to put any glass bottle (even an empty one) into any of the bottom three slots of the brewing stand interface and then remove it to get the advancement. No blaze powder or potion ingredients are needed.

## Bring Home the Beacon
Construct and place a beacon

Requirements: Be in a 20×20×14 range when a beacon is activated.

First, you need to craft the beacon, which requires a nether star, dropped by the wither upon death.

| Ingredients                          | Crafting recipe |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Glass+<br/>Nether Star+<br/>Obsidian |                 |

However, if you place a beacon by itself on the ground, it will not do anything. To activate it, you need a pyramid of certain blocks, which include blocks of iron, gold, diamond, emerald, and/or netherite. When activated, beacons can give you special powers if you are a certain number of blocks from the beacon. Minimum requirement for this advancement is a 3×3 square of mineral blocks. Place a beacon on top of the central block. This will give the beacon a power level of 1. Note that beacons require an unobstructed view of the sky (transparent blocks like glass are allowed, as well as bedrock in the nether ceiling). If you place more mineral blocks in a 5×5 square with the 3×3 square on top and a beacon on top of that, the beacon with have a power level of 2. You can continue adding bigger pyramid layers up to level 4 (see Beaconator advancement below).

To get this advancement, it doesn't matter what power level the beacon as on. As soon as the beacon is activated, it will shoot a beam of light to the sky, and you will get the advancement. Also, if you use the beacon, you can give it iron ingots, gold ingots, diamonds, emeralds, or netherite ingots to get special powers. The higher-level beacon you have, the better powers you can get.
