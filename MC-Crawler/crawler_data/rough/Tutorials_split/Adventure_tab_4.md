## Postmortal
Use a Totem of Undying to cheat death

Requirements: Take fatal damage while holding a Totem of Undying.

You need a totem of undying. These are dropped from evokers, which spawn only in woodland mansions or during a raid. Then, if you take fatal damage while holding the totem of undying in either hand (switch between hands by pressing F, better for dual wielding), you will not actually die; instead, you will use up your totem. Your health will regenerate (from Absorption and you gaining 1) and you will get the advancement. Any source of damage counts except for void damage, because totems can't save you from dying in the void.

The status effects you will get from the totem of undying are: 45 seconds of Regeneration II, 40 seconds of Fire Resistance, and 5 seconds of Absorption II. The totem of undying will remove all of your current status effects and apply these instead.

## Hired Help
Summon an Iron Golem to help defend a village

Requirements: Use 4 blocks of iron and 1 carved pumpkin to spawn an iron golem.

Summon an iron golem; summoning it in a village is not necessary. Gather 36 iron ingots and a carved pumpkin. Use the ingots to make 4 iron blocks, and place them in a "T" shape on the ground. Place the carved pumpkin on top of the top middle block. Blocks above and below the "arms" must be air.

This should spawn an iron golem, granting you the advancement. Iron golems will kill any nearby monsters except for creepers. Iron golems are considered neutral mobs when naturally generated (meaning they will attack you if provoked), but if a player summoned the iron golem, they will become passive toward the player.

## Star Trader
Trade with a Villager at the build height limit

Requirements: Stand on at least Y=319 and trade with a villager or wandering trader.

The usual way of completing this advancement requires the player to transport a villager to the build limit of 319, and then trade with it. The villager can be transported upward in a variety of ways. One of them is to use a vertical flying machine, with the benefit that a tower doesn't need to be constructed. The specific method is described in this video.

First, trap the villager in a boat. Dig a hole next to it, 5 blocks deep, 4 blocks long and 3 wide. Inside of that space, build a flying machine according to the screenshot: you need 2 sticky pistons, 2 observers, 2 slime blocks and 1 torch. Make sure that observers and sticky pistons are pointing in correct directions.

Completed machine with a villager next to it
Once the flying machine is finished, you need a water bucket, some blocks to make a platform up in the sky, and also something to trade with the villager (any trade works). If it's unemployed, a job site block for will also be needed: stonecutter or cartography table are recommended as they are easy to get and guarantee buying emeralds on the lowest level. In that case, you will obviously also need some emeralds.

Then get into the boat, move it on top of the machine and pour water next to it—below the level that the boat is on. This both will serve as a landing pad and flush the torch, activating your machine. Once the flying machine is activated, it will fly upward, carrying you and the villager with it. It takes about 2 minutes to fly from sea level to build limit. Once the machine reaches the build limit, it automatically stops. Now, you have to be very careful: exit the boat and perform the trade. Once that's done, you will receive the advancement.

To get down safely, you can either activate the flying machine to make it go downward (place a block next to the top observer), or simply disassemble the flying machine, and fall down into the water you placed below.

## Smithing with Style
Apply these smithing templates at least once: Spire, Snout, Rib, Ward, Silence, Vex, Tide, Wayfinder

Requirements: Apply all smithing templates listed above at least once.

As with the parent advancement, you need a smithing table. Next, you have to find eight specific armor trim smithing templates. Six of them can be obtained from chests in various structures, one comes from killing elder guardians, and one can be brushed from suspicious gravel.

| Smithing template    | Obtained from                            | Chance |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|--------|
| Spire Armor Trim     | End citychest                            | 6.7%   |
| Snout Armor Trim     | Bastion remnantchest                     | 8.3%   |
| Rib Armor Trim       | Nether fortresschest                     | 6.7%   |
| Ward Armor Trim      | Ancient citychest                        | 5%     |
| Silence Armor Trim   | Ancient citychest                        | 1.2%   |
| Vex Armor Trim       | Woodland mansiongeneric chest            | 50%    |
| Tide Armor Trim      | Killing anelder guardian                 | 20%    |
| Wayfinder Armor Trim | Brushing suspicious gravel intrail ruins | 8.3%   |

It is recommended to duplicate each of these before applying them on armor, as that uses up the template.

When you have all eight trims, apply one of each type to an armor piece in your smithing table. When the 8th one is applied, you will get the advancement.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 150 experience.

Kill two Phantoms with a piercing arrow

Requirements: Shoot a crossbow with the enchantment Piercing at two phantoms with one arrow.

You need to kill two phantoms with one crossbow shot. To achieve that, the crossbow must be enchanted with any level of Piercing.

Phantoms spawn after three in-game days wherein the player does not sleep (unless the game rule doInsomnia is set to false). They have 20 × 10 health, and thus cannot be killed with just one crossbow shot: it deals 7 of damage at minimum, 9 at average, and 11 × 5.5 at maximum, therefore requiring at least two shots. You can try damaging phantoms first with a melee weapon or arrow shots, but it is very hard to keep track of which phantom was damaged, if a whole group is swooping at you. It is also very hard to line them up for one shot. To make this easier, use boats.

Step 1: Setup
Using this method requires a crossbow with at least Piercing III. Also, don't wear any armor with Thorns during the task. 

Place two boats on top of 2-block high pillars, close to each other, preferably in a flat, open biome rich with animals, like plains. Lure animals into the boats and place them inside as passengers, one in each boat. Kill any other nearby animals, so that nothing else enters these boats. Stay in the area and wait for the night.

Two boats prepared
Step 2: Phantoms
At night, if you haven't slept for three days, phantoms will spawn and swoop down at you. Stand near the boats, until a phantom gets stuck in each one as its second passenger. Kill any other phantoms that spawned. Now, press F3+B to see hitboxes of mobs: you can easily control how much health each phantom has by hitting its hitbox.

Phantom's hitbox sticks out of the boat's hitbox
Hit each phantom with a stone axe twice, without criticals or strength effect (make sure to not hit the boat's hitbox, as it will break the boat and let phantom free!). This reduces their health from 20 × 10 to 2. Now kill the animal in front seat of each boat. After that, you can see phantom's hitbox is entirely within boat's hitbox, thus being nearly impossible to hit; this is why you needed these front-seat passengers.

Step 3: The shot
Place an additional block next to two pillars for you to stand on (here it is represented by a cobblestone block):

Setup ready for the shot
Stand on that block and sneak. You are now lined up perfectly for the shot. Load up your crossbow (don't do that pointing at a boat, as you will enter it...), aim at the phantom and shoot. Arrow will pierce through both phantoms and both boats, killing all 4 entities and granting you the advancement.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 65 experience.
