### 
Construct a hallway. A diagonal hallway works best. Fence posts should be underneath the path and you should drop the sand or gravel for the floor on the fences. Below the fences, you can have a pit.

This works because when a gravity-affected block falls on a fence post, the block stays as an entity. As a result, a player walking between the fence posts will fall through the sand entities, causing them to plummet. Diagonal hallways make it more likely to fall through the sand without landing safely on a fence post. Keep in mind that the sand is going to look half a block higher than a normal block, but this can easily be covered up. The best part: it does not need to be reset!

### 
1. Dig a 2×2 hole until you reach a drop which would ruin any player's day.
2. Place 4 hoppers, one per block on the 2×2 hole, pointing into chests.
3. Build some kind of hall to access the chests below.

This can work in conjunction with other traps. The player drops down into the pit, and at the bottom, they die and their items are sucked into the hoppers for you to use.

### Painting trap


















A painting trap. Place painting(s) instead of vines.
This trap is easy to make. It hides a secret passage behind a painting. The target may unwittingly decide to check for a secret passage behind the painting. Big mistake.

### Fake chunk error
Dig a 16×16 hole, preferably in line with real chunks, at least 20 blocks deep. Some inexperienced players may think it is a chunk error and walk-in.


### Fake water pitfall















































Fake water, fake secret passage.
Dig a hole (2×2 works best) at least 30 blocks deep, the deeper the better. At the bottom place a block of lapis lazuli, a block of blue wool or a block of blue stained glass. Add a false corridor at the bottom to make it look like it goes somewhere. When an unsuspecting player comes across the hole, they may think that there is water at the bottom, jump down and die. Experienced players are less likely to fall for this particular trap but it generally works quite well. You can also place real water instead of blocks if you're wearing frost walker boots, just go down there, hide in the fake secret passage and sneak to hide nametag. Use F5 to see if a player is coming. If someone falls down, quickly move to freeze the water.


### Snowball trap





















Snowball trap.
Load a dispenser with snowballs (or other knockback item), and connect it to a pressure plate. When the target walks across the plate, the dispenser, if aimed correctly, shoots a snowball and knocks the target into the pit. You can also replace the dispenser with a piston.


### Piston pit






























Automatic piston pitfall
Place the piston so it pushes the block the signs are on. The player can make up to twelve rows using one piston. Make sure there is a block of empty space at the end of where the piston pushes. Connect the piston to a trigger, such a pressure plate or lever, and when the piston moves it should break the signs and cause the sand to fall along with the target. It is also possible to do this by pushing a line of blocks with torches or buttons on them, which may be slightly cheaper. Alternatively, use a sticky piston connected to a NOT gate which retracts a block with a sign on it, which allows the player to use more than 12 rows.


### Fake elevator































Fake water elevator































Real water elevator
Make what is shown in the schematic, a water elevator with water only on the top block. Make sure the hole is 30-40 blocks deep, which is enough to kill the player. It could help to place a lure sign near the 'elevator' saying something like "Do not enter!" You can also make the signs' text something like a floor countdown like "35", "34", "33", etc. so players are more likely to fall for the trap. If they want, you can place hoppers with chests so you can gather the loot from the victims, but if they really want the drops, they will need a secret passage to the bottom of the pit for collection.


### False-floor trap
A false-floor trap is a variation of a pitfall trap. It works by creating a concealed safe route through the pitfall to allow authorized players to pass, while catching unauthorized players or mobs and killing them. It generally works best when there is no way around, forcing the player to pass through the trap.

1. Dig a pit. The deeper and longer the better.
2. PlaceTNTto build a bridge across the pit. It should be at least 2 blocks wide, preferably more as someone could cheat otherwise.
3. Replace some of the TNT withtorches. Read the next step to understand which ones to replace.
4. On top of the torches, placesandorgravel. Try to get across the bridge now by only stepping on the sand. Make sure you can do it, because it will be even harder at the end as you must stay off the edges of the sand.
5. Once you have picked a satisfactory path, cover up the TNT with the same blocks as before.
6. Placepressure platesover all the sand/gravel.

If anyone steps on one of the pressure plates with TNT under it, the TNT will explode causing the whole bridge to collapse! Note: You will need to have something under the TNT, perhaps more TNT or something easily destructible to make sure the TNT doesn't fall and fail to ignite the rest of the TNT.
