### Beds
Beds can be extremely useful for dealing large amounts of damage to the dragon. Placing them down when the ender dragon is on the exit portal and blowing them up removes up to 1/5 of the ender dragon's health. Although this is a good strategy, it is extremely dangerous and you have to be careful. The main way to not take damage is going inside the exit portal, placing a bed, putting a block next to that bed and then right-clicking. Doing this negates the damage to you, even without Blast Protection armor, as the explosion does not go down to hit your legs and the block you placed prevents your head from being hit. However, it is recommended to bring at least one piece of Blast Protection armor as a failsafe, just in case you accidentally leave yourself exposed to the explosion.

Alternatively, end crystals may be used in place of beds. If you place several end crystals on the portal, wait for the dragon to swoop down and perch on the portal, then shoot the crystals with a bow or throw a egg/snowball at it. The dragon takes the explosive damage, plus 10 extra points of damage if the crystal was destroyed while the dragon is charging from it. This is significantly safer than using beds, and end crystal explosions don't create fires that beds do. However, end crystals are more expensive than beds, and it causes significant damage to the terrain.

You can also use a bed to set your spawn point in the Overworld just before you jump through the end portal, which allows you to return quickly in case of death.

### Optional items
There are more items that are useful in the End, but are not needed to beat the fight:

- A torch to collect thedragon eggafter the battle
- Anender chestto bring additional items into the End. Note that you can only reclaim the chest with aSilk Touchpickaxe. As the ender chest inventory can be accessed from any dimension using any ender chest, you can also use it to protect valuables such as the dragon egg or any loot you might find.
- Empty glass bottles to collect dragon's breath
- A carved pumpkin which preventsendermenfrom getting aggressive
- Iron blocks to build aniron golem, which deals with the endermen
- Tridentsare good weapons for the fight as well, but they should haveLoyalty. You can also useRiptideto boost yourself up with the help of a water bucket. Note: If your trident goes into the void, it does not return even if it is enchanted with loyalty.‌[Java Edition  only]
- Having atotem of undyingin your offhand saves you from death once. This can be helpful if things go wrong, but note that totems don't protect from falling into thevoid. You can get totems of undying from killing anEvokerin aWoodland Mansionor during avillage raid.
- Having wood can allow you to craft chests which can ultimately allow you to craft shulker boxes from the shulker shells that you get from end cities.
- If you are going to explore the outer islands in search forend cities, bring somefirework rockets. Once you findelytra, you can fly back home without having to take agateway portal. You can also bring an anvil, a Mending book and an Unbreaking III book to instantly enchant your elytra, giving you extended flight time and an option to repair them by killing endermen.
- If you are playing on Bedrock Edition, you can brew potions of harming, put them in cauldrons, and make tipped arrows of harming which can increase your damage to the dragon a lot. Note: tipped arrows are not affected byInfinity.

## Journey to the portal
All players begin the ender dragon fight with eyes of ender, because they are needed to locate and activate the end portal, which is found in a stronghold. To make one, you need one ender pearl and one piece of blaze powder. You need to set aside 12, because you need up to 12 to activate the portal, and you also need a few extra eyes to find the stronghold.

### Stronghold
To find the stronghold, throw an eye of ender into the air, and it floats upward in the direction of the nearest stronghold. It then falls back to the ground and you can pick it up and throw it again. Note that the eye has a chance of breaking when you throw it, so bring at least 15 eyes to spare. Make sure to go into third person view before throwing an eye so you can see the direction the eye flies in as well as whether it breaks or where it falls in case the eye flies behind you. Follow the ender eyes until they float downward, which indicates that a stronghold is underneath. If the eyes direct you to a village, the stronghold is most likely located under the village's meeting point.‌[BE  only]

Dig underground to find the stronghold. You might dig into a cave or even a ravine, so it could be difficult to find. Use water to put out any lava that is in the way. Keep exploring the cave or keep digging until you see stone bricks, which indicates that you have found the stronghold. Once you break in, get out your torches so that you can mark your exit and light up the area. You should also block off dead end passages with cobblestone to avoid getting lost.

#### Triangulation
An alternate method for locating strongholds is to use the angles, in which ender eyes move from two different points to mathematically calculate the coordinates of the stronghold. Given the coordinates of two points in the world, (X1, Z1) and (X2, Z2), and the exact angles at which eyes of ender move, A1 and A2 (all of which can be measured from the F3 debug screen), the stronghold is at the following coordinates:

X = (Z1 - Z2 - X2cot(A2) + X1cot(A1)) / (cot(A1) - cot(A2))

Z = (X2 - X1 - Z1tan(A1) + Z2tan(A2)) / (tan(A2) - tan(A1)),

where tan(x) is the tangent function and cot(x) is the cotangent. By using this method to find the starting point for searching, it is usually possible to find the stronghold using only three or four ender eyes.
