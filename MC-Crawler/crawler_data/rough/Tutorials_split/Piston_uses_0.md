# Tutorials/Piston uses
Since pistons were introduced in Beta 1.7, players have been experimenting with their potential uses. Below are some demonstrations and guides. The interest in pistons is their ability to manipulate the position of other blocks.

Please however keep in mind that as of the "Better Together" update on console editions that "Quasi-connectivity" has been removed and its function replaced with the observer block. In doing so, many of the contraptions listed below might have been made non-functional.

## Flush doors
A flush door is a piston door that is completely hidden in the wall that it is in. Unfortunately, due to the lack of quasi-connectivity, the first two designs do not work in Bedrock Edition, though there are other designs that work.

Pros:

- Easy to build.
- Simple.
- Requires few materials compared to hidden piston stairs.
- Easy to modify. For example, you can modify it to open with a self-destructinglever, or you can use mods like OpenComputers and use the computer to request a password to open the door.

Cons:

- To blend in well into the environment, you need astoneordirtwall. Stone walls can be found on themountainsbiome(and its variants).
- If you need to build it on aplainsbiome or other flat terrain, you need to somehow blend the door on the environment. If this is impossible for some reason, the only choice is the hidden piston stairs.
- Players can accidentally mine the door, as no one knows there's a door on the wall.
