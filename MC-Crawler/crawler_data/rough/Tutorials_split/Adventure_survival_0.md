# Tutorials/Adventure survival
Surviving in Adventure mode can be very difficult because you can not place blocks or break them without the proper tools (i.e. a pickaxe for stone). However, it is still possible to survive in this mode by finding resources in villages and dungeons, among other things.

## Setting up an Adventure world
The way to survive is choosing a normal world with generated structures. This is because there are jungle pyramids, mineshafts, desert pyramids, woodland mansions, shipwrecks, villages, dungeons, pillager outposts, strongholds, buried treasures, ocean ruins, ruined portals, igloos, swamp huts, nether fortress, bastions, nether fossils, end cities, ocean monuments, and ancient cities which can all be looted. If you want to, you can also enable "Bonus Chest" to generate a bonus chest. Once the terrain is loaded, using command /gamemode Adventure @s will switch the player into Adventure mode. If you want to, you can use a seed that have a stronghold that have an active end portal (because of the fact that you can't insert eye into end portal frame in Adventure mode), which have an chance of 1 in 1,000,000,000,000.

## Surviving
When you first spawn into your world, kill any mobs you come across, except for villagers, but make sure that you leave at least 2 of each animal, for breeding later. Try to sprint and jump as little as possible to save food. Killing sheep can be useful for their mutton, but remember that there is no use making a bed with their wool, as it cannot be placed in Adventure mode. However, you can sleep in beds inside village houses.

Don't eat raw meat unless you're desperate; wait until you cook it in a furnace in a village blacksmith or in igloos. You can also trade it for emeralds if you wish, though this won't achieve much in the long run, unless you save up for diamond tools or armor. Many villager trades can be cheap and not worthwhile, so it's important to know what trades will be useful in the long run. See the trading article for more information.

### Villages
A library in a plains biome village before the Village & Pillage update.
The most important thing to do early in the game is to search for a village. For plains villages, if the village does not have a weaponsmith or a small house with a crafting table, search for another village, but take note of the first village's coordinates. You will have a much easier time if you find a plains village with both a weaponsmith and a small house with a crafting table. Use the crafting table in the small house for crafting and the 2 furnaces in the blacksmith for cooking meat. Crafting table can also spawn in igloo, pillager outposts, and witch huts.

The easiest way to find a village is to first find a savanna, desert, taiga, plains, snowy taigaâ€Œ[BE  only], snowy tundra or meadow biome, and look throughout the whole biome. There is a good chance that once you have found one of these biomes, a part of that biome will contain a village. If you've found a village that does not have a furnace or a house with a crafting table, take notes of the coordinates and search for another village. That way, you will at least have a place to stay safe for the night.

While crafting tables can be found in some village small houses, only some buildings generate furnaces.

- In the plains and desert villages, a furnace can only be found in village weaponsmith which contains 2 furnaces.
- In the savanna village, a furnace can only be found in one of village weaponsmith variants which contain 2 furnaces.
- In the taiga and snowy taiga villages, a furnace can only be found in one of village medium house variants, which contain a single furnace.
- In the snowy tundra village, a furnace can be found in most houses, such as in small houses, medium houses andmasonhouses.

A furnace can also spawn in ancient cities.

Smoker and campfire can also be used as furnace alternatives since the main use is only for cooking, and these blocks cannot smelt non-food resources. You can find a smoker in each village butcher shop, while campfires can only be found in taiga and snowy taiga villages.

A smoker cooks food twice faster than a furnace, while campfires cook food three times longer than a furnace and can only cook up to 4 items, but can cook different foods at the same time and don't require fuel.

After you have found a village and settled in, loot the chest in all buildings. Use the lava as a trash can for useless stuff you find in the chest or obtained from creeper explosions (see below). You can now use this chest for your storage purposes.

- Barrelsin the villagefishermanhouse can also be used to store items.
- Taiga and snowy taiga village buildings don't generate lava.

If the village bell is reachable by many villagers and there are enough villagers for gossiping, and you have enough armor and preparation, you can kill the iron golem for its iron ingots. However, be very careful, as you can't tower up to kill iron golems (unless your world have a favorable terrain), iron golems have lots of health, and can deal great amounts of damage. Iron golems can also spawn in pillager outposts.
