### Pickaxe
When the player enters the End, they might spawn underground, so some kind of pickaxe is vital to mine through end stone to reach the surface. Having a regular diamond pickaxe is just fine, you can enchant it with Efficiency to dig your way free faster. A pickaxe of any type with Silk Touch is necessary to reclaim an ender chest.

An iron pickaxe (or even stone) is enough if you are not going to mine additional end stone and if you have brought enough building blocks.

### 
As you are going to receive a lot of damage from the dragon or the endermen, healing items are critical to survive the fight. The higher the difficulty, the more food/healing you are going to need.

- Golden applesare the most efficient healing item because they provideAbsorption, which grants the player 4temporary health, as well as theRegenerationeffect which restores another 4health over 5 seconds. Beginners should bring a lot of them to avoid dying.
	- Enchanted golden applesprovideAbsorption IV, which grants the player 16× 8temporary health and restore 16× 8health over 20 seconds. They are however difficult to find, so save them for an emergency if you found one.
- Golden carrotsare a highly nutritious food, but quite expensive if crafted from the base materials.
- Suspicious stewscrafted withdandelionsorblue orchidsgive the player theSaturationeffect, which restores the player'ssaturationlevel to full. It can be used to restore 16× 8inJava Edition, making it a cheap alternative to restore lots of hearts in case the player runs low on health.
- Cooked porkchops,steak,breadandcooked salmonare other nutritious foods to bring to the End.

You should bring at least one stack of food items to prevent starving and allow for quick regeneration.

Also, potent healing potions and extended regeneration potions can bail you out of low-health scenarios quickly. It is recommended to convert them to splash potions to skip the drinking time.

### Potions
Potions are extremely useful in the fight to enhance the player’s performance. Aside from the already mentioned healing/regeneration potions, here are some more potions to bring to the End:

- Slow falling potionsare helpful, because they negate the fall damage of the dragon’s knockback ability. A bucket of water can serve the same purpose, but because of the slow fall, you also have more time to react in case you are kicked off the island, so you can save yourself with an ender pearl.
- Night vision potionscan be nice to have, because the End is dark and it helps you see better. However,end stone's bright texture contrasting withobsidian,endermenand the dragon's darker textures makes this optional, although you may confuse the void's darkness with endermen.
- Strength potionsboost your melee damage against the dragon andendermen.
- Leaping potionsandswiftness potionscan be used to boost the player's movement during the fight.
- Poison potionsandharming potionscan be used to damage the dragon when it perches down or in the air.

### Ender pearls
Ender pearls are extremely useful to have in the End. The player can use them to get up to the tops of tall towers, or if the spawn platform is away from the island, the player can use them so that they don't have to waste their blocks. 

Pearls can also be used to save yourself from getting kicked off the island or fall damage. Unfortunately, pearls don't fall faster than the player at most velocities, so throw the pearl straight down around 1 second before you would hit the ground. However, ender pearls cause damage to the player and has a slight chance of spawning an endermite, a hostile mob that deals damage to you on contact.

If you get knocked high in the air with a slow falling potion active, you can also use pearls to quickly return to solid ground.

### Blocks
Blocks can be useful for climbing up the towers or to pillar up in order to get a better angle to shoot the end crystals. You might also have to bridge over from the spawn platform if you do not have any ender pearls. Harder blocks, such as cobblestone, offer no advantage compared to softer blocks such as netherrack, since the dragon destroys blocks instantly regardless of their hardness or blast resistance. End stone, which has the additional benefit of being dragon-proof, can also be used for this. It is recommended to use blocks to climb the taller towers and just shoot the end crystals on the short ones from the ground. However, the player might build to the top of the towers that have cages around the end crystals. Alternatively, they can throw an ender pearl to get to the top. The player can choose to use blocks or ender pearls to bridge to the central island if they spawned on an obsidian platform outside of the main island.

An alternative to blocks is Scaffolding, which can be placed even faster and are climbable. However, if the dragon collides with them at a low point, it will cause every piece above that point to break, potentially resulting in heavy fall damage. A good way around this is to wait until the dragon is perched before placing your scaffolding.

You should bring several stacks of blocks because mining end stone is slow, especially without a tool enchanted with Efficiency.

### Ladders
Ladders can be an alternative to blocks to climb the obsidian pillars as the player does not need to break the ladders to get down. Ladders are generally easier to place down unlike blocks in which case the player must jump every time. Ladders can also be used to prevent fall damage, but this is difficult, and should just be replaced with a water bucket or Slow Falling potion to prevent fall damage.

### Water bucket
A water bucket is extremely useful to have when the player fights the dragon, and even before the fight begins. It can be used to put out lava that is encountered while looking for the end portal. In the End, if the player falls off a tower and doesn't have enough ender pearls or slow falling potions, players can try to place a water bucket below their feet just before they land (water bucket MLG). The timing, however, is very tight, and messing up can have potentially fatal results. Water can also help them deal with provoked endermen. If an enderman is pursuing the player, dump the water at their feet (or yours) and the enderman takes damage and teleports away. The water also neutralizes the enderman on Java Edition, causing it to ignore the player again.

Water buckets are another alternative to get to the top of towers, although this requires a little training.

It is also possible to use several water buckets to make a infinite water generator and flood big parts of the island. This gets any endermen out of the way and removes the need for slow falling potions or water bucket MLGs.
