### Gaining resources
Gathering resources in Adventure mode can be difficult, as blocks cannot be mined or placed.

One extremely useful tactic is to get creepers to blow up a house, farm in a village, terrain, terrain feature, feature, or other structures; this way, you can get wood and cobblestone. Wheat can be used to breed animals or crafted into bread, though seeds cannot be replanted. Trampling is a more efficient way as you will not lose any of the wheat, however, melon farms in savanna and desert villages and pumpkin farms in taiga and snowy taiga  are useless due to trampling stem drop seeds while pumpkins and melon are unbreakable. since you cannot place or destroy blocks in Adventure mode; only blocks that are used in crafting or for trading can be useful.

If you are lucky and have enough supplies, you can get creepers to blow up gravel and craft flint and steel which can only be used to ignite creepers or TNT. You can also make arrows with flint, although this is probably unnecessary because they can be obtained by killing skeletons. Note that bone meal cannot be used on pre-mature wheat, since that counts as interacting with a block or object.‌[Java Edition  only]

A fishing rod can also be useful since it not only gives you infinite amounts of fish but can also give you junk and treasure items which can be useful in Adventure mode. Village animal pens and plains stables can also be used as a makeshift pen for animals and mobs.

Endermen have the ability to move blocks and they are your only way to do such a thing.

Once you are done with a village, take as many useful items as you can from your chest and head off for the next village. Repeat the above steps if necessary and see how long you can survive! It's also possible to find a mineshaft, dungeon, strongholds or even an ancient city by exploring caves. Although there are extremely valuable items you can find in chests, it is also extremely dangerous. For entering the stronghold, seek out the dead end of a corridor by exploring around in caves because sometimes dead-end corridors have an open hole to the cave.

If you prefer to explore the ocean, shipwrecks and buried treasures (for those you'll need to remove the sand covering the chest with creepers) are the only structures which can be looted, as you cannot dig the blocks covering the chests in ocean ruins, making that structure useless, another structure that is useless is ocean monuments which provide nothing more than just a challenge due to you being unable to break sponge and gold block, nor use prismarine from guardians as you cannot place blocks made from the prismarine you crafted.

You can also find lootable structures on the surface. They are: jungle temples, pillager outposts, woodland mansions, and swamp huts (swamp huts continuously spawn witches).

### The Nether
Accessing the Nether in Adventure mode is really difficult but not impossible. To build the nether portal you need to find a 5 blocks deep lava pool and to use creepers to funnel water so that it converts the bottom-most layer of lava into obsidian. Then, using the endermen's ability to place blocks, you need to remove all the lava sources except those which will create the portal. Endermen however will only place blocks where there is air, meaning that you will need a platform over the lava pool where endermen could place gravity affected blocks, then a creeper to blow up the platform to make those blocks fall into the lava and remove the lava sources you don't need.
You can then funnel more water to convert the remaining lava into obsidian, remove the water you used with the endermen's help once more and remove the blocks you used to remove the lava by exploding a creeper.

Now you need to light the nether portal. There are 2 ways to do it:

- 1-block tall flowers are the only blocks (besides TNT but it will ignite when on fire) that are both enderman pickable and flameable blocks. But they need to have a dirt, grass block, or mud... block below so the flowers will place, and they don't break by flowing lava.

- You need atridentenchanted withChanneling(as you can't enchant in Adventure mode it needs to be dropped enchanted by a drowned) to light up the portal. A chippedanvilgenerate in the woodland mansion at the forge room, it can be used to enchant and combine tools for several use before the anvil breaks, but its unnecessary to come there just for enchanting with enchanted books as woodland mansion is a rare structure and not all mansions may generate a room with anvil. When you have aChannelingtrident, you can light the portal by hit an entity with thattrident. The entity can be amob, anotherplayer, or even anitem frame(although you can't place or break blocks in Adventure mode, you can place or break entity such asboats,boat with chests,minecarts,item frames,paintings...).

Also, if you’re lucky enough, nether portal can be built by the world generation. There is a super small chance that a ruined portal generates inside the "lava room" in a woodland mansion. That ruined portal will need to fit the obsidian frame of the lava room, and doesn't have any crying obsidian. Finally the lava in the ruined portal will catch fire of the wood in woodland mansion. Over time, this will light the portal. Although it's very rare, some seeds already have this.[more information needed]
