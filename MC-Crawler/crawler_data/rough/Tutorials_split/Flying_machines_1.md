### Extensions
Extensions are mechanical parts of a fully-automatic flying machine used to push an independent part of a large flying structure. A single piston only can push or pull up to 12 blocks. Extensions use additional pistons to "extend" a slime structure by allowing more blocks to be pushed.

#### One-way extension
A one-way extension has 2 parts: a normal piston in the rear, and a slime block (or more) with a power source in the front with space between them.

Once the rear part with the piston is pushed, the piston will be activated by a power source from the front part. It will push the slime block (and thus the next part of the flying contraption and its extensions), which pulls the power source with it. The piston will then deactivate and prepare for another push.


Some simple engines are just made of looped extensions, such that, at any given time one piston is always powered (in these machines it is important to place the redstone blocks last).
A 1-way extension. The piston will be powered by quasi-connectivity.
#### Two-way extensions
An example of how extensions can be used to create more complex structures such as this train.
A two-way extension consists of an observer powering at least one sticky piston which pushes or pulls a part of the flying contraption. This is possible only in Java Edition because it's the only version where sticky pistons (upon receiving a short redstone pulse) can push a block and then retract quickly without pulling it back.


This type of extension will either continuously pull or push depending on whether the part it's supposed to move is initially retracted or not. If the part is initially retracted and the extension is continuously pulled, the sticky piston will continuously pull the part. On the other hand, if the part is one block away ("not retracted") and the extensions is continuously pushed, the sticky piston will continuously push the part. This mechanism necessitates a switch within the flying machine to independently retract and extend the extension before flight, because otherwise, the engine will most likely be unable to push due to the "stuck" retracted extensions adding extra load to the engine's pistons.



### Driveable flying machines
A flying machine can be designed to not only carry a player along, but allow them to control the machine in flight, starting, stopping, or changing directions. Often due to lag, slime engines can bug allowing the player to fall through the machine. This can be solved by placing the player in a vehicle such as a minecart, by standing on top of a honey block, or by standing inside a Composter.Note: Placing a minecart in any such build will require a temporary rail, perhaps atop a temporary block for convenience.

Starting the engine of a flying machine often involves updating a piston or observer. Braking, on the other hand, isn't as straightforward to do in survival because a piston-immovable block must be present to stop the engine. A reliable braking method that was first popularized by SethBling is to attach a noteblock (or any similar redstone component movable by pistons) to the "face" of an observer that powers a piston. The piston is placed on the front of the engine, and since extended pistons cannot be pushed by other pistons, activating the noteblock at the right time will stop the engine. 

By using sticky pistons instead of pistons for the braking components, they also become 2-way extensions. These can be used to carry extra blocks, such as holders for minecarts/minecart chests, passenger roofs, TNT duplicators, etc.

#### 
Dimensions: 8x4 collapsed
Materials: 4 observers, 10 slime blocks, 2 sticky pistons, 2 regular or sticky pistons, 4 note blocks. For seating: 2 fences, 2 minecarts
Usage: To start left or right, click the note block with that arrow (behind you). To stop, spam-click the matching barred note block (ahead of you).

#### 
A version of Drivable machine A, modified by kurzawa6's, with minecart chests and a roof attached to the 2 two-way spliters. One extension carries a roof to protect the driver from phantoms, the other carries a cargo module with two minecarts (optionally with chests)

Dimensions: 10x6, 2 high minimum, 5 high with roof.
Notes:The slime block marked a can get another slime block above it, with top slabs on each side sheltering the passenger/cargo minecarts.
The starred minecart is the "pilot's seat".
Before going either way, first make sure the roof is retracted by clicking the <̅ block, and the cargo is retracted by clicking the >̅ block.
To go either way , click the appropriate < >. To stop, spam-click the matching barred block <̅ >̅ .

#### 
A 2-way machine which can be reconfigured in the field to go the other two ways, by mining and replacing four blocks. It can carry two passengers, and has two cargo bays for minecarts with chests (or plain minecarts, for passengers). It uses 20 slime blocks including the cargo bays. Its use is complex, but may be worthwhile just for bragging rights.

Dimensions: 8x10, 3 high.
Diagram from video, showing ignition points and note blocks used for each direction. Note: This image is "sideways", with east and west shown as as up and down.
Usage: The machine is started by updating an observer (one of the two with open faces) twice, using a flint-and-steel or a water bucket.
- To go east:
	- Set fire (or water) behind the west-most observer.
	- Sit in the eastern minecart.
	- Before the fire extinguishes, click the note block nearest you to release the brake.
	- Wait for the fire to burn out (or remove the water) to trigger that observer again and start the engine.
	- To stop the engine, spam-click the same note block. Check that the carrier for your minecart is retracted, if not, click the note block again to retract it.
- To go west, do the same in mirror image.
- To switch to north-south movement:
	- mine the starred pistons (note the helpful logs below them) and rotate them a quarter-turn clockwise -- still facing outward, but the other outward
	- likewise, mine the starred observers, and put them in the positions and directions of the arrows.
	- To move north and south, similarly twice trigger the "rear" observer, and use the nearer note block to release the brake and stop the engine.
