#### Tripwire hook
When a player/mob/item comes in contact with a string connected to 2 tripwire hooks, it will output a redstone signal.

Pros:

- Can detect all entities
- Wide range of detection

Cons:

- Hooks can be seen easily when placed on a wall
- String connected to it can be broken withshearswithout outputting a signal

### Button
When a button is pressed, it outputs a redstone signal. Useful for redstone control rooms.

### Daylight sensor
It detects the 'time' of Minecraft day. It can be right clicked to detect sun or moon. Shadow affects this, however, so if you set it to detect sun, and it is in direct sunlight, a redstone signal will be produced, at a power level relating to the height of sun or moon. If it was in shadow, it would not produce any signal, and vice-versa for moon mode. Useful for hourly traps and such, though redstone clocks are more precise but also expensive. 

It has no effect on adjacent opaque blocks.

### Lectern
The lectern can hold books. It emits a redstone signal power depending upon the page of the displayed book. Useful when you want to tempt someone with important information, and blow them up as soon as they start reading a particular page.

## Mechanism components
These components actually affect the target.

### TNT
Of course, that's obviously coming to your mind first. TNT traps are ubiquitous and common. Most like the landmine (involving a pressure plate and some TNT) are easy to make; others like the TNT floor house are harder and more expensive. TNT traps have many triggers; from pressure plates to observers to pistons to dispensers...and more!

### Pistons
Pistons are often used, for example, to push a player into lava, push someone into a pressure plate, push someone into a block and suffocate them, and more. They are often used in some capture traps to continuously keep a player out of an area.

### Dispensers
Dispensers can be used to shoot out deadly objects like Potions, Arrows, Tipped Arrows, Fire Charges, Lava, etc.

Don't ever put diamonds in a dispenser unless you are trying to lure someone, or else they will just become rich off your trap

### Nether Portals
Nether Portals can be used to make traps upon entering The Nether. They pause chunk generation, witch means you light TNT in the Overworld over a Nether Portal, then light the portal. as long as there is no chunk generator (Machine That Uses A Minecart In A Nether Portal To Load Chunks) or players in the nether, you, upon entering the nether, will be blown up.

### Mobs
Mobs, like Zombies, Skeletons, Witches, Ravagers, Creepers, Iron Golems, Zoglins, Vindicators, Piglin Brutes and Pufferfish can deal damage to players. To prevent mobs inside of traps from despawning, one should use Name tags. Each mob has their own pros and cons:

- Zombies—Most common mob to obtain and quite flexible, but can be killed easily. Burns in sunlight.
- Skeletons—Ideal for long-range traps without hiding spots, like long hallways and corridors. Slow rate of fire and no melee damage makes them ineffective for smaller traps. Burns in sunlight.
- Witches—Splash potions are effective against weaker victims, and they have a large area of effect. Self-healing ensures longevity. The unpredictability and inconsistency with the types of potions thrown makes them ineffective at killing victims.
- Ravagers—Powerful and deals significant knockback. The large hitbox of the Ravager can make them difficult to contain.
- Creepers—Deals explosive damage. In Survival, the difficulty of transporting them and the one-time use of Creepers makes them an awful choice compared to simple and effective TNT.
- Iron Golems—Powerful. Can be repaired/healed withiron ingots. Only attacks if it is attacked first.
- Hoglins/Zoglins—Powerful. Attack almost anything and everything they see. They can be difficult to transport out of the Nether due to their fear of Nether Portals.
- Vindicators—High damage output. Attack all mobs exceptghastsandillagersif renamed to "Johnny". Has a short attack range.
- Piglin Brutes—Deal the same amount of damage as vindicators. Convert into a normalzombified piglinsupon leaving the Nether.
- Pufferfish—Moderate damage, inflicts poison. They can be picked up in buckets and placed by dispensers.

## Explosive traps
The traps here primarily use TNT to cause harm to the target. When testing explosive traps it may be a good idea to use a different block such as the redstone lamp, which like TNT, is triggered by redstone but it is less likely to accidentally blow up prematurely.

### Lectern info bait
Lecterns can hold books, therefore, you could give a hint to someone about some important info, and set it up so as soon as they reach the sixth page maybe, the doors close, and TNT blows up the place. Don't set it to explode at the first page, they would go through the first few pages cautiously, and then feel safe, only to find out while they are reading the most important page, TNT removes them from the Minecraft world.

### Trick house trap
This is a trap that can be used to catch someone while they are out adventuring. You place TNT at various points around their house, prioritizing spots which are behind an input like a button or likely to be set alight by an unsuspecting player, like behind an empty fireplace. To finish it all off, place a few pressure plates near their bed with TNT underneath. If the player dies and respawns, they would spawn on top of the pads and cause an easy kill. Keep in mind that some servers would consider this sort of behavior cheating or griefing.
