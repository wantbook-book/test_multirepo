### Pond
This is easy to make, and can be useful, especially if you don't have a wheat farm yet. Just make a hole long enough to cast your fishing rod, around 8 blocks long and at least 2 blocks deep, and fill it with water.

### Music room
A room filled with note blocks to enjoy melodies. This can be made with or without redstone repeaters.

### Library
Not only is it a great use for any excess sugar cane, a library can also add a bit of class to your home. Can double as an enchantment room.

### Minecart hub
If you have active mines scattered over the map and use minecarts to haul your stuff back to your base, dig out a universal stopping point under your base. Or, you could actually make a rail road hub outside or connected to your base.

### Minecart chest system
After many in-game days in Minecraft, you eventually gain the resources to automate everything (farms, doors, etc.). The most useful automation you can make is a minecart chest system. You can simply craft minecarts with chests, powered rails, and some rails, and you can make a system to send your ores from your mine to your base,

### Gravel-to-flint room
Once you have many stacks of gravel, it can be useful to convert most (leave some for mining) of your gravel into flint. This is just a big empty room (a 4×4×4 space holds a stack of blocks), which you fill with gravel, before destroying the gravel, getting some flint in the process. It is most efficient to do this 10-15 times for every 20 stacks, though about 5 for 10 stacks, and 30 for 50 or so stacks. This room may include a chest with shovels, as well as ingredients and a crafting table for quick production of arrows, and flint and steel. 

This is somewhat redundent, since a Fletcher can trade you 10 Gravel and an emerald to 10 Flint. A stack is 6 Emeralds with 4 gravel left over and if you have a tree farm, two logs, 10 gravel, and a bit of trading can get you 10 Flint.

### Target practice rooms
Make this room dimly lit, so hostile mobs can spawn, when you enter this room, always close the doors when entering and exiting, arm yourself and kill the mobs in there. Light the entrance area with torches. This helps you gain experience and loot.

### 
Make this room with a supply of bows, arrows, and several colorful blocks, such as dyed wool, (to determine distance rank) at different distances with buttons on each one facing you with each one hooked up to a redstone lamp. Target blocks are a good item to use, too.

### Bridge
If your base is near a lake, a bridge can help you cross to get resources and give you a safe spot to fish. Just create a 3-block wide path (using cobblestone would be a good idea) through the water, and you have a basic bridge! When you have time, you may want to add a ceiling+walls (for safety at night from mobs and during storms) and slits in the side (as either a dock or a place to fish.)

### Bathroom
If one wants to fish indoors or drown themselves, a bathroom is perfect for them! Make a bath, a toilet and if the player is good with redstone, a shower with pistons is always a good idea for those who want to show their home to others. When the walls are made of cobblestone, make a hopper attached to a dropper or a dispenser to make a sink (just add a lever pointing downward above) or a trash can. If the items cannot reach the outside for other players, add a "remove items" button to empty the items out to a chain of hoppers that lead to a public chest/thrift shop, or empties the items to something which destroys them(such as cacti, fire on netherrack, lava, etc.). Attach a hopper to dispenser by sneaking, then place the hopper. This does not work without sneaking. One wise idea is to have entrances to secret rooms in this room.

### Dye room
A nice room where you can store dyes and clay. Typically only has to have one chest, but looks nice with hardened-clay walls.

### Balcony
A nice place to enjoy the view and the nice open air. Also a nice place to pick off those pesky creepers hanging by your front door.

### Incinerator
A room with lava, for disposing of unwanted materials. A good way to do this is to create a two block high corridor with lava at the end, and a slab block just before the lava. This results in you being able to walk up to your incinerator but not into it, eliminating fear of death. Be careful with lava around flammable materials. You may replace the lava with a cactus, or burning netherrack. Hoppers can be used for a "hopper chain," which could lead to a thrift shop, where players can be charged for taking items. Adding this to the incinerator attaches a money source. If the hopper chain is full, items get destroyed.

### Mob farming
See also: Tutorials/Mob farm

A safe, renewable source of gunpowder, arrows, rotten flesh and bones. This makes exploring much safer and can provide the means for large amounts of explosives. Also see Mob Grinder.

### Water elevator
If you live in any building that is more than one story, you might want a method to get up and down easily without stairs or a ladder. One way to do this is to make a waterfall that falls through the center of the structure. Make sure to have one block of space on any side of it so that your character can be outside of the water enough to breathe while climbing it. Simply hold down the jump button (the space bar) while inside the waterfall to ascend. This method can also be used to create an elevator to flying islands or houses.
