### Building with obsidian
Obsidian is a blast-proof block which provides great protection but takes a lot of time to collect. The time requirement for collecting obsidian makes it difficult to use in large quantities. Also, despite the fact that obsidian has a high explosion resistance, it can still be destroyed by blue wither skeleton skulls from the wither. If the player is concerned about protecting valuables from explosions, they do so in an efficient manner to use less obsidian.

In some multiplayer war games, the player may want to build the exterior of their base out of obsidian because most explosions have no effect and it takes time for players to mine into it.

### Non-reusable TNT traps
It is time-consuming to rebuild TNT traps. Instead, the player may want to use a more explosion-resistant material such as obsidian. Even using cobblestone helps, even if it is not fully explosion resistant. The player could instead use water to avoid terrain damage all together as water has the ability to absorb the destructive aspect of an explosion, but not the physics or health damage, which means that the target is still damaged and launched as normal.

### Fire in wood houses
If you want to build using fire in a wooden house, make sure that no flammable materials are nearby, lest you burn down your house. The new campfires can provide the look of flames without a fire hazard, though you still need to be careful not to walk on them.

### Destroying the world spawn point
A player who wants to play with any other items that cause explosions when used, should not do so near the world spawn point. If the player dies after blowing up the world's spawn point and loses the spawn point from a bed or respawn anchor, the player instead spawns at a now-cratered area. This makes it hard for the player to get out, lacking any tools or blocks. To help avoid this, the player may want to mark the world spawn point when starting a new world.

### Living in the wrong biomes
Some biomes are better to live in than others. This also goes for the desert and non-plateau badlands biomes; while both are devoid of trees and generally flat biomes, they are the perfect setting for pyramids and other exotic builds. The swamp and mountains biomes are not recommended as build sites due to slime spawns in the former and extreme heights and few trees in the latter. Also, in mountains biomes, there is also the danger of finding a silverfish block underground disguised as stone or its variants. However, a mountains biome makes a great spot for building an epic house. A water bucket, Feather Falling boots, and elytra are recommended if a player chooses to live in a mountains biome. The snow biomes periodically develop a layer of snow over dwellings, which can be annoying for some, or desirable for others. 

The jungle and dark forest biomes, while full of trees, are hard to build in because of the dense foliage, and can be dangerous to navigate at night. The plains, birch, flower, forest, savanna, giant tree taiga, and taiga biomes are typically recommended for beginner players due to the availability of resources and spawn rates of friendly mobs. Many biome variants and technical biomes are suitable too. See biomes for more. Mushroom biomes are deceptive. No monsters can spawn, and mooshrooms make infinite food sources with bowls, but the player cannot grow trees easily and mobs can still cross over from other biomes. Also, mushroom biomes are rare, making them difficult to find.

#### Extra nighttime dangers of certain biomes
Biomes with more vegetation and hills create greater risks of the player being killed at night as mobs can be hidden behind blocks and the player can become damaged from being knocked off edges. Terrain with lots of water can slow the player, making it hard to run away from some mobs. Deserts and snowy biomes spawn husks and strays respectively, which are much more dangerous than their zombie and skeleton counterparts.

If living in a forested biome, it is a wise idea to clear cut any trees near your base to increase visibility and prevent mobs from hiding under them during the day. Dark forests are especially dangerous, as the extensive shaded areas can shelter many mobs throughout the day.

### Carelessness with wolves
A tamed wolf can be useful as it can give the player a hand when fighting mobs and keep the player company when lonely. It can be easy for the player to forget to make the wolf sit down when not needed, which could prove problematic if the player hits an entity they do not want the wolf to fight. Also, even if sitting, any attack on the player causes the wolf to stand up and come go to its owner. After the player spends enough time with their wolves, the player is less likely to make those mistakes. The player may want a couple of wolves to ensure that they can have a new pet wolf if one dies.

Also, the player should beware of walking on ice, because a wolf teleporting to the player may end up trapped under the ice and drown.

If a player who owns a wolf is farming sheep for wool and wants to keep them alive, make sure the wolf does not teleport to the player while they are inside the enclosure, because wolves attack sheep. Similarly, wolves attack rabbits, so if you have a wolf and a rabbit, make sure to keep the rabbit away from the wolf. And this applies to foxes as well.

### Not having equipment for trips from the base
It is important to be prepared if the player wants to go adventuring. There are a few things that the player should always carry with them when they leave their base:
