#### W - Z
A tall wall made of wood and stone
- WallsAn important part of a city's defenses, keeping both hostile mobs and attacking players out of the city. Walls should be tall and made out of sturdy materials like stone. Walls should have gates which can be closed if the city is attacked. For more tips for constructing walls, seeTutorials/Defense#Walls.

- Water towerA tall building with a tank filled with drinkable water on the top. As water towers are usually tall, it may also have an observation deck at the top.

- Water treatment plantMake all of your city's waste and sewers run into it.

- ZooTry to get one of each mob in a chamber or enclosure where players can look at them. You can make mini-biomes resembling amob's home, perhaps showing off the mob’s natural behavior, such as areas fordolphinsto jump between bodies of water, prey animals forfoxesto pounce on, or flowers forbeesto pollinate. Be careful with  mobs that might despawn or escape and harm players. Also, remember thatspiderscan climb walls and some mobs can teleport. Optionally, you might only put certain kinds of mobs on display.

### Government
Note: If you don't want to have a jail, you can fine citizens who break rules through money or their belongings. Alternatively, you can use a server ban.

### Government buildings

  


Note: Government Buildings are far more useful in Multiplayer, but if you want you can build it in Singleplayer.


- City/town hallHave a huge building for the mayor, the mayor's assistants, and the people in charge of certain things (such as law enforcement, health and welfare, city expansions, etc.) You could even build a huge political complex around it with a secret service headquarters, embassies formobsor other cities or servers, and of course, parking for everyone.

- EmbassiesMake other people's/mobs' voices/sounds heard! Think that pigs have a bad deal being ridden all over the place? Set up an embassy of pigs with otherpiglovers to convince the government to stop the abuse. You could also create embassies for servers or mods.

- ParliamentIf you choose to make your world a democracy, build a Parliament, Congress or National Assembly where player representatives can meet and discuss issues and vote on national issues. Make it unicameral or bicameral. For example, maybe a Chamber of Representatives that is popularly elected on the server and a Chamber of Elders that is elected by player interest groups (For example, "Miners" elect a representative, "Doctors" elect one, "Farmers" elect their own, as well.)

- LegislatureThis is a building that lets different faction leaders and operators discuss and resolve server issues. Have government embassies in each faction base. This is perfect if you have multiple cities as there can be a capital and every city can express their concerns and request aid.

- Treasury/national bankHolds valuable items or currency for the government. This could be similar to Fort Knox. These could also be the warehouses used in the communism system.

- PalaceHere lives the leader, such as the king or president, or server creation, consider taking inspiration from real-world palaces.

### Government systems

  


Note: Government systems are only possible in multiplayer. If you're in singleplayer, these ideas may be useless.


- Democracy
	- A style of government where elections for a leader [Either directly or through the legislature] and a legislative body are held timely.
	- A group of elected players as a legislative body to represents all players and vote for laws and decisions, although in some cases allow players to vote directly instead.
	- A document defines the state and the institutions of government and consists checks and balance in order to protect players from abuse of power of the rulers.
	- An independent judiciary to punish rule-breakers.

- Plutocracy
	- Special privileges to the rich while the poor don't get good treatment
	- If someone has low amounts of money, force them into work.
	- Everything is expensive.
	- If a rich player becomes poor, they join the many other poor in the outskirts of the city where they are then forced into work.
	- In this system a player have to work hard to achieve success.

- Dictatorship/oligarchy
	- There is one player (the owner for example) or a small group that tightly controls all aspects of the state and often bans or tightly controls groups and meetings through harsh laws (such as torture, forced labour, or sent somewhere far away from the city) and secret police that spy on all players.
	- The ruler is worshipped like a god through excessive praising, naming locations after him/her and giant statues of him/herself.
	- Rebellions start frequently in this system.

- Socialism
	- All industry is owned collectively; that could mean by the government, or it could mean communally by groups of players, but nobody works for any private individual.
	- Wealth is collected by the government from the citizens and is spread evenly among the population.
	- There are no classes since nobody is anyone's boss in a company.
	- All land is owned collectively, either by the government or by equal groups of players.
	- Works best in a world rich in resources to facilitate the even spread of commodities to the masses.
	- Leaders in the government or in cooperatives should decide where to build new structures (for example, houses, farms, banks).
	- Leaders can be chosen in any way you want
	- Usually collapses fairly quickly.

- Winner takes all
	- Whoever assassinates the king is the king.
	- Alternatively, it's not a case of whoever kills the last king, it's the case of who's the strongest. For instance, the person with the mostnetheriteequipment could be considered the strongest, but this can also be extended to control of territory, influence over the population, etc. It could also be a group of people rather than just one individual.
	- Might cause anarchy and constant fighting.
	- Leads to totally different governing styles over short periods of time.
	- Lots of people try to hire assassins or even kill the king themselves, so be careful if you are the ruler!

- Total anarchy
	- There is no government and therefore no laws.
	- There is much crime — griefing, trapping, murder, etc.
	- People build and destroy anything wherever and whenever they want.
	- Note: If you felt that you put too much work into your city to have riots, crime, and griefing, this style of government is not ideal.

- Clan battle
	- Have groups together under a clan leader, ideally with clear ways of distinguishing one another.
	- Wage war with the other clans on sight!
	- The clan leader may be dethroned by a stronger one, and battles are held to see who is the strongest.

- Crime city
	- Strictly enforced rules by police and admins.
	- Anyone caught committing a crime is sent to one half of the city, while everyone else lives on the other side of the city. Separated by a wall.
	- Poorer people have to live close to the wall, while higher class people get to live in the nicer part of the city away from the wall.
	- Note: If you felt that you put too much work into your city to have riots, crime, and griefing on one half of it, this style of government is not ideal.

- Feudalism
	- There is a single ruler, they rule everything.
	- They would rule over any number of lords that govern smaller sections. These sections of would be divided into settlements with local governments which rule over one or two villages.

- Anarcho-capitalism
	- There is no government; rather, corporations and individual players make all decisions, and enforce them with privately funded police forces.
	- Taxes are not necessary as no government exists and any typically public development is undertaken by private corporations based on demand and supply.
	- A corporation might be able to exploit its power to harm competing businesses.

- Roman republic
	- There is a group of players (the senate) that make the decisions.
	- The Senate Chooses two players as their leaders (The Consuls) they only serve their position for a fixed term.
	- If the city is in a crisis The Senate and The Consuls can choose a dictator, he serves only until the crisis is resolved, he has absolute power.

- Syndicalism
	- A potentially more workable way of anarchy.
	- No central government, no banks, no money (players have to find a way to trade!).
	- The economy is run by a council consisting of players representing every part of the economy (potions, farming,cobblestone, etc.); these council members are democratically chosen and represent their industry's workers, but have no more power than the average member of the community.
	- No one "owns" any land, not even the council members. Since there is no government, there's no police force to protect private property.
	- There are no laws. However, banning is still an option in case of hacking, etc.
	- If anyone doesn't like the city, they can just leave, since there is no government.
	- Do anything possible to make sure that no one player has more influence than any other (no social or economic hierarchy), but always have the ban hammer at hand to keep things from getting out of control.

- Theocracy
	- A form of government in which a god or deity is recognized as the state's supreme civil ruler. Since said god or deity is usually absent from decision making, a self-appointed or elected leader or leaders of the religion of said god or deity rules instead through the personal interpretation of the laws commanded by the god in that religion's written law.
	- You could use real gods or deities, or make up your own! (Example: make the citizens believe in ancient religions, or worshippingNotchas a god).

- Containment
	- Useful if your country is in anarchy or high unrest. There are several "safe zones" in the city/country.
	- The safe zones are controlled by the police and/or army.
	- If you want, you can quarantine them. This means making it impossible or hard to get in or out.
	- The places which are not safe zones, are anarchy, (civil) war, apocalypse, etc.
	- Those are not controlled by the government and you can do whatever you want there.

If you can think other systems of government, feel free to put them here! (Tip: Put the suggestions above this line, not beneath it.)
