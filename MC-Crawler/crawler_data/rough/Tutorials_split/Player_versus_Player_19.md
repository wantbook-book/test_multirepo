### Basic PvP supply setup
The following is a step-by-step tutorial on how to survive while being new to a PvP server. Follow in this order:

- Go solo for now. If the server you play on has Factions, make one to protect your stuff. Be sure to walk at least 5500 blocks. Using a boat is a good idea as you do not need food and can travel at night.
- Go in the opposite direction people are moving toward. This prevents you from being noticed.
- Make sure it is far away from anything. There's nothing more horrifying than your mortal enemies being your next-door neighbors.
- Make a small, undetectable base. Underground is the least noticeable around layer 10 is ideal, putting you near good materials and hiding your nameplate on the surface.
- Cheating is something that undermines every setup. Step carefully!

- Start gathering immediately. Do them in this order;
- Find a village to set up your base. Move all the villagers deep underground so that other players cannot find your base.
- Make a farmer villager to sell bread and buy pumpkins.
- Set up a pumpkin farm or a melon farm. This will supply you with emeralds to buy items from the villagers.
- Make an Armorsmith, Weaponsmith, and Cleric to buy armor, weapons, ender pearls, and XP bottles.
- Make Librarians to sell you Protection, Mending, Unbreaking, and Sharpness books. These are the minimum enchantments youll need.
- -Make a portal tothe Netherin order to findblazesandnether wart.
- -Once you have a blaze rod or two, start hunting forEndermen.
- -Make anender chest.
- -Start brewing potions.

Tip: You must have a fallback in your base in the case of hard times. This means:

- A renewable source of food,
- A renewable source of wood, and
- A set of stone tools to restart the gathering of supplies.
- Hopefully a good pickaxe to mine resources.
- Backup emeralds to buy new gear.

- To make raids against you rare, it is recommended to live in the Nether (but not the End since it's highly coveted) where people normally don't go. It's dangerous, but not as dangerous as living in the overworld. Keep in mind, if you have a mining base, that too must be defended since raiders can get there via the portal.

- Make a faction and start recruiting.

-Note to do this when only a few people are online to make sure that nobody else is there to make you enemy (if you're lucky).
(Factions is a Bukkit plugin and is not part of a vanilla server.)

That's it! Not too long ahead, you should become good enough to last through most attacks... eventually.

## Getting loot quickly
A lot of times in single player survival Minecraft, you are going to need something. In factions, you are going to need it a lot more because you are competing with other people for it. Some ways to get it faster:

- selling- in many faction servers you can sell, auction, and buy stuff. Check and see what you can sell. Most Faction servers allow you to sell cobblestone and dirt, quick ways of getting money.

- Teleport killing- In the chat bar you see a new player and you want to take their stuff. They don't have any faction, so you tell them "Teleport to me and you can join my faction" as soon as they arrive mercilessly slaughter them. (Note that this can create a bad image for you on the server and could potentially get you banned, so only do this on servers that this is allowed or you don't value).

- glitching- use certain glitches to your advantage such as item duplication, again avoid the possible banning

## PvP itself-the foreground
### Lag creates opportunities
Despite lag making people randomly visually act, cause injury because of damage just showing up, and crash the server, it may still be useful instead of a nuisance if you know how to control it to your advantage. Whenever you hit someone under the effects of a lag spike, there is a chance that they won't be hurt and can escape. You can use this time to run when a lag spike comes, therefore you may escape if necessary. Keep in mind, lag also delays redstone machinery, meaning if there's a staircase that only activates when you're on a pressure plate, you can get up easier.

### Good philosophy for fights
** "Only the dead have seen the end of war." **
There is that one case of being Left for Green. This means that your squad disbanded, you are out, all alone with maybe a few enemies a kilometer or two behind you looking for you, and you're starving. Be independent. What if nobody is there stupid to help you? What if your leader takes all the valuables and leaves their troops out to die? You must gather resources, get help of any kind, whether it be a lone man just with a stone toolkit or a juggernaut in Protection IV armor, and you must be careful and start your own faction. Tip: Since anyone can be boughtâ€¦eventually, keep your own secret, hidden, well guarded bases. Never tell anyone about it. It is for you and only you.

** Watch videos and tutorials on how to build traps (or other PVP tactics), and be smart with what you learned. Many people know how to make traps. That is good on one hand, but on another, they might not know how to use their knowledge to their advantage. Combine traps and improvise offline. **
** Don't overkill yourself. Think first before charging ahead to do something. Think first of the necessities, which are supplies, and deal with the secondary needs after. **
** Don't be scared to act like a coward. If you stand no chance, save what you can save and run! If you're nearly killed, and have no hope of victory? Run! And don't let yourself be lured into 1-on-1 PvP unless you can win! **
Use your mind over your in-game muscles! Preferably, use both! Most important is to use your environment wisely. For example: if you're in a jungle biome, run into the trees and attack your enemies! If you're in a big NPC-village with iron golems: make your foe hit the Iron Golem, then run off and snipe the foe! If you're on a small island in an ocean biome: get a boat, sail a little away, and use your bow to take down that diamond-armor juggernaut! While in the Nether, surprise the enemy with a bed and kill them with the explosion! While in The End, spleef your enemy into the void for a sure victory! It will all be yours if you succeed! Your sword might be a strong weapon, but your bow is even stronger if you use your mind. Also, don't be scared to use potions: they can give you a great advantage over your non-potion using enemies.
** Evaluate your position. In other words, take into account all your advantages, all their advantages, and weigh the options. Sometimes, you need to guess and check. The most important ones are your advantages or disadvantages in **
1. Armor and armor enchants
2. Swords and sword Enchants
3. Bows and bow Enchants
4. Ender pearl or portal availability
5. Potions, skill, and hunger

The most iffy is skill. Some people are so good with their timing that they can calmly mine and take their diamond ore, then swing around and shoot just as soon as you are within a block of them!

In fact, who says you need better equipment to win? Let's say that your base is in the sky with a public chest containing some equipment. Then, all of a sudden, you come down with one teammate and realize that the base is being raided! In the chest, you find some string and cobblestone. The enemies are in iron armor, but enchantments are unknown due to this being before the 1.3 update. Now, if the raider's armor was not enchanted, then you're in luck. A stone sword against iron armor with no buffs deals a full heart of damage. A fully charged bow does about as much damage as a diamond sword. Even if you have no armor, you still somewhat stand a chance against those two since it's you and your teammate fighting them. You do not need to be the same size as long as you can beat them. If you and your teammate are strategic, let's say they stick together, and your enemy doesn't, then you are almost guaranteed to kill them, that is if both of you have at least stone swords and they are alone with an iron sword and full iron armor. If you got lucky enough to mine a diamond sword, bring that out too: if you can, enchant with even just Sharpness I, which will do about 5 hearts every hit. If you somehow have gotten a Strength II potion, maybe by buying it on a server, then DRINK IT! It will multiply your damage by 3.6, so that 5, if you make that a critical hit (by falling when attacking) (will do 7 hearts) WITH Strength II, then you just might have killed your opponent in one or two hits.

** Get to your senses. **
You may be thinking that people who have lost so much that their anger is uncontrollable are going to go psycho to win and when people come with supreme equipment you should be scared out of your wits, since that "causes" adrenaline. No! Anger and fear are both factors to defeat. When either happens, whether it be an attempt to kill a player who has diamond armor with your fists or combat logging just because you are so scared that you have to go to the bathroom of fear of peeing in your pants, you will most likely forget all the tips you have learned until you get back to your senses. Avoid that. Now, you must stay calm. Run for cover, and don't stop to watch the deaths of your teammates. If you have one, drink a Potion of Swiftness (the second tier is highly recommended), and keep running. Do not turn back, do not look back, do think of what's back there, and do not stop. Just keep running until you reach safety, whether it be allied or peaceful territory, or a secret place. Don't stop. Stay sharp.

** Peace, dude. **
Remember what's been said about not trusting anyone? Your turn to chip in to take a stab at backstabbing. Create peaceful factions for your team. Their only purpose is to earn supplies while being impossible to touch.

** Diamonds aren't the key to victory. **
If two players in diamond with enchantments come and raid your base, and you're 4 people in iron, and only you have a full set of diamond equipment, do not bring it out! It is obvious you don't stand much chance as you are overpowered. You do, however, need to keep potions. They should consist of the following:

Poison+Speed+Strength
Also, keep flint and steel, along with fire aspect swords and bows, along with you. And if you find generation errors that create gateways to the Void, use them. Don't forget to keep your dispensers loaded and ready to fire with arrows, damage splash potions, and fire charges. The reason why this equipment and these traps can beat people in diamond is because they go right through their armor. Nothing, not even diamond armor, can resist their effects (except for arrows. Fire, potion effects and Void damage are the only lethal things unaffected no matter what kind of armor.). Also, a potion of invisibility will mean no one will know where you are attacking from!

Also, remember the gift of decoys. Say you have nothing at all and you were just a player that started in a faction war faction. Use your expendable condition. Say there is a hall of traps designed by a redstone scientist. Throw yourself at the traps, run like a madman, break those hidden redstone clocks, and just kill your player on those lethal traps so your faction can zip in and break a hole in their obsidian shield. To victory!

** In and out **
On some servers, the PVP can take place in real life, as well. If you have many friends who play Minecraft, you can call them to join your (allied) faction, which will make strength in numbers. If one of your friends is good at persuading or knows a lot about strategy, that's even better! Also, if you know your in-game enemy well in real life, you can somehow reduce the time they can play or have a talk with them, so they may have a change of heart.

** Attack his weak point **
No matter how your opponent fights, they are bound to have some kind of weakness. Wastefully attacking where they are well defended won't work, and you will usually have to change your plan accordingly. Is he not using a shield? Abuse yours extra hard by blocking all his hits. Debuffing you with splash potions? Chug some milk. Shielding your arrows and tridents? Whip out the Piercing enchantment. Not even the heavily-geared Netherite player is invincible: you can bypass his armor with splash potions and tipped arrows. This also brings to the next point:

** Be one step ahead of your foe **
Just as you adapt to your opponent's tactics, your opponent will adapt to your tactics. If you see your opponent change his actions, think about why he is doing that. Don't rashly play into his hands. If your opponent just placed blocks to stop you from shooting him, stop shooting him and attack up close. Just as your opponent counters your actions, you need to counter his actions. Your plan of bypassing his Protection IV Netherite Armor with tipped arrows may be a sound plan, but if he starts holding down his shield, you'll have to change. If you, say, start shooting with your Piercing Crossbow then you're golden. As long as you are devising and implementing counters to your opponent's counterplay, then until your opponent figures out what to do in response, you have the advantage and you should press it. The longer one plays reactively rather than proactively, the more of a disadvantage they are at.
