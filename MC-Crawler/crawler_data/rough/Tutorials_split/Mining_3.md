## Shaft Mining
Also known as Vertical Mining, Strip Mining, or Shafting, Shaft Mining consists of digging the player's own tunnels to expose hidden resources. The usual warning for digging applies: Watch out for uncorking lava or water or for digging into a deep drop or inhabited cavern. While doing this, make sure to be careful as the player might remove a block holding back lava or separating them from a drop or hostile mobs.

The best way to mine is to dig 3 blocks forward and dig 5 blocks to either side. Alternatively, you can get 2 trapdoors and use the dive mining method.

### Simple Mine Shaft
A simple mineshaft is a 3-by-3 or 4-by-4 shaft that has a ladder on the side. The player can build several bases in the middle by making a glass floor and expanding the resulting room. The following diagrams show what one looks like:

### Staircases
A staircase mine.
The advantage of a staircase is that the player can always trivially climb back up, without need to place ladders. Crafting some of the harvested stone into stairs makes getting down and up even easier without jumping, though they need to carve out an extra block of headroom. Any such staircase drops at most 1 block for each 3 blocks excavated (without the headroom). There are several sorts possible:

#### Straight Staircases
A straight staircase heads down, but also over. This may or may not be useful — with a map, the player might learn about more of the surface they are going ‘’under’’, but if they need to dig their way back up a different way, they may come out in unknown territory. Also, a long staircase from their base may take them out of chunk-update range from their base, or at least far enough out that further exploration will take them out of range. Then their crops won't grow and so forth while they are mining. All of these can be 1, 2, or even 3 blocks wide.

The most basic strategy is to mine in a straight line at a 45° angle downwards, moving one block across for every block down. If the player dig out four blocks above each step instead of three, climbing back up is easier, since they won't "hit their head" with each jump up the steps. Placing a torch every fifth block helps the player keeping track of their elevation, and maintain a decent light level.

Alternatively, the player can dig diagonally. Face a corner, and imagine that the corner block is the missing block of a 2×2×2 cube. Now dig that cube. Repeat, adding torches at every step. This takes more effort for each level dropped, but exposes more blocks along the way.

They can also dig a shallower stair, two blocks ahead for each block down. This takes the player even farther away horizontally, but makes it much easier to run minecart trains up the stair.

#### Spiral
Spiral staircases are slightly more complicated since they have frequent turns, but have the advantage of leading straight down, thus staying in the same chunk. This gives the player a more targeted dig, and can often reach bedrock quicker and more safely than straight staircases.

##### 
Starting from a flat floor, dig one block ahead of the player, then dig 2 blocks down to the right of that. Then move forward into the first place they have dug, turn right to face the second step, and to its right dig 3 blocks down from the floor. The fourth step puts them below their original floor — leave the floor block to become a ceiling, and dig the three blocks below it down to the new step. Continue with this pattern, note that each turn of the stair becomes the ceiling for the next turn. This design drops 4 layers per full turn, but if they run into gravel, players need to place dirt or cobblestone to replace it for the stairway. Turning right forms a clockwise spiral, they can of course go the other way for a counter-clockwise stair.

##### 
One design is a 3×3 horizontal grid. By digging one block down at a time, and moving around the perimeter of the 3×3 area, they leave enough head room as they move down the staircase. They can also add stair blocks to this setup as well. They can optionally leave the central column for a barrier, or mine it out to place ladders for speedy transit. Instead of ladders, they could use a waterfall, but they had have to place that after "finishing" the stair (dig an extra pit beneath the bottom of the column to prevent flooding). Players will also have to dodge out of the water column occasionally to breathe. For a long stair, the player will need 2 or 3 blocks deep water. Alternatively, they can remove the central column of the staircase when players finish, and flood the bottom so they can jump to it and save time going down.

The basic design drops 8 layers per full turn. They could build this as a shallower stair (4 layers per turn) for minecarts, but minecarts have trouble with the corners anyway, because of the rock around them. 

##### 
The 4×4 spiral staircase aims to expose as many blocks with the smallest spiral width. It is efficient because it exposes 20 blocks and misses 0 in the central column per layer, while the 5×5 spiral exposes 28 and misses 1 block per layer. Players can dig a 4×4 square and dig one block down as they move around the perimeter. Unfortunately, the 4×4 design does not have a central column that can effectively act as a water column, but 1 or 2 columns can be broken to accommodate ladders.
