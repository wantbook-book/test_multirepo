Obtain a Sniffer Egg

Requirements: Have a sniffer egg in your inventory.

First two sniffer eggs on any Survival world must be brushed from suspicious sand in warm ocean ruins. Any suspicious sand block in a warm ocean ruin has 6.7% chance to contain a sniffer egg. 

If you play on multiplayer, you can also get the advancement by breeding two sniffers that someone else got earlier. Sniffers breed with torchflower seeds and the egg is dropped on the ground after breeding, unlike the turtle egg, which gets placed in the world.

As soon as you get the sniffer egg in your inventory, you will be rewarded the advancement. 

This is a hidden advancement, meaning that it can only be viewed when the player has completed the advancement.

## A Seedy Place
Plant a seed and watch it grow

Requirements: Plant any type of seed.

Plant one of seven types of seeds:

- Beetroot
- Melon
- Nether Wart
- Pumpkin
- Wheat
- Torchflower
- Pitcher.

Six of these can be planted by using them on farmland. The only exception is nether wart, which must be planted on soul sand.

Wheat seeds are the easiest to acquire—they sometimes drop from punching short grass or tall grass. The advancement is given as soon as the seed is planted, you do not have to wait for it to grow.

Apply Honeycomb to a Copper block!

Requirements: Use a honeycomb on any copper block.

First, you need a honeycomb. Locate a beehive or bee nest with honey (see Bee Our Guest above). A campfire placed underneath it is not necessary, but recommended, so that the bees will not get angry. Then, get a pair of shears. They can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Iron Ingot  |                 |

Shears can also be bought from shepherd villagers.

Use shears on the beehive filled with honey (texture change and honey particles dripping indicate that). You will acquire 3 honeycombs.

Next, you will need to get a block of copper, crafted like so:

| Ingredients  | Crafting recipe |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Copper Ingot |                 |

Copper ore can be found most often generating at Y level 47 to 48. When mining it, remember to use a pickaxe better than wooden, the ore will drop either raw copper or itself (the latter will only drop if you're using Silk Touch). Smelting either raw copper or copper ore will result in a copper ingot. Alternatively, you can get copper ingots rarely from drowned drops.

Place the block of copper down, and use the honeycomb on the block of copper. You will then get the advancement. Even if you already had a block of copper placed before and it oxidized, it will work.

## Wax Off
Scrape Wax off of a Copper block!

Requirements: Use an axe to revert any waxed copper block.

Refer to the Wax On advancement tutorial to see how to obtain a waxed block of copper.

Once you have obtained the block, place it down and use any type of axe on it. As soon as you do that, the wax layer will be stripped off the block, and you will be awarded the advancement. Note that this does not have to be the same block that you got the Wax On advancement from.

## Two by Two
Breed all the animals!

Requirements: Breed a pair of all 24 types of mobs that are possible to breed.

Breed at least a pair of every breedable mob, except trader llama, in any order.

To breed a pair of mobs, they must be within few blocks of each other, and you must use both of them with a specific item. You can lure mobs by holding the item they want in your hand. Leads may also help with that, in case of most mobs. There are 25‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80] types of mobs on the list: most of them require a different item to breed, and sometimes additional requirements must be met. Full list of these mobs, items, requirements and methods is in the table below.

Note that any two mobs of the same species can breed with each other, as all Minecraft mobs are single-sex. Also, different variant of the same mob species can breed just fine (e.g. brown mooshroom and red mushroom, aggressive panda and playful panda, etc.). In case of mobs that lay eggs (sniffers, frogs and turtles), note that you do not have to wait until the egg that they laid hatches.

Additional notes:

- As trader llamas don't count as llamas, they are not required to breed for this advancement. However, theycanbe bred forThe Parrots and the Bats.
- Breedingvillagersis also not required, as that is not an event that the player can cause directly.
- Other mobs with baby variants, such aspolar bearsorpiglins, can't breed in the first place.
- Allayandshulkerduplication is not counted as breeding.

A way to check which mobs a player has bred is introduced in the "Adventuring Time" section, which also applies to this advancement; the only difference is that the entry to look for is minecraft:husbandry/bred_all_animals.

As soon as the last pair of mobs is bred, you will get the advancement. Completing it will reward the player 100 experience.
