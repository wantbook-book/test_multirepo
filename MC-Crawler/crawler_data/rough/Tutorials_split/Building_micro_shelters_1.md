### Materials

| Hoe            | 1      |
| Wheat Seeds    | 2      |

At the bare minimum—using a hoe, dirt walls, and slabs—this will take the following raw materials:

|------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    |       | Place 2 blocks, and put a bed on top. Break the blocks, but leave the bed floating.                                                                                                                   |
| 2    |       | Dig a hole one block deep along one side of the bed. Fill the hole with water. Use the hoe on the dirt under the bed. (If the squares aren't dirt or grass, dig them out and replace them with dirt.) |
| 3    |       | Build walls, two-high around the bed, with gaps as follows: Don't block over the water yet, and also leave one space for a doorway at the head of the bed (opposite the water).                       |
| 4    |       | Place blocks over, but not inside of the water. Place only the one layer, not a full wall.                                                                                                            |
| 5    |       | Place the chests on top of the new blocks.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 6    |       | Break the two blocks above the head of the bed, and fill the space with the crafting table and furnace.                                                                                               |
| 7    |       | Place a door where the yellow block is. Make sure to place from theinside.                                                                                                                            |
| 8    |       | Place the torch on the last free block inside.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 9    |       | Put slabs across the top as the roof. Plant your seeds on the farmland inside.                                                                                                                        |

Mini shelters are slightly larger shelters that provides an extra anvil and some space, finally! You do spawn on the roof, but it is safe to jump off.

| 1    |       | Create a two block high enclosure like so.                                                                                    |
| 2    |       | Put a floating bed like so, by putting two blocks on top of floor, then putting a bed on, finally breaking the two blocks up. |
| 3    |       | Go behind the wall and dig under the wall, then fill with water to hydrate the farmland.                                      |
