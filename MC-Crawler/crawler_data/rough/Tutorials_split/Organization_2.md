### Hotbar layout suggestion
| Slot | Item                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 1    | Sword                     | The 1 key on the keyboard is usually the easiest key to reach and is right next to yourpickaxeif you run into a mob or player while mining. It might also make sense to put it in slot 2 to be closer to your "W" finger.        |
| 2    | Pickaxe                   | Works well with the sword if you are fighting and need to tunnel away.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 3    | Shovel                    | Near the pickaxe and sword.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 4    | Axe                       | For cutting down trees and emergency fighting, as axes are slower to recharge than swords. If you don't need an axe, putarrowsto know how many more you have for shooting, or a specialized pickaxe, such asFortuneorSilk Touch. |
| 5    | Bow                       | For shooting mobs, players, or woodenbuttonsorPressure Plate.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 6    | Cobblestone               | There really is no excuse not to use this for building pillars, emergency walls, building, unless you also haveend stone, which is more resistant toTNT. Also good for miscellaneous things such as amapif exploring.            |
| 7    | Water Bucket              | For when you fall into lava, fire, or askeletonor a player with theFlame-enchanted Bow. Also gets anendermanto move away by hurting it. Useful for scaling cliffs and preventing fall damage as well.                            |
| 8    | Food                      | Extremely convenient when fleeing battle as it is only two mouse scrolls from your sword. Or can be aclock, to time those battles.                                                                                               |
| 9    | Torches,Potions, or empty | For things you pick up.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Instant hotbar access suggestion
This layout is designed for instant access to items you might need quickly, and places items with a similar purpose next to each other so they can be accessed with a single scroll. It is also very flexible and has several slots that can be changed without sacrificing the functionality of the layout.

| Slot | Item                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Pickaxe                                   | This layout places your pickaxe next to your shovel and torches (the other most common things you need when mining or caving).                                                                                               |
| 2    | Shovel                                    | It is wise to replace this with a fire resistance potion when traveling to the nether because you won't need a shovel there unless you are collecting soul sand, and because it is easy to reach in case you fall into lava. |
| 3    | Sword                                     | Slot 3 is the easiest to reach with your index finger while backing up with your middle finger. This strategy is efficient when you encounter mobs by surprise.                                                              |
| 4    | Dirt,Cobblestone, or another solid block. | Also easy to reach for emergency situations like a lava flow and very convenient for normal use.                                                                                                                             |
| 5    | Bow                                       | Relatively close to your sword, but out of the way. Bows work best when you are probably several blocks away and not in immediate danger.                                                                                    |
| 6    | Water Bucket                              | Great for when caving or mining near bedrock to take care of lava.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 7    | Potions                                   | This can be anything you might need for the task at hand.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 8    | Food                                      | Important to have on the bar, but out of the way. It may be beneficial to put it in your off-hand to save space for something else.                                                                                          |
| 9    | Torches                                   | One scroll away from your pickaxe for easy access while mining.                                                                                                                                                              |
