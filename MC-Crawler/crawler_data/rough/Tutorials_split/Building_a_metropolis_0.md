# Tutorials/Building a metropolis
A metropolis or a city is a complete urban area with buildings and a dense population. As a project, players may find building a metropolis of their own to be an outstanding project, though it should be remembered that building a metropolis requires using a large number of resources and a lot of time.

This tutorial should only be a reference, not a step-by-step lecture. You should make up your own ideas along the way. This tutorial is aimed for fantasy, medieval and modern buildings, feel free to find the tone that fits better for your world or multiplayer modded server.

## Preparation

Before starting a metropolis, the player should decide on their project's theme, limitations, goals and tools. If the player needs help with finding a theme, suggestions are given later. For some players, building a metropolis in Survival mode may be the most rewarding. Others may want to work on the project in Creative mode so they do not have to spend time gathering resources. To make building quicker and easier, the player may also want help in their project in the form of friends, commands and structure blocks or even third-party programs. Plans also have to account for what the project's future use is, who would view it and the needs of those viewers.

For most themes, the easiest location to build would be somewhere that is generally flat as it removes the need to clear-out large areas. Such an area can be found through a variety of ways including finding a generally-flat biome (such as plains and oceans) or loading a different world type such as superflat or buffet. The player could also use a third-party program such as WorldEdit, MCEdit, VoxelSniper, and WorldPainter to clear an area. The theme may work best in specific biome and the terrain generations, and as such, the player should to consider those things while finding/preparing an area.

If the player plans on building their project in Survival mode, they should ensure they have the basic materials they need to keep the project going, such as good tools and armor, food, and perhaps even a beacon or scaffolding. The player also needs methods to collect all the blocks they need for building their project. As such, they may want to try using more common blocks.

## Getting started
The player should start planning out where a couple of large features of the city should go before they begin building. Then they can ensure they and any other players can begin building the structures. Your first buildings likely end up near the center of the metropolis.

Before building, it's best for you to know what blocks to use in your theme. A project usually looks better if built with blocks that work well together. The best blocks to use together vary throughout the build, but generally the block types used gradually shift from area to area. Lighting should be remembered throughout the build. Building interiors are something the player may want to work as well. If the metropolis is used for a multiplayer world or custom map, the player probably should be careful to not use blocks in their builds which players can easily break or grief. Also, you should plan for the residents of their town. The needs of villagers are different than those of a couple of friends.

The player may also want to avoid overusing rare and hard to acquire blocks such as emerald, gold, and diamond since they work best as attention draws to areas such as spires, corners, or doors and not for main building materials. Making large areas of these blocks make a build too shiny and overwhelming, and lacking in variety.

### City plan
Before you create your city, you should make a city plan. One way to make a city plan is to follow these steps:

1. Firstly, consider the layout. It is easier to make a grid, but some city styles may need other shapes - many cities in real life grew up over time and thus feature an irregular layout. Irregular shapes, particularly round ones, may be challenging to create in Minecraft, but can really add to the variety in your city - there exist online circle generators for creating curved shapes in Minecraft, and you can develop techniques for replicating certain shapes. See the building tutorials.
2.

2. Then you can draw the shapes of your areas or districts. These can be zoned differently, like by having residential districts, commercial districts, industrial districts, etc. Cities in real life frequently divide districts further: for instance, a residential district might have rows of terraced houses in one place and semi-detached houses in another. Cities may also organise themselves based on the people in them - for instance, many have "wealthy" areas and "poor" areas in different places. Keep in mind that districts don't have to be cleanly sectioned off; sometimes they bleed into each other, feel free to make the lines between them fuzzy and gradual.

7. Next, start filling in the sections with the things you want to put there according to the district, the inhabitants, and anything else you might want to consider (for instance, larger houses in more wealthy areas). It is recommended to only fill in around half the zoned buildings, to leave space for other things, at least at first. You can take into account the influences of an area, e.g. the neighbouring sections, when you design its look.
8. After that, you can fill in the other parts of the city. Buildings like schools may fit nicely in residential areas, according to the needs of the area, and certain kinds of buildings may work well in groups, e.g. a series of technology stores.
9. Then add other more important buildings scattered across the city plan, like big commercial centers, airports, municipalities, stadiums, or anything that comes to your mind. It might be worth constructing an area around these features, as in a real city they'd attract people to the area and exert an influence on the neighbouring community.
10. You can add some big avenues across central locations. Make the things that are in front of the avenue bigger (instead of a house, an edifice, instead of a shop, a market, etc.)
11. Finally, be sure to go through your city to make sure it fits what you're going for and feels natural. You can work on the finer details here, and change what you feel doesn't fit.

To start your plan, you can make the outlines with scaffolding, wool, terracotta, concrete, or any other easy-to-collect blocks you have in large quantities. (In Creative mode, your ability to collect blocks is irrelevant.) You can even colour-code it depending on what the outline represents.

Note: To make organising your ideas easier, you can sketch out the city plan, visualise it in your head, or even model it before trying to make it fit into Minecraft.
