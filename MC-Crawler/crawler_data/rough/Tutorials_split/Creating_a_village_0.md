# Tutorials/Creating a village
Villagers are useful passive mobs. Players can get items that are normally hard to obtain (like enchanted diamond armor) or downright impossible (bottle o' enchanting) via trading with villagers using emeralds as currency. However, finding a village with live villagers can sometimes be difficult, but there is a simple solution: make your own village.

## Housing
A villager needs a house to stay in and be sheltered from threats such as illagers and zombies, which attack villagers on sight. Below are a few houses that you can make for them. Please note that as of 1.14, villagers consider a bed to be a house.

### Simple
This is for those who want the villagers to start breeding, or are low on supplies.

** Materials **
- 1bed

** Procedure **
1. Place a bed.
2. Make sure it is not obstructed.
3. Wait for a villager to come and sleep.

### Hut
See also: Village/Structure/Blueprints

** Materials **
- 59planks
- 3glassblocks orpanes
- 1wooden door
- 20wood
- Torchesorglowstone
- 1 Bed

** Procedure **
1. Dig out a 5×5 area and fill it with 25 planks.
2. Chop out the corners and replace them with wood.
3. Pillar jump 4 times on each corner.
4. Fill in the walls with planks, then replace the block in the middle with the glass.
5. Get rid of the middle and lower blocks. Place the door from the outside.
6. Finish the roof.
7. Light up the inside and outside with torches or glowstone.
8. Place a bed inside.

### Breeding huts
An easy way to make buildings that can make your villagers multiply a lot. They're designed to be practical more than attractive, though.

** Procedure **
1. Place 10beds.
2. Place abellwhere villagers can gather.
3. Place at least onecomposterto make at least one villager adopt the profession of farmer.
4. Dig a hole and fill it with water, then make some farmlands and give the farmer some seeds (wheat or beetroot), potatoes or carrots, so they can plant and harvest crops to share food with other villagers, which makes them willing to breed.
5. Decorate the building if desired.

Another way to do this:

1. Make a 6×6 square, with walls, out of your building material.
2. Place 1 door, then a line of cobblestone, then another door for the entrance.
3. Transform two zombie villagers back into villagers.
4. Place two beds
5. At night, the villagers go inside and sleep (they won't breed if villagers are not willing)

### Trading hall
Skipping to the advanced version, you can make a large building to house (imprison) many villagers for convenient trading.  Entry should be blocked by fence gates or iron doors to prevent escapes, and the entire building needs to be well-lit and otherwise defended from invading monsters; otherwise the design and appearance is up to you.  The core of the trading hall is the series of cubicles where the villagers spend their lives. 

These can be separated by walls, fences or blocks, with a fence-gate for you to get in or let a villager in or out. These need to have at least four blocks of floor space each:  Two for a bed, one for a job site block, and one for the villager to stand. The open space should be between the head of the bed and the fence gate.  Ceilings should be three blocks high to allow iron golems to move around, and allow villagers to breed. You can also add beds to many, if not most Villager rooms in the Trading Hall once you get enough resources. You may also have a "breeding hall" or dorm with several beds, to breed yet-unemployed villagers.  Use fence gates to block off any stairs you may need, and trapdoors to block any ladders.

## Defense
Artificial villages can be attacked by zombie sieges and illager raids too, so you need to establish defenses for them as well, and you can do it before bringing the first villagers there! (note: if you already have an artificial village populated with villagers, refer to regular village defenses)

Firstly, you need to build a wall around the area where you plan to build the artificial village. As the player selects the terrain, and there is no rush, you may incorporate erratic terrain to your liking, but make sure safety accommodations are made for the villagers including lakes/rivers, lava lakes (most important), caves, and two block or more holes/4 or more block drops. Also, make sure you use fence gates to get in and out of the walled area. It is also a good idea to put a block or two out from the top of the wall so spiders can't climb in, so you would be safer.

Next, you need to light up the area inside the village to minimize hostile mob spawning at night. After that, make sure that you placed at least one bell, making sure it has a considerable distance from the wall. Afterward, make sure there are at least 10 beds inside the wall. (It is advised to move the beds inside houses with wooden doors later if they are not already.)

Next, it is time to bring in the villagers. make sure there are at least two, and that you have spawned an iron golem inside (note you can also kidnap iron golems via boats). Next, do some rapid breeding (or bring in more villagers) until there are at least five villagers (more if the enclosure is more than 80 blocks long or wide or tall (only include tall if you use the air for a multi-level village).

After that, you can build the village to your heart's desire, but make sure that additional areas are also walled, and don't tear down the preexisting wall until the new walls are up and the new area is well lit.

You can also spawn iron golems using blocks to defend the villagers from hostile mobs. You can spawn iron golems by placing 4 iron blocks in a T-shape with a carved pumpkin on top. Iron golems spawned this way will not attack the player. Iron golems can also be spawned when a villager is fleeing from a zombie, or when villagers gossip.
