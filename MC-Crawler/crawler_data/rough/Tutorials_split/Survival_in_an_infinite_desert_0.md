# Tutorials/Survival in an infinite desert
This is a tutorial on survival in an infinite desert, whether that's a Buffet world customized with the desert as the only biome, or a Superflat world customized with the Desert Preset, or a Large Biomes world, where you just happened to spawn in the middle of a large desert.

## The challenge of the desert
The desert biome is one of the most difficult biomes for a player to survive and prosper in, owing to an extreme scarcity of essential resources in the natural environment. Typically, no trees are available to make planks for even wooden tools or a crafting table. Without even basic wooden tools there is no obvious way to obtain cobblestone, and so there is no way to enter even the "stone age". Without a crafting table, crafting is extremely limited. Even basic survival becomes a real challenge in a desert, and different approaches are required in order to make actual progress.

If you spawn in a desert biome in a normal game, you probably just need to get somewhere else, fast; check out the Survival section, build a starting shelter, collect materials for travel shelters, and start exploring your way out of the desert, to somewhere more hospitable. This whole Tutorial only really applies if you intend to remain in the Desert biome indefinitely.

If you wish, you can make sure that the bonus chest is on so you get wood and other items.

## Creating a desert world

  

This section needs to be updated. 
Please update this section to reflect recent updates or newly available information.Reason: New customized as of Java Edition 1.16


### Creation: superflat vs buffet
In Java Edition, to create an infinite, endless desert to survive in, simply create a new world, change the world type to Superflat, select "Customize", select "Presets", and choose the preset “Desert”, then Done. Then, create and start the world.

In Java Edition, there is an additional option called Buffet Mode, which can generate a world more like the desert in normal Minecraft games, in which you can more easily mine for ores instead of having to raid villages for minerals or dig down to near the bedrock layer.

Go to Create a new world, change the world type instead to Buffet, then select "Customize", and change the Biome to “Desert” and the Generation type to "Surface". Then click Done and Create, and start the world.

#### Buffet vs superflat comparison
There are some fairly significant differences between the "Superflat" desert preset, and the  "Buffet" desert. The Superflat desert has a limited range of resources (block types, mob types, etc.). The Buffet option allows you to disable Structures such as Villages (for extra challenge).

The Buffet desert has a greater variety of terrain features, including water lakes, and potentially rivers, that don't appear in the Superflat Preset Desert.

### Creation: Bedrock Edition
See also:  § Addons

In Bedrock Edition, you can select any of the world types (Infinite, Flat, or Old) and use seed templates to pick a seed called "Desert Village".

### Edition and version differences
#### Bedrock Edition
See also:  § Addons

In Bedrock Edition, the desert village preset seed is centered on a plains region, albeit surrounded by river, then the desert. Outside of the starting plains region, this world is mostly desert, cut across by river biomes, eventually, become the ocean.

As such it offers an easier challenge because of the availability of trees at the start point, and because of the frequently encountered river biomes. 

There is a discontinued preset seed, Vast Desert Oasis, seed 961601796, but this suffers from the same issue of having trees near the start point.

In summary, Bedrock Edition is not ideally suited for a hard "Desert Survival Challenge". However, the information in this article is still useful for a player who finds themselves in a desert biome or wishes to play this survival challenge by refraining from using the trees or other plains biome resources at the start point. Perhaps you can roleplay that you have been "cast out" from the plains area, empty-handed.
