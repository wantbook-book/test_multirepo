### Picking a Spot
Selecting a spot for this is hard. As previously stated, don't make this thing in an extreme hills or jungle biome. If it's high enough over an ocean, plains, desert, etc.... then it will take a while to notice and often be obscured by clouds. If it's over an extreme hills or jungle, anyone getting materials from a tree or climbing a mountain will look up and see your precious base sitting there. You don't want that. Instead, build it over a valley or a plain or desert. That should help disguise your place. Another idea is to build it over a plains forest, because most players will travel beneath the trees and will not notice the great big shadow on them. Don't build it over forests, though, if the trees are too tall or if they're too sparse, as players could notice the shadow or be high enough to see your base, and don't build it if the trees are too dense because most advanced players will travel above them to avoid monsters and hiding players, and it's a lot easier to walk on, and ultimately see your base.

### Getting Up There
This is pretty hard. You want to get up in the sky. You don't want anyone to know you're in the sky. Your only real option is to pillar up there. But how will you get down? The answer: sethomes.

Most, if not all factions/PvP servers, allow you to set a "home" that you can return to at any time. If this is one of those servers, you can skip the portals and instead type /sethome (or /f sethome to set your whole faction's home), and /home (or /f home) to return to the exact point you used /sethome (or /f sethome) at. Set your home up in the base, and then have a pool of water to fall into right below your base. Then, when you want to get up, just type /home! 

#### 
The answer for you? Nether transport!
First, get enough obsidian and/or molding supplies to make two portals. Next, make sure there's no one in a 100-block radius of your soon-to-be base. Then, pillar up about two hundred blocks: not really necessary, but it's a nice height. Sure, you can't really see the ground, but people will need a LOT of dirt to get up there. After that, make a Nether portal up there. You then want to go about sixty-four blocks away from your location. Make another portal. Go through it, and back in the Overworld, cover it up using dirt or something to make a convincing, small hill. Go back through your portal and make a walkway to easily get between your portals. You may wish to disguise it later, but it's fine for now. Go back through your sky portal and you'll end up on top of your pillar. 

Another good method: Place a torch in an 8-block pit, place cobblestone above the pit, place TNT by the cobble, and put a WOODEN button on the TNT. Build a gravel pillar up. Once you can almost not see the ground, shoot the button and quickly place a cobblestone below you. You should be on a block of cobble 40 blocks in the sky. Repeat until you are at your desired height.
Once you're on top of your pillar with your preferred method of transport in place, build a few blocks off, smash your pillar, and make a small platform.

#### Building of the base
Now you've got a platform. You've got to build off from it to make your base. There are basically two approaches to this:

1. You can go for the walled fort look. It makes pillaring from the side virtually impossible and its boxy shape will make it blend in with the clouds. But, it's more resource-intensive and cannons that shoot TNT upward at high velocities are exceedingly deadly, because, with some aiming, they can shoot right onto your roof or platform. If you go with this method, you may want to consider covering the bottom with wool, snow, quartz or similarly colored blocks to blend in easier with the clouds.
2. You can build a sort of "village" up there, with several separate buildings with no fully surrounding wall. It's not as resource-intensive and is easier to expand. However, pillar raids are much easier than if there was a wall. Also, it's harder to maneuver around and a misstep can find you falling to your death. In addition, it is harder to maneuver and your bridges may cause you to have to take a more convoluted path to get from one place to another. Not to mention, it takes a lot of power to fully claim it.

- A sky village.
- An uncompleted walled sky fortress.

You may want to make a sort of (safety net) above and/or below the platform. This way, if TNT lands on the roof, then it will take extra TNT to get to the actual platform. The one underneath prevents you from falling and dying every time you walk along without paying attention to the terrain.

Another way to prevent getting your base all blown up is to add a liquid shield, preferably water, which is infinite. TNT doesn't destroy blocks while submerged, and water is much easier to obtain than high-end materials like obsidian. However, plugins may change this, and hybrid cannons may become an issue.

Whichever you choose, this kind of base is good because it protects you from your foes BEFORE they see you. Of course, it has weaknesses in the fact that it is tricky to set up in the first place and can be somewhat hard to defend, depending on how you build it.

To make it easier, build murder holes (holes in the floor or ceiling that you can shoot arrows though). You may also want to build a few "outposts" around 50 blocks from the ground. That way, you can kill enemies easily. Beware though; if you build outposts, then it's a dead giveaway that there is a sky base somewhere around, so only build them if you have at least 2 chunks of land in each direction claimed and aren't worried about stealth.

You want to consider whether you value the looks of your base over its defensive capacity. Of course, if you're a gifted architect, you could try both, but remember that construction is difficult.

Add defenses. Build smart, so that anyone trying to ender pearl in will either hit a vertical wall and fall to their death, or land on the roof in a layer of lava. Space out some glass to let a bit of light through, which may help to hide your shadow. Another thing you can do to help disguise your shadow is to build the floor out of glass. Using this is a triple victory, as it is cool to look down on the ground, it hides your shadow, and you can see any enemies pillaring up. Build the lowermost deck in a ring shape so that there is no "blind spot" under your base.
