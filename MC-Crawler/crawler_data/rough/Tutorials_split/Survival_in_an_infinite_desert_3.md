#### Temporary or travel shelters
If you are exploring long-distance and not able to return to your original shelter, or have searched in all directions for one day's (return trip) travel from your original shelter, create new shelters along similar lines. Sand, dirt and cacti are your best building materials, particularly for quick portable shelters when traveling, because they are easy for you to destroy (move back into your inventory) without serious tools.

First a 5×5 (exterior) sand block house, 3 blocks high (solid roof at the 3rd level). Cactus for a door. Then, a 2-deep ditch at least 3 clear blocks distant from the walls. Then, a zigzag cactus ring and then an outer ditch. Or you can make a simple portable shelter with:

- 5×5 block sand walls, 3 blocks high, with empty door spaces 2-high in the middle of each wall (40 blocks total)
- 4×2 cacti for 'doors' (8 cacti, but more is good)
- 10 solid blocks (dirt is most portable) for the roof space (or 8 if you want to leave a 1×1 skylight)
- 4 solid blocks (e.g. dirt) for "lintels" above the doorway spaces (since sand fall down into the space)

Optional:

- 1-high sand block under the skylight, topped with a cactus to prevent endermen visiting.
- 1-high sand block on the roof, topped with a cactus to discourage spiders parking on your roof, and make your shelter more visible from a distance (e.g. on your way back to your main base after exploring.

You can either disassemble this shelter with you in the morning and take it with you, or you can leave it in place to start to create chains of 'waystation' shelters. If you leave it in place, be sure to build a tall pillar with cactus on top near it or on top of it, as a navigational marker.

If you don't have dirt and are using sandstone, since you can't re-use the sandstone, carry multiple lots with you (or craft it each day), and leave each shelter in place. Leaving the shelters in place anyway is a good idea, as it allows you to safely make your return journey to your spawn base, in stages. Watch out for baby zombies.

#### Villages as shelters
While it is tempting to take shelter in a village as soon as you find one, this may not be advisable. Your presence in a village during darkness attracts hostile mobs. Your presence overnight in a large village (10 beds or 20 villagers) draws large scale hostile mob attacks. Even if you survive the attacks, the villagers may not. You cannot afford to endanger the villagers, as they are an invaluable survival resource to you (because of their farming and trading abilities). You need to create a shelter of your own, a safe distance from the village (64 blocks from the village edge), and make careful preparations for the defense of the village before ever spending the night at that village. See more information below under defending villages.

## Combat
In a desert survival situation, you generally want to avoid combat unless absolutely necessary, because you are weak compared to a normal game in almost all relevant ways: weapons, armor, equipment, and ability to recover after death. Even when you do acquire weapons, they are likely to have limited ammunition (arrows) or limited durability.

Your combat style needs to be cautious, defensive, and based on misleading your opponents. The most lethal attack you possess is to maneuver a mob into a fatal fall. The next strongest attack is to smother opponents in the sand, but this requires excellent timing, or you can breach your own defensive barriers. Walls of cacti are less lethal but can be used to channel mobs to a point where you can slowly kill them, doing additional damage as they touch the cacti. Cacti are especially useful against spiders, which are otherwise difficult to keep at bay. A dense roof of cacti (on sand 'pots') is one of the few ways of killing phantoms. 

A shallow trench, 2 blocks deep, around your house can trap mobs, which you can then kill "by hand". But beware of creepers in the trap. These you must kill quickly. Raise a wall two blocks high, behind the creeper, on the outside of your boundary trench, not the inside, and suffocate the creeper with sand blocks so it doesn't explode. Be careful not to accidentally build the creeper a step up out of your trench on your side.

A deeper trench is a killing trap. Lure hostile mobs towards you to get them to fall into it. Chase passive mobs away from you, into the trench. For weak mobs a trench with steps at each end is fine, so you can go in and out to collect loot. But for dangerous mobs who might survive, leave the ends sheer drops, and build stairs down after all mobs are dead.

Create one small gap in your perimeter that you can partly open up to cause mobs to attempt to reach you. This is a choke point, where you can slowly kill them. Construct it with cacti so the mobs take additional damage.

More complex designs—3D choke points—allow you to kill spiders.

Always consider husk babies and zombie babies when designing a defensive killing choke point. These smaller, faster mobs can cross obstacles that other mobs can't.

Always have a secure fall-back refuge area you can retreat to if something goes wrong with your killing ground.
