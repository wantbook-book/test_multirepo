## Try to play older versions

In order to do this, open the launcher and select an older version that you would like to play. There are a lot of older versions of Minecraft you can play. Here are some versions you could try:

- Pre-Classicconsists of the earliest versions ofMinecraft. They are nice and simple, and closely resemble the original "Cave Game" demo.
- Classic
- IndevandInfdev
- AlphaandBetaversions prior toBeta 1.8
- Older full versions ofMinecraftthat you have ever played or not ever played before, to give yourself nostalgia.
	- Beta 1.8andBeta 1.8.1
	- Java Edition 1.0.0toJava Edition 1.7.2
	- Java Edition 1.7.2toJava Edition 1.13
- Development versions of the full release, including snapshots, pre-releases, and release candidates, to explore some bugs you interested.
- The April Fools' versions, such asJava Edition 2.0andJava Edition 20w14∞. See the next section for some ideas.

2.0, 15w14a, 1.RV-Pre1, 3D Shareware v1.34, 20w14∞, 22w13oneBlockAtATime and Java Edition 23w13a_or_b, are Minecraft versions that were created solely for April Fools' Day, containing multiple jokes unique to these versions. Features in 2.0 include silverfish made from redstone (called "redstone bugs" in-game), the pink friendly wither, extinguished torches, and "Etho Slabs," which are essentially slabs of TNT. In 15w14a, the player is unable to directly attack entities, obsidian boats will sink and drown the player, and like in 2.0, the pink wither is present. Features present in 3D shareware include barrels with overpowered items, cheat codes, and various 90s gaming references. 20w14∞ is a version with over two billion dimensions, including several Easter egg dimensions. These April Fools versions can create a fun and interesting experience for players.



## Join a server
Although some servers require online registration, others can be joined at any time without any prerequisites. Numerous activities can be done in servers, such as showing your work to others (buildings, skills, etc.), viewing other people's work, and making friends with the players in the server or just having fun on all types of minigames that servers offer.

## Play a custom map
Custom maps can be fun, and many have a creative storyline, challenging battles, and beautiful buildings. Map time can range from 15 minutes to 100 hours! For those who like to take risks, there are plenty of adventure maps for you to manipulate heroes and fight with countless mobs, and for those who like to take on intellectual challenges, there are plenty of maze maps for you to challenge.

## Make your own map
Various types of maps can be made in Minecraft, including challenge maps, parkour maps, and survival maps, and there are endless ways to build these. Some ideas would include using command blocks or redstone circuits to make a decryption or puzzle map, or using blocks to make a parkour or island map. Sky castles are also great. You can also do pvp maps and play with your friends.

## Upload videos
With software (such as OBS) that allows you to record your screen, videos can be made of Minecraft gameplay. Some common categories of Minecraft videos are Survival Let's Plays, playing custom maps, and building tutorials. These videos can be put up on any website that allows for video uploading; YouTube is the most common of these, but there are alternatives available.

Changing the resource pack won't provide new blocks or items, but it will give Minecraft a fresh look that can be exciting when the first world is created, so you can pick one on the Web and have a look at Minecraft with a new eye.
You can also make your very own resource pack and replace some textures, sounds, subtitles, etc. with yours!

## Try mods
Try mods! Some large ones take time to be fully explored.
There are many Minecraft mods. Try them out slowly. See Curse Forge and Minecraft Forums for details.

## Try Unmanned mining
Install a computer mod (ComputerCraft mod), create "mining turtles" or "advanced" mining turtles, use the built-in mining program (tunnel length). Turtles need fuel, if it can't move, fill in the inventory with coal or other kinds of fuel, type in "refill all" to supplement the fuel. This will make you more secure because they're diamond pickaxes with infinite durability, can instantly dig, and are not afraid of lava or monsters. However, it can't be equipped with an enchanted pickaxe.

## Make mods
Sometimes it's difficult to make a mod (for some people or some types of mod), but you can make the game the way you want it to be, such as a new dimension, some new blocks, and mobs. If you can't program, you can also try to use some visual tools (e.g. MCreator).

You can use Mod Coder Pack (MCP) to modify the source code of the game for versions a1.1.2 up to 1.12.2. If you want to mod for 1.13 and onwards, you can try MCP Reborn. 

If you intend to modify the source code, but you want it is compatible with loader mods, you can try making coremods.  

## Build a railway
If you want to travel around your world in a more scenic route, why not build a railway? It will save tons of food and, at the same time, will be fun to ride on! It could even be useful in transporting mobs like villagers from a village to your base or, if you're a redstone genius, use it to your advantage in your contraptions!
