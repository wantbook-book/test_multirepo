## Instructions for OS X



NoticeÂ 
This guide does not make Minecraft truly portable, as it requires you to copy the game data from and to the portable drive each time you play.


#### Setup
- 
	- Locate your Minecraft files. Press Command+Shift+G while in finder and then paste ~/Library/application support/minecraft into the dialog.
	- Copy that minecraft folder in your application support folder.
	- Insert in your portable drive and make 2 folders in it, named Data and Launcher.
	- Paste your minecraft folder into the "data" folder in the portable drive.
	- Drag your launcher into the "launcher" folder
	- Remove your portable drive

#### Playing
Once you are done setting up, you can test if your Minecraft can start on another Mac.

- 
	- Insert your portable drive into another Mac to test
	- Open the launcher folder and move the Minecraft launcher into your Applications folder.
	- Double click the launcher to run it. Then after Minecraft loads, exit it.
	- Again, go to Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support
	- In "Application Support", delete the minecraft folder.
	- Move the minecraft folder in your data folder on your portable drive to the desktop.
	- Then drag it from your desktop into application support.
	- Run Minecraft again.

Or use this script:

mv ~/Library/Application Support/.minecraft ~/Library/Application Support/.minecraft.bak
cp -a minecraft ~/Library/Application Support/.minecraft
open Minecraft.app
mv minecraft minecraft.bak
cp -a ~/Library/Application Support/.minecraft minecraft
rm -r minecraft.bak
rm -r ~/Library/Application Support/.minecraft
mv ~/Library/Application Support/.minecraft.bak ~/Library/Application Support/.minecraft

## Alternative Methods
WARNING: The following methods will only work in Windows.

### 
Doesn't work, minecraft still runs from the appdata folder, Minecraft Profile Manager is useless, and java will not run from the flash drive.

Instructions

- First, create a folder named, say, "Flash MC".  Then, go on over to getjPortablewhich lets you run Java right on your flash drive, without it being installed on the computer.

- You will want to install that onto your flash drive in a directory like \Flash MC\jPortable.

- Then, go toMinecraft Profile Manager's thread, and download it.
- Put it into your Portable MC folder.  Follow the instructions. (Put minecraft.exe into the same folder that it is in)
- You should now be able to launch MPM, make a profile and download all the needed Minecraft files to play.

### 
Instructions

1. Make two folders namedbinanddata
2. Place the Minecraft client insidebinfolder
3. If you use a .jar it will still be placed in thebinfolder
4. PressWindows+Rto open run and type in the dialog box %appdata% then copy the .minecraft folder (Also include other folders that also included in minecraft such as .aether)
5. Select those folders then pressCtrl+C(orCtrl+Xif you want to move the files rather than copy it)
6. Go into Notepad and copy\paste the following:

SET appdata=%CD%\data
bin\minecraft.exe

- But if you use a Jar, put this instead:

SET appdata=%CD%\data
bin\minecraft.jar

- And if you use a Jar/Exe with a different name such as Minecraft-launcher put this

SET appdata=%CD%\data
bin\<name of launcher>.<jar/exe>

- Then you are all done!

Additional notes

- You will need Java for this, but if you also want java in your Flash/Thumb/USB drive, see the section titledAdd Portable Javabelow.

#### Portable Java Variant
You will need an extra 500MB in your Drive for this to work!

Now you have done the above, time to add portable Java! 

1. Go to [[1]]
2. Then open PortableApps.com_Platform_Setup_11.2.exe then wait until you see the add apps section

Changing the launcher file to use an autorun script

If you are using an autorun.inf instead of using

set appdata=%CD%\data
bin\minecraft.exe

or

set appdata=%CD%\data
bin\minecraft.jar

change the file to this:

set appdata="Minecraft portable\data"
cd "Minecraft portable\drive\"
Minecraft.jar

Save the file as "Autorun.inf" (do NOT save it as Autorun.inf.txt)
