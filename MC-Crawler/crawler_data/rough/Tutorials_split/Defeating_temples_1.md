## Jungle pyramid
### Finding
The dense foliage of jungle biomes tends to block jungle pyramids from sight. The easiest way of clearing the path is to burn the foliage with flint and steel, but you don't want to start a forest fire.

There is also a tool that can find jungle pyramids for you.

The /locate command can also be used and it's explained in the desert pyramid section.

### Entering
A jungle pyramid is made up of 3 floors. The top 2 floors are just entrances, windows, and walkways; all the treasure, puzzles, and traps are on the bottom floor. There is an entrance already made on the 2nd floor, but sometimes it is buried in the ground. 

If the entrance is in plain view, it's usually easiest to enter through the entrance. Otherwise, you can either excavate the entrance, or just bust a hole in the wall and go through that way. If hardly any of the structure is visible, it may be best to go through the roof. It is strongly recommended to enter on the 2nd or 3rd floor and make your way down, so that when you enter the building, arrows shooting at you is not the first thing you must deal with.

Once you've entered, make sure to kill any monsters inside and light up everything with torches. When doing this on the ground floor, be careful not to step on any of the tripwires.

### Puzzle
A reconstruction of the puzzle mechanism. The block of lapis lazuli represents the hidden trapdoor.
In each jungle pyramid, there is a puzzle, composed of a set of levers on the lower level. When the levers are flipped into the correct positions, a block on the middle level of the building is removed from the floor, and a small room with a chest inside is revealed.

| The solution to the puzzle differs depending on which side of the staircase the levers are located. However, because the puzzle is mirror image, the following succession solves the puzzle regardless of orientation:First, flick the lever furthest away from the staircase<br/>Next, flick the lever closest to the staircase<br/>Finally, return the levers to their original positions, first the one closest to the stairs, and second the one furthest from the stairs<br/>Alternatively, breaking through the walls with a pickaxe is an effective method of bypassing the puzzle and taking the loot<br/> |

### Trap
The trap.
When attempting to open the chest, the player must take care not to step on the two tripwires in the middle of the hall. One tripwire is in the middle hall and the other is in front of the chest. It looks like mossy cobblestone, but hidden behind some vines is a dispenser filled with arrows. The dispenser fires when the tripwire is stepped on or broken without shears. If the player can't break it, hugging the wall on the right causes the arrow to fly harmlessly past the player. 

Destroy the tripwires and dispensers to prevent the trap from activating. Grab the arrows in the dispenser. You can also destroy the entire mechanism, which is a good source of redstone in the early game. Take the chest.

Tip: A good way to locate a tripwire is by running your mouse cursor over the floor, and it is highlighted when pointed at.

Tip: When destroying the tripwire arrow trap, destroy the tripwire hooks first before destroying the string to avoid triggering the dispenser to fire.

## Igloo
An igloo.
### Finding
Igloos generate in Snowy Tundra biomes and appear as a roughly spherical mound of snow with ice for windows and an entrance. They may be hard to find because they are made of the same block as the terrain.

The basement of an igloo
### Looting
Inside, there is a Bed, Crafting Table, Furnace, and a Redstone Torch, necessities for starting players. Take those things and place a torch in the igloo to light it up. In 50% of all igloos, there is a basement under the carpet. Dig out the carpet to find the trapdoor. If there is no trapdoor, you can leave. Inside the basement under the trapdoor, there is a cauldron filled 2/3 with water‌[Java Edition  only]/Splash Potion of Weakness‌[Bedrock Edition  only], a Brewing Stand with Splash Potions of Weakness, a chest with basic loot and a Golden Apple, two Villagers (one of them is zombified), and a cobweb for string. If you want to start a village, cure the zombie villager with the available supplies and bring the two villagers to the surface using a bubble column or a spiral staircase, and set up a village for them (more about that here). You can also kill the zombie villager and take the golden apple and potion for yourself if you don't want to start a village. The cauldron also has 2 potions of weakness in it, so bring two glass bottles to get the potions. Be sure to mine the brewing stand, cauldron, and flower pot after raiding, because they are useful later. Remember to use a pickaxe or it drops nothing.
