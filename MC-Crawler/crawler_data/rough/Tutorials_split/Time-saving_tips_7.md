### Planning
If the player is doing anything big or complicated, planning ahead can give enormous benefits. The plan can be as simple as a quick mental checklist, or as ambitious as a full-blown blueprint plus materials requirements. You might also hop into creative mode to test out a section of a build (use a new world if you don't want to turn on cheats). Don't over-plan for a simple project, but don't underestimate the benefits of planning properly for an ambitious one.

## User interface tips
### Exploit the crafting grid
- Some crafting recipes can be made more efficiently depending on how you place the items in the grid. This may save a second or two when making the item, but for frequently-made objects this can still add up. For example, making a gate requires one log block. The most efficient way to make it is as follows:

1. Place one log block anywhere in the grid, and it forms four planks.
2. Hold left-click with the planks in the center of the grid and drag them up one slot to distribute them evenly between the two slots. The crafting output switches from planks to sticks.
3. Click once on the sticks, giving four sticks, and leaving two planks behind in the main grid.
4. Using the method described in step 2, distribute the sticks evenly so that there is one on either side of each of the two planks already in the grid to form the gate.

By placing the planks in the middle of the grid in step 2, they are already in the right place to generate sticks and form the center part of the gate in step 4, which saves you from having to move them. Not many crafting recipes behave in this way, but whenever you make a lot of an item, if you are able to place the ingredients in just the right way you can save a little bit of time every time you craft it.

- Another example for time-saving in crafting is found at the beginning of the game: Making a crafting table and sticks for tools.

1. Take the wooden planks that were converted from logs. Place four in the crafting grid, but don't pick up the crafting table yet.
2. Put four more planks in the crafting grid, but this time two on top of each other, for the stick recipes.
3. This should give you a crafting table and then 8 sticks.

- Similarly, some recipes can be overlapped, so that you can make two different items at once with two quick clicks. You can overlay a shovel (and/or hoe) recipe over that for a pickaxe or axe: stack the extra sticks in place, and add an extra block or ingot at top center (and for a hoe, top-side). When making armor, boots or helmet can likewise be overlaid over pants or chestplate (and/or over each other).

### Right-clicking
Right-clicking with the mouse selects half a stack at a time, or can be used to place a single item in a crafting or smelting slot. Using right-clicks wherever possible helps speed up many crafting recipes from steps and slabs to snowballs, because you can split the stacks into roughly equal portions and convert, for example, a stack of 16 snowballs into four snow blocks with just six clicks. Because crafting is such a big part of the game, making good use of the right-click facility is a big time-saver. Right-clicking on an odd stack gives the higher half, but if you want the lower half, right-click again.

### Shapeless recipes
For a few crafting recipes – such as mushroom stew and item repairs – the way you place the items in the crafting grid doesn't matter. Knowing these recipes saves a little time every time you make them because you know you don't have to place the items just so.

### Shift-clicking
- Shift-clicking makes or moves as many of a stack of an item as possible. Making good use of this trick is probably the biggest time-saver the crafting, brewing, and smelting interfaces provide. It's also useful for quickly filling and emptying chests of stacks of items.
- Double-clicking while holding an item in your hand and holding down shift moves every stack of the item you clicked on, except for the item you are holding in your hand.

### Double-clicking
Double-clicking an item attempts to pick up a full stack of it from the area you double-clicked in, then from other areas if it does not fill the stack. For example, if you double-click on a cobblestone block in your hot bar, it pulls as many as possible from your hotbar, then move on to your inventory, if the stack is not full yet. This is most useful for re-stacking buckets after you have emptied them of water or lava. Just double-click an empty bucket to grab 16 of them at once. You can then put the stack back in the hotbar, then double-click one in your inventory.

### Dropping items
Dropping items from your hotbar while holding down the control key drops the full stack. This also works while in your inventory; hovering your mouse over an item in your inventory and pressing ctrl+q drops the whole stack.

### Video settings
- Lag may arise from a variety of causes, depending on your computer. Possibilities include having too many mobs or items in one place, complex redstone circuits, large forest fires and so on. If the game is normally fast enough for you, but occasionally suffers from lag, don't forget the option of temporarily reducing the game's video settings. Change the render distance to 'Tiny', set particle effects to 'Minimal' and turn off any other video settings that you can live without. When the problem causing lag has cleared, go back to your normal settings. You can also pressF3+Ato reset the chunks. This can help reset the lag.

If the lag is network-related rather than a local problem, these changes don't help much.

If the game is always a bit sluggish on your system, you should use lower-quality video settings most of the time, but don't forget you can temporarily set the quality to high levels for short periods when you want to admire something. (If the lag gets unbearable when you do this, setting the game to peaceful mode at the same time may also be prudent.)
