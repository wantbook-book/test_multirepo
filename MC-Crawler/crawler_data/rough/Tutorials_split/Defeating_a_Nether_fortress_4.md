#### Piglins
Although piglins do not spawn in a nether fortress, you may run into them if the fortress is in a crimson forest or nether wastes. It is advised to wear at least 1 piece of Golden Armor around them. If you really want to, kill them like normal.

#### Zombified Piglins
Don't provoke them, just ignore them so that they leave you alone. They can kill you quickly, or knock you off the fortress bridges. Even better, you could trick a mob with a ranged attack (blazes, skeletons) into shooting a zombified piglin, causing them to retaliate against that mob, and causing a helpful distraction (be careful not to perform a sweep attack on them).

#### Blazes
They spawn from spawners. Kill them with Fire Resistance if you can get the potion/totem of undying. Their ranged attacks will have no effect if you have Fire Resistance. It is possible to kill a blaze without fire resistance. Shoot it with a bow, or knock it back with a sword. Blazes don't take fall damage, but snow and water can damage them.

## Potions
The base components required for all potions (except for Weakness potions) can be found in a nether fortress. Blaze rods are required to craft and fuel a brewing stand, and nether wart is required to make Awkward Potions, the intermediate step to all potions except for Weakness potions. Raid your nether fortress until you find some nether wart, and then mine it and the soul sand under and take it all home. On your way out, kill some blazes if you haven't already to get two blaze rods. Now head back to base, and you can start brewing!

Use one blaze rod to craft a brewing stand, and then craft the other into blaze powder. Take a look into the brewing stand GUI if you haven't already. There are three slots for bottles, an unmarked slot for ingredients, a blaze powder shaped slot, an indicator for fuel, and an indicator for progress on your currently brewing potions. Drop a blaze powder in the blaze powder slot, it should disappear and the fuel indicator will go solid orange. This fuel gets depleted once for every 20-sec operation you do, and a blaze powder has 20 'charges'. Be sure to kill some more blazes later on for more powder to fuel your brewing stand.

Before going further, you'll want to replant your nether wart back at base so you don't run out. Nether warts acts like carrots or potatoes except it only grown on soul sand. If you want to expand your plot you can retrieve more soul sand from the nether. Anyway once you've done that, acquire some glass (smelt sand) and craft three glass bottles. Fill them with water at a nearby water source. Put all three water bottles into the bottom 3 bottle slots in the brewing stand. Put a piece of nether wart into the top unmarked slot. The bubbles indicator will start filling up and resetting and the arrow will slowly fill. Wait 20 seconds while you figure out what potion to brew first. A more comprehensive list can be found at Brewing, but below are some simple potions you should brew (this section will be added shortly). It is highly recommended to get some spare glowstone dust from the Nether, and you should have lots of spare redstone by now. The materials are hard to find sometimes, but making fermented spider eyes will be worth it. Any spare gunpowder can be useful as well.

First and foremost, if you plan to thoroughly loot the nether fortress, close/farm a blaze spawner, or even just be in the Nether, you'll want Potions of Fire Resistance. These wonders will make you immune to fire and lava damage, which includes blaze ranged attacks and magma cubes melee attacks. The potion, sadly, does not defend from a blaze's melee attack. To make these potions, you need magma cream, which is accessible through a number of ways:

- Seen any magma cubes around? Kill one to get 2-3 magma cream. Be prepared to deal with a pack of them as they split up like slimes.
- If you have tons of sparegoldand are playing in a version pre-1.16.2, you can barter withpiglinswhich have a chance of dropping 2-6 magma cream for you.
- In loot chests inbastionsyou can occasionally find magma cream, but especially post-1.16.1 those are better saved for later.
- Combining aslimeballfrom awandering traderor killing aslimewith a blaze powder will make magma cream, but slimes are relatively rare.

If the components are quickly accessible, Fire Resistance potions should be the first you brew. Lengthen then by brewing redstone into the Fire Resistance potions. To keep brewing potions past awkward, you'll want to put all three potions back in their slots if you took them out, and then put the magma cream in and then the redstone after that finished. Voila, you have 24 minutes of Fire Resistance.

Other useful potions can be found in the list below.

- Find the natural regeneration unable to keep up with the fights you get into? ConsiderRegenerationpotions, made withghast tearsdropped by ghasts in the Nether, and enhance then withglowstone dust(fast healing) orredstone dust(heals you for a while)
- Need extremely quick heals between fights and can't wait for Regen to help? UseInstant Healthpotions, made withglistering melon slices(made with gold and melon slices), for this. Glowstone will enhance the effect to more healing.
- Is even sprinting not fast enough for you?Speedis useful. It usessugar, a fairly common find, to give you the speed effect. Enhance it with either glowstone dust (speedy) or redstone dust (speedy for longer)
- Your sword just not doing enough damage?Strengthcan help. It increases your melee damage by 3 health points normally, 6 if enhanced with glowstone dust. Redstone dust can also be used, giving you the extra strength for longer.
- On the flip side, "Corrupted" potions also exist. They inflict harmful effects (likeSlowness,Weakness, andInstant Damageto name a few). Take almost any beneficial potion and brew afermented spider eyein, and the effect will become corrupted. You normally wouldn't want to drink these sorts of things, which is why splash potions exist.
- Splash potionsallow you to inflict harmful effects on your enemies (see above) (or beneficial effects for allies). Brewgunpowderinto any existing potion and now you can throw it. Make sure to throw it far away enough not to effect you when it lands for harmful potions. Make sure to throw it at groups of enemies, as launching it at one would be wasteful.
