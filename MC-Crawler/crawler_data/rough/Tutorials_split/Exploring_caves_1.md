## Exploring tips
### Navigation
Bring a compass.

It is surprisingly easy to get lost in caverns. Below are a number of methods the player can implement while exploring to prevent this, especially trail markers. The navigation tutorial has much more information about markers and other navigation methods. (Summary: Torches, wool, signs, blocks (which can be placed in "arrows", and especially jack o'lanterns.)

One fairly easy marker method is the "torch on the right" rule.  While exploring a cave simply place torches on the right side of the wall as players go deeper in. This way, no matter how complicated and even intertwined the caves get, you can always find their way back because if the torch is on the left of a cave wall, that means they are heading towards the exit. Conversely, if it's on the right, it means they are heading deeper in.

Another tip is to use markings such as colored wool, or other blocks, to find where the player came from. The player can also put signs for further clarification, pointing to the direction in which they came from. Optionally, they can make an arrow shape with the blocks themselves.

Also, a player can place magenta glazed terracotta to place on the wall or floor as it has an arrow pattern on it. This can help show which way is the exit.

While it will not help the player in navigating the cave itself, it may be wise to bring a map with them into a large cave, should the player get lost and need to dig the way out. Note that most caves occupy less area horizontally than they might seem, but interconnected caves and mineshafts can sprawl over huge distances. The player might well map some new surface as the player is exploring underground, but the cave itself will not be mapped.

### Cave survival
Caves can be very dangerous: the light level is dark enough for monsters to spawn; gravel is very common, which could suffocate the player; and the player will see lava often, especially in deeper caves, which can kill the player very quickly and burn dropped items. Here are some tips to help with surviving in caves:

- Remember to always be aware of your surroundings in caves, especially upwards. One of the most common sources of mobs within previously explored caves is unnoticed openings in the ceiling or walls. If the player is in a ravine, watch out for monsters falling off of high ledges.
- A good mining practice is to fully explore and light a cave system before beginning to mine out any resources. It is extremely dangerous to stop and mine in a dark cave, where you can lose your loot if killed. Check for "broken bridges" such as gravel masses or 2-block drops. If monsters can come out of them, you may want to change that; once safety is verified, you can save the blocked-off areas for later.
- As part of exploration, "clean up" the area, taking off leftover blocks, filling small pits, and generally smoothing things out. In mineshafts, you can clear out most of the fence-and-plank "supports" as players "claim" an area.  This will use a lot of axes, but it will improve both visibility and mobility, cutting down on unpleasant surprises. Notably, those fences provide better cover forcreepersthan they do for the player. This will also make it easier to tell where you are.
- Water coming down from above is especially troublesome, as it can carry monsters down from a whole chain of darkened caverns.
	- It's a good idea to swim upwards and light the path of the flow.
	- Most water flows can be captured at the source with abucket; if that doesn't work out, they can be contained with fences or blocks. Either way, be aware of areas where the water flowformerlyblocked monsters. Some flows may be useful to keep for travel â€” the player can swim up or down waterfalls to traverse high cliffs, or land in water to avoid fall damage.  With a little care, you can swim along the outside of the waterfall, which lets the player keep breathing normally.
	- Some water flows from cave ceilings come from openings in the seafloor.  With care (and perhaps adooror someladders), you can swim up these and mark the entrance with ajack-o-lantern, which will generally be visible from the sea surface.  Such openings are also a quick way to get back to the surface if you've gotten lost. With a bit more effort, players can seal the opening altogether, perhaps leaving a shaft with ladders for their own use. (Ladders and signs can be used to block water.)
- Lavaflows and pools can also block the passage. Like water, lava flows can be bucketed if you can reach the source, or contained with blocks otherwise. Lava pools can be flooded with water to convert them toobsidian. Again, be aware of areas where monsterswereblocked by the lava. Also, remember to re-light the area after removing that brightly glowing lava.
- When fighting mobs, be careful of lava as mobs could knock you into it or you might walk into lava by accident and lose your items.
- Using thevolume slidersto your advantage, you can hear creepers relatively easily. By turning the "Hostile Creatures" volume slider to maximum, and setting the "Players" volume to very low, you can hear the footsteps of creepers very easily. Because creepers have the same footstep sounds as the player, by turning down the player's footstep sound, you can be sure that whenever you hear player-like footstep sounds, what you hear is a creeper.
