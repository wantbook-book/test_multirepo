### Deep dark
The deep dark stands out as one of the most dangerous biomes in the game; generating only in the deepstone layer, this biome consists of a unique growth known as the sculk, a family of blocks that include sculk blocks, sculk catalysts, sculk sensors, sculk veins, and sculk shriekers. These blocks generate in small patches around the biome and should be approached cautiously, as if a Sculk Sensor or Shrieker detects a vibration, they alert a dangerous mob, the warden. This formidable creature cannot see, but instead uses vibrations to detect the player, like the Sculk it emerges from. The player must continue sneaking to avoid detection, though beware that the warden also has a keen sense of smell, so remaining motionless is not enough to avoid danger. Carrying projectiles like snowballs is useful for distracting the Warden, but be careful not to anger it by spamming projectiles.

A structure unique to the deep dark, the ancient city, contains powerful and unique loot for the player to grab, but more likely than not the city is covered in sculk. As opening chests causes vibrations, the player must avoid setting off any shriekers while doing so.

#### Pros
- While the warden is a dangerous mob on its own, no other mob can spawn in the deep dark, similar to a mushroom island biome. This means if a player were to put in the effort to remove all shriekers, the biome actually becomes one of the safest in the game to live in permanently. Do note that open areas that connect to other cave biomes can still spawn mobs unless lit up sufficiently.
- Ancient city loot is quite useful, especially if the player were to continue living in the deep dark, as theSwift Sneakenchantment can help the player move around faster while avoiding Shriekers.
- As the deep dark generates in the lower half of the underground, diamonds, gold, redstone, lapis lazuli, and iron are frequently nearby.

#### Cons
- Obviously, it is a dangerous and time-consuming task to remove all the sculk in a deep dark biome. Should the player choose to live among the sculk instead, constant care is required to avoid summoning a warden.
- The danger of the warden cannot be stressed enough; The mob is more than capable of killing players in one hit given they are in early- to mid-level gear, and even endgame gear gains the player only a hit or two more before dying. Killing the warden is not much of an option either, as it has far more health than either of the game's bosses. Its sonic projectile attack also deals a substantial amount of damage, and is capable of traveling through blocks. It is best to avoid the warden, if possible, and should it detect the player, it is best to run away until it can no longer follow.

#### Useful resources
Swift Sneak enchanted books, diamond leggings (possibly enchanted), diamond hoe (possibly enchanted), echo shards, disc fragments, soul fire torches, experience (from destroying sculk blocks), sculk blocks (with silk touch), deepslate blocks, wool blocks, wood, candles from dismantling cities, general underground resources.

## Nether
The Nether contains plenty of valuable resources and is a hospitable place to permanently live, but it is still a dangerous and difficult place to live in. Food is absent in some biomes and hard to come by in others. 

In order to set the player's spawn in this dimension, a respawn anchor can be crafted with crying obsidian (obtained from piglin bartering and bastion remnant chests) and glowstone blocks. More glowstone blocks are required to charge the anchor, with each death taking away one charge, and one glowstone block. 

Blackstone, a stone equivalent that generates in patched within netherrack or basalt, can be used to make stone tools and furnaces. It also has its own set of decorative blocks, such as stairs, slabs, etc.

A rare ore, ancient debris, generates hidden within the terrain (not exposed to air). This ore, when smelted into netherite scrap and combined with gold ingots, can be turned into netherite ingots. With a smithing table and a netherite upgrade smithing template (also found in bastion remnant chests), they can use these ingots to upgrade any diamond gear to the most powerful toolset tier available.

Three notable structures generate in the Nether, those being nether fortresses, bastion remnants, and ruined portals. Nether fortresses offer useful loot such as nether warts and blaze rods for brewing, saddles for striders, iron/gold ingots, obsidian, and diamonds. Wither skeletons can drop their skulls, which can be used in conjunction with soul sand/soil to summon the wither. Bastion remnants offer an abundance of blackstone, chains, and gold blocks, as well as a variety of gold and (rarely) netherite related items. The pigstep music disc can also be obtained here. Ruined portals are incomplete nether portals often accompanied by crying obsidian, a gold block or two, and likely a chest containing some gold and a flint and steel to ignite the portal, if the player has enough obsidian to restore it. 

#### Useful resources
Netherrack, blackstone, nether quartz ore, nether gold ore, glowstone, soul sand, lava (for smelting), mushrooms, nether fortress loot, bastion remnant loot, ruined portal loot, ghast tears, gunpowder, magma cream, ender pearls, rotten flesh and striders are items, blocks, and entities can that be found throughout the Nether in all or most biomes.

#### General hazards
The most immediate problem is the monsters which spawn, generally regardless of light level.  Bases can be floored with transparent or partial blocks to prevent spawns inside the base.  Depending on the nearby biomes, various other measures are needed: For Endermen, avoid building with blocks they can pick up, and make sure that low ceilings are available for shelter.  For Ghasts, enclose the base completely to prevent them from getting line-of-sight on a player.  Avoiding fragile blocks on the exterior can forestall problems when working near the base.  Piglins can be deterred by placing soul fire (including the torches, lanterns, or campfires) as a perimeter, and pacified by wearing a piece of gold armor.  (Note that they can open doors!)  Hoglins can be deterred with warped fungus, and cannot pass through one-block-wide gaps.  Zombified Piglins are a particular nuisance, because of the hazard of accidentally aggravating them; they can also knock on doors (and in Hard difficulty, break them) even while still neutral.  However, most of the general base-defense techniques (not lava or fire) work against them.  Magma cubes are especially dangerous -- in areas where they can spawn, spawnproofing and a solid perimeter are a must, and low ceilings can at least keep the largest cubes out.

The longer-term problem is the difficulty of farming:  All dirt must be imported, and crops must be farmed "dry".  However, trees and large mushrooms can be farmed normally (given dirt), and large fungi can provide "wood". Hoglins or imported animals can provide meat.
