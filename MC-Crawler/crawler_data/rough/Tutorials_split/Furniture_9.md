### Water spigot
Use this if you're making an outside enclosure for your farm animals. It looks nice and is refillable with rain water.

First put a 3×3 base of cobblestone. Then place a cobblestone wall on top of the middle cobblestone. Then place a lever and Tripwire Hook on opposite sides of a chiseled stone block. Add a Cauldron under the Tripwire Hook, and there you go a sort of working water spigot!

Water Spigot

### Pet door
A pet door is actually quite simple to create and will save you the trouble of having to keep the door open for your pets, such as wolves. To make a pet door make a 1×1 hole in the wall then put pressure plates on both sides of the hole. Inside the hole, put in a fence gate. Now your pets can come in with ease and most monsters won't be able to get in (except for cave spiders, silverfish, and the small slimes)!

### Radio
Basically, all you need are 2 note blocks and an Iron block. First, place the note blocks. Make sure you have a 1 block gap between them. Then, place the iron block in the gap.
You could even place buttons or redstone torches on the blocks to give the feel of having knobs and an antenna or replace one block with a jukebox to play music.

### Fancy jukebox
For this, you will need 4 stair blocks, a jukebox, and a redstone lamp. Optional items are a chest, 2 more stair blocks, a slab, and maybe a few buttons for decoration. First, place the redstone lamp on the floor with the jukebox on top. Then, place two stairs next to the redstone lamp, then place the other two stairs on top of the stairs so it makes a [ shape. If you have buttons, add them where you would like, then place the music disk inside the jukebox! If you are using the chest, place the chest on top of it and add on the other two stair blocks next to the chest on top of the previously placed stairs. Then, put the slab right above the chest (don't worry, the chest will still open).

### Redstone
Try using Redstone to "deploy" furniture. You can even try to make a barren room with everything hidden, with a lever that reveals or creates furniture. This may sound weird, however, it has a cool effect when you actually use it. To do this, you use pistons along the walls, and pull them back with the flick of a lever to reveal your furniture!

Put furniture where the wood slabs are.

### Maps
Maps can be useful, or merely decorative.

#### Wall map
- Materials
	- 1item frame
	- 1map

- To create the map, place the item frame on the wall, and place the map in the item frame.
	- To cover a larger area, place more item frames and maps in a grid-like structure.

#### Floor or table map
- Materials
	- 1sticky piston
	- 1redstone torchOR 4pressure plates

- To create the map, dig two (one, if using pressure plates) blocks down, then place the redstone torch on the bottom, (unless using pressure plates) and on top, place the sticky piston. Now you have a map that, if using the torch, is on a table, and, if using the pressure plates, will pop up when you walk up to it! The green parts simulate land, and the rest simulates the ocean.
	- Once again, to cover a larger area, place more torches and sticky pistons in a grid-like structure. (can't use pressure plates for this) You can also use normal pistons to simulate large tracts of ocean.
	- You can actually put this on the wall, however, if you do, you shouldn't power the pistons.

- Notes
	- Only for decoration; serves no other purpose.
	- May not work in someResource packs

### Wall clock
All you really have to do is place a clock into an item frame and hang it up. Now you can have a wall clock in your house or anywhere you'd like to place it!

### Classical clock
Take two of any block you want (you must be able to put an item frame on it!), place one of the blocks on the floor, and then place the other one on top of the block. Add an item frame with a clock on the top block and you're done! Something optional you could do is to add an item frame on the bottom block with a spade/shovel in it, rotated to be the pendulum.

### Grill
To make a barbecue on the patio or outside of your house, you can craft an anvil and place it where you want on your outdoor space.
