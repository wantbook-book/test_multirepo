#### Corner table
Build a fence and add a wooden pressure plate, carpet/rug or trapdoor on top for a good looking table. Another option is to place a piston in the ground with a redstone torch or block below it. The piston will activate, and will create a nice, one block table.

#### Dining room table
- Place twostairblocks facing each other. Next, place twoslabblocks of your taste on top of them. Some crafters believe that slab floors will make the table more aesthetically pleasing.
	- You could also try thepistontable. The piston table looks cool with acakeon it! Again, some crafters believe that slab floors will make the table more aesthetically pleasing.
- Another method utilizing stair blocks: Place stairs upside-down, and back-to-back. This table can be as small as 2 back-to-back stairs or as large as you like! Slabs and stairs can be used as chairs.
- Place four blocks (e.g., wood planks) for the legs of your table. Then place some upside down slabs in the center of the four legs you just created. Next, place four upside down slabs between the legs to make an awesome table.
- Place a dark block (e.g., such asnether bricks) in a 3×2 hole in your floor. On top of your dark blocks, place glass blocks.
- For larger tables, you can place stone pressure plates or white carpet to serve as dishware. You can use empty flowerpots for cups and/or a chest with prepared food in the middle of the table, too!
- For a simple table, with an actual use, simply use fence posts against your wall, then put wooden pressure plates on top. Once that is done, simply replace the blocks on the wall right above the table (on the same level as the pressure plates) with droppers (dispensers work too, but require a bow to make, unlike droppers). Now, fill the droppers with food, and then all you have to do is walk up to the table, and voila! you have food.
- In later versions you can have fence posts over the whole area of the table and cover them with carpets.
- For plates, you can use item frames (if your tabletop is made out of solid blocks) and put any item of food in them that you like.

#### Modern table
Place two glowstone blocks where you want the center of your table to be, then surround the glowstone blocks with glass panes for a cake and coffee table that will light up your living room! You can also make some more rings of glowstone around the middle glowstone block. 

You can also make a modern table with some carpet, stairs and fences by placing the carpet on top of a fence and then putting the stairs of your choice down in the places you would like it for the seats.

#### Piston table
Extended pistons are usually more aesthetically pleasing than fences with pressure plates, as they form a solid top, rather than one with gaps. You need 6 pistons and 6 redstone torches. Dig the floor 3×2×2 and then fill just one layer of the hole with redstone torches.

Then just cover the hole with pistons (or you could place a sticky piston at random to make it look as though someone spilled) facing upward. The piston table is completed.

#### Simple table
Place 2 blocks above where you want your table, now create a 2 block deep hole below the blocks above your table (3 if you include the gap for the table which should already be there), get into the hole, look up and place 2 stairs facing each other on the bottom of them, get out the hole and fill it in, now remove the 2 blocks above the table, you now have a nice simple table.

Note: Remember to fill the hole.

#### Tablecloths
Using carpet blocks, you can replace the pressure plates on tables with carpet, or perhaps top your piston arms with the aforementioned block. This will create a nice-looking tablecloth. Use it anywhere, from fancy restaurants to cave homes!

#### Stone age table
This table is simple, yet looks glorious on medieval structures or mansions. Start by putting a cobblestone slab at the top, and surround it with upside-down cobblestone stairs- don't forget to destroy the corners after. in the middle, put a flower pot and plant it with your favorite flower (Allium or Azure bluet recommended). Make chairs and put iron pressure plates on top of cobblestone stairs. Enjoy!

### TV
There are two main designs for televisions in Minecraft. You can make a decorative TV that is really just coal blocks, black wool, or obsidian decoratively in or on the wall or floor. You could also just use a 2×1 painting starting from left to right to imitate a flat-screen TV. You can also put two blocks of any material, two fences up top and a 2×1 painting on the fence.

Another possible design is using a 4×2×1 space. The TV is made by placing 4 blocks of Black Concrete, Coal Blocks, Obsidian, or another black block in a 2 blocks high, 2 blocks tall shape and putting 2 note blocks or jukeboxes on either side of it.



A more expensive method is by putting a redstone lamp in the wall with a lever next to it, and a painting over the lamp. When the lever is pulled, light will shine through the painting.

Another design is to place two furnaces at the bottom, two obsidian on top, and a 2×1 painting in front where you want the screen, then place two iron blocks vertically across the sides and place a button on each one.

Five Basic Chair Designs made from oak. From left to right: Arm Chair, Study Chair (with item frames), Dining Chair (with oak signs), Sofa, and Lounge Chair.
