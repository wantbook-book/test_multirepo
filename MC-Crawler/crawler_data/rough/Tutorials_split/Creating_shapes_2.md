### Parabolas
Parabolas are conic sections that are U-shaped curves. A formula for a parabola is y = x2. Using this, it is relatively simple to build. Just step 1 block, then increase the number of blocks by a constant. The example below stars with a line 1 block tall, with each subsequent line being 2 blocks taller than the one before.

### Circles
Circles are rather difficult to make in Minecraft, partially because of the fact that unlike triangles, there is not one way to make any size of circle; each size uses a completely different arrangement of blocks. As you look at the different sizes of circles, you will see that not all of them have the same shape, and none of them are a perfect circle. This is because different sizes of circles must have different arrangements of blocks, so that they can look as close to a circle as possible.

The pattern of blocks for every circle cannot be explained, because, like mentioned earlier, each size has a completely different pattern. The best way to make a circle is to just experiment with different block arrangements, or look at images made by other people who experimented with block arrangements and made a circle. The diagrams only show quarter circles; the full circles are obtained by reflecting the quarter-circles along the top and left edges. For circles with odd diameters, reflect along the center of the first line of blocks.
