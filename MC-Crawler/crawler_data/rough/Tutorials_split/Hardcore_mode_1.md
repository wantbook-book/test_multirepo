### Settings and Options
There are many ways, in-game and otherwise, to alter aspects of Hardcore mode.

- Try to maximize framerate.
	- Close any other applications.
	- Weigh the advantages of features that may cause low FPS (such as particles, graphics type, etc.)
		- In particular, turning down the Rendering Distance (in [Esc] > Options > Video Settings) can greatly improve FPS as well as reducing lag spikes. In addition to performance, leaving the Rendering Distance at 2 effectively stops almost all mobs from spawning in low light levels, thus nullifying the greatest challenge associated with Hardcore mode.  Do note, however, that this may feel cheaty and may reduce the fun of the experience.
	- Jungles and waterfalls cause lag on low-end systems. In some circumstances, client-side chunk update lag is instantly fatal. Consider restarting the game or reducing your chunk radius if you spawn in a jungle or mountains.
- In Video Settings, set brightness to "bright" to make things a bit easier, or "moody" for greater difficulty.
- Use sound. Listen to everything;Creepersmake sounds walking on blocks.Parrotscan be even more useful for those purposes.
	- Even if you do have sounds turned on, usesubtitles; they can alert the player if any sounds are nearby.
- Avoid using unfamiliarresource packs. Sometimes it can be beneficial to get a resource pack that changes certain textures slightly (for example, by slightly brightening the nether brick texture it becomes more obvious where it is safe to step in nether fortresses), but you should get used to the textures in regular survival first.
- Turn on hitboxes. It can be useful to see monsters in the dark.
- By picking the seed (instead of using a random seed), the world can be controlled. This can vary the difficulty in many ways.
	- For example, the uncharted island in the middle of the sea is easy to control mob spawning on, while in mountains and ravines, creepers descending from heights can more easily surprise you.
	- A seed with a stronghold inside a mushroom fields biome would make the process of reaching the end portal much easier.
	- If you know a world well from Survival mode, you can use its seed (or the "Re-Create" button) to take advantage of that knowledge in Hardcore mode.
- Some players choose to save a back-up of their hardcore world in case they die (especially before entering the Nether, or the End). Many people consider this cheating, as it can "ruin" the feel and purpose of Hardcore mode.
- Game rules can be used to increase difficulty. Example: In Ultra Hardcore mode, natural regeneration is turned off. The only way you can regenerate health is by consuminggolden apples,enchanted golden apples, fully poweredbeaconor by usingpotions, for example, Instant Health or Regeneration.
	- Command:/gamerule naturalRegeneration false
	- You can also turn on reduction of debug info, making it far easier to get lost in a world, and practically mandating the usage of maps and compasses.

### Shelters
Shelters are important, especially on Hardcore. Building a proper shelter makes Hardcore mode slightly less difficult. Shelters are never optional for night-time, although they may be temporary.

- Mushroom fields biomes are safe places to settle because hostile mobs do not spawn under normal conditions.
- A shelter built over an ocean away from land can also be safe from hostile mobs, unless you are near an ocean monument. However,drownedcan spawn in oceans, making them not as safe. It is recommended to build your shelter a few blocks above the ocean, just in case ofdrowned, or ocean monuments.
- It's best to build shelters out of blast-resistant materials, especially inthe Nether.Cobblestoneis cheap, although, if possible, permanent shelters should useobsidian.
- Make your shelter as visible as possible. Proper lighting outside the shelter adds visibility, and stops hostile mobs from spawning nearby.  Additionally, a large tower can help visibilty from a distance (but make sure you can get down safely!)
- Zombiescan break wooden doors; however, iron doors require six ingots to craft, and need redstone power. To solve this, use a fence gate with a pressure plate inside the shelter so it automatically closes. One gate does not stopskeletonsfrom shooting over it, so a second gate can be placed on top of the first. Additionally, you can place the door such that its "open" state blocks entry, thus preventing zombies from doing any damage.
- Because the shady canopies of trees protectskeletonsand zombies from burning, build an indoor tree farm to safely harvest logs and apples when necessary. For the same reason, it is a good idea to cut down trees within 24 blocks of your shelter and fully light the resulting field.
- Even small farms withwheat,potato,chickens, andcowscan be a great asset. Use the wheat and seeds to breed the animals for meat and other drops. Indoor farms are safer. Pigs are nice to have because porkchops can be safely eaten raw if you're caught by surprise.
- Keep in mind the coordinates of your base, assuming you can obtain them.
- Building a wall around your base can be extremely beneficial.

### Mining
- Never go unprepared into a cave in case you get surrounded or cornered. Always bring blocks, weapons, food, torches and armor with you.
- Be careful aroundcave spiders.Poisoncannot actually kill you but it weakens you severely. Only fight cave spiders if you desperately needstringorspider eyes. If you need spider drops it is best to fight plainspidersor loot dungeons if you have the choice.
- Diamondsare not hard to find if you travel in deep caves. They also have a 23% higher spawn rate. That being said, the common hazards are monsters, lava, and falls. The least you need is iron armor and a stone sword to go in. Diamonds are not difficult to find in Dripstone caves & Lush Caves. Watch out for mobs, they can spawn a lot there.
- If you happen to fall in lava in the overworld, swim to the surface and place water above (not under) the lava. This way, the obsidian formed can provide you with an escape route.
	- Fall damage can be avoided by placing water to break the fall.
- Do not ever dig straight down or up. Digging straight down could cause the player to fall into lava or a horde of monsters, and digging straight up could cause a falling block such assandorgravelto fall and suffocate the player, or lava to pour down and burn the player. It is best to dig straight up or down in a wider pattern, to have a platform to stand on before digging down the blocks. Having a platform with a block above it could help allow the player to escape falling blocks without death.
	- Remember that a torch on the floor breaks any gravel or sand falling on it. This can save you from getting buried if you dig straight up (although you're still in trouble if you break into water or lava or a bunch of mobs).
