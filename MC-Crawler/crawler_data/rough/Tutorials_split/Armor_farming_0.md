# Tutorials/Armor farming
Armor can be farmed via random drops from mobs such as zombies or skeletons, or by trading with villagers. While generally, large amounts of armor aren't required and can be crafted, a farm can be useful for creating decorative armor stands or for visitors in a multiplayer survival world.

## Villager trading method
An efficient way of farming armor is to trade with villagers. Armorer villagers and leatherworker villagers both will trade the player armor in return for emeralds. The leatherworker is not recommended because it only trades for leather armor, which is one of the lowest-tiered armor in the game.

### Getting emeralds
In order to get enough emeralds to trade for armor, you are going to need to have an efficient way of getting emeralds. There are two different ways of doing this. One is making a redstone farm, and trading the items you receive to the villagers. Another one is to construct a raid farm, which gets automatic emeralds through ongoing, simulated raids.

##### 
The first way of getting large quantities of emeralds is to build a redstone farm which a villager will buy for cheap, and continuously trade that same item to multiple villagers of that profession. To do this you will need to trap multiple villagers inside of an area with a profession block in front of them (whichever villager trades the item you are making a redstone farm for) so that their profession changes to the villager of your choosing. Once you have an ample amount of them (4-6) you will also want to gather 4-6 armorer villagers so that you can farm the armor more easily. The armorer's profession block is a blast furnace. Once you have done this, start working on contructing a redstone farm. Some farms that are very profitable in emeralds are:

- Melon & pumpkin farm: Farmer
- Sugarcane farm(turn to paper): Librarian, Cartographer
- TNT wood farm(turn to sticks): Fletcher
- Bamboo farm(turn to sticks): Fletcher
- Iron Farm: Toolsmith, Weaponsmith, Armorer

##### Raid farm method
The raid farm method is where you construct a raid farm to farm emeralds, as well as various other items, including totems of undying. This can be a wonderful method because you only have to set up a raid farm, instead of set up a redstone farm, and trade to the villagers, going back and forth. Here are some links to tutorials to get started:

- Rays Works Raid Farm—3500 per hour
- Shulkercraft Raid Farm—3300 per hour
- IanXO4 Raid Farm—3000+ per hour
- Wattles Raid Farm—Easy, XP, Loot & Efficient

### Trading
Once you have got enough emeralds, and once you have got all of your armorer villagers in place you must start to trade. The reason you want multiple of the armorer villagers is because a singular villager can only have a maximum of 10 trades, so to get every single option of armor, you will want multiple villagers with different trades. You will see that immediately there are some iron armor trades and you can trade for as many of those as you want. Once you upgrade the villagers to apprentice you may start to see trades for chainmail armor. Then finally, at expert and master you will see enchanted diamond armor trades. To upgrade a villager simply trade with them enough for the bar at the top to fill all the way up. Once it fills completely the villager will upgrade with new trades. You must be strategic with what you trade, because villagers can only trade 4 times for a certain trade at a time until they restock. Villagers can restock up to two times per game day.

## Enchanting
The most efficient way to get the best set of armor is to put enchanted books on armor in the anvil. You can stack up to six enchanted books on an item in survival mode, or up to 12 if you combine two books together and then put them on the armor piece. To get the best enchantments on your armor you will need to gather the enchanted books, gather the armor, and get levels and an anvil to combine them.

### Gathering enchanted books
To gather the perfect enchanted books for your armor there are many ways you can do it. You can trade with librarian villagers, put books in an enchanting table, or find them throughout the minecraft world. Enchanted books are crucial for this process.

##### Trade with villagers
One way to get the enchanted books you need is to trade with librarian villagers. To do this you will need to gather a very large amount of villagers by constructing a villager breeder, and you will have to craft 12-16 lectern blocks (Those are the profession blocks for librarian villagers). Move the villages into an 1×1×2 space and place a lectern in front of them to convert them to librarians. If they do not have the enchanted book trade you like, you can break and re-place the lectern block over and over again to get the enchanted books you want. Next you will have to gather emeralds to trade with the villagers. Refer to the 'Getting Emeralds' section above for ways to get lots of emeralds.
