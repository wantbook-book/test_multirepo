### 4 spawn modules 2-level
Requires spawn chunks: no
Iron per hour: 160
Scalable: yes
Design by: JL2579 (tutorial by docm77)

** Description **
This design, originally created by JL2579, uses 4 spawning modules, with 2 modules per level, with doors surrounding the modules. This pattern could be repeated to fill a very large area with iron farms. The farm also features a lava system to damage the iron golems so that the piston suffocator works more quickly. Youtuber docm77 made this tutorial for the design.





### Simpler JL2579 design
Requires spawn chunks: no
Iron per hour: 30
Scalable: yes (you can build a second farm 80 blocks overhead to increase the spawning rates)
Design by: Nims

** Description **
This design, by NimsTV, is less efficient than JL2579's design. However, it is much simpler and easier to build, because the water streams are easier to configure and there is only one villager basket. The golem spawning area is larger than the farm, which is why JL2579 did not build his farm in this way. You have to block spawning anywhere outside the farm, if you intend to build several duplicate farms in an array.





### The Iron Stream
Requires spawn chunks: no
Iron per hour: 640
Scalable: no
Design by: Eta740

** Description **

This design is a 16 Village Iron Farm that can be rebuilt on demand if not built in the spawn chunks and the chunk it is in has been unloaded. The village rebuild process takes 24 minutes and it will produce 640 ingots per hour when running at full speed. 




### 
Requires spawn chunks: no but you will get more regular iron if you do build them there
Iron per hour: 41+
Scalable: yes (you can build a second farm 65 blocks away from the village center). Possible to fit 36 within the spawn chunks (though not easily).
Design by: GruvaGuy

** Description **

This is a single village iron farm designed by GruvaGuy in 1.9 using Golem spawn mechanics to achieve a 100% efficient iron farm. Very different to most designs and can be placed flush on the ground without any digging required. Though this is as efficient as possible it is also expensive in resources. The mechanics show in the video can be applied to most other iron farms.  




### 
Requires spawn chunks: no
Iron per hour: 1200
Scalable: No
Design by: Comet 107

** Description **
This design is a 30 village iron farm that can be rebuilt on demand if not built in the spawn chunks and the chunk it is in has been unloaded. The village rebuild process takes just over 40 minutes and it will produce 1200 ingots per hour when running at full speed.  





### The Iron Casster
Requires spawn chunks: no
Iron per hour: 640-3800
Scalable: no
Design by: GruvaGuy

** Description **
This design is an expandable 16-96 village iron farm that can be rebuilt on demand if not built in the spawn chunks and the chunk it is in has been unloaded. The village rebuild process takes up to 106 minutes for 96 villages and it will produce 3800 ingots per hour when running at full speed.





### 
Requires spawn chunks: no
Iron per hour: 6700
Scalable: no
Design by: Comet 107

** Description **

This design is a 168 village iron farm that can be rebuilt on demand if not built in the spawn chunks and the chunk it is in has been unloaded. This iron farm resets 2 villages at the same time giving it a faster reset speed than most other designs. The village rebuild process takes 96 minutes and it will produce 6700 ingots per hour when running at full speed.

### The Iron Bakery
Requires spawn chunks: yes
Iron per hour: 500 each layer with 10 rows of doors
Scalable: yes
Design by: Emonadeo

** Description **
A great advantage to this design is the customization. You can decide how big and efficient it gets by changing the number of the rings of doors and/or layers. It uses a similar door placement to the Iron Titan by Tango Tek. It is also efficient on smaller multiplayer servers.

Emonadeo has since released a video on how to fix it for 1.9/1.10





### 
Design by: Panda

** Description **
The most important part of any farm is its spawning floor, both in regards to maximising spawning area and the speed at which it can remove spawned entities to be replaced. In the following video, Panda describes a unique spawn floor design that drastically increases both of these. Combine this spawn floor with any of the other designs to improve its output. (Spawnpads still work in 1.8). 





### Iron Nucleus
Requires spawn chunks: no
Iron per hour: 1000+
Scalable: yes
Design by: SwoodyCraft

** Description **
This design uses offset stacks of villages allowing players to compress a large number into a relatively small space (27 villages in less than 150 sq blocks). It is highly efficient and requires relatively low amount of resources to build. It does not require any redstone to build nor does it have to be built at spawn. The only limiting factor (as with any iron farm) is that it must be built at least 64 blocks from any other village. 





### Flexible design
Requires spawn chunks: no
Iron per hour: 30 - 40 (depending on configuration)
Scalable: yes (As long as the second farm is constructed 70 blocks away)
Design by: MCinstructabuilds

** Description **
This design is not as efficient as some other designs. However, it is simple to build and lends itself to variation and disguise. The spawning area for the golems is 16Ã—16, but can be made smaller by digging 8 blocks down around the edges if desired. The doors are placed equally around the spawning area, but specific placement can be varied. It is this varied door placement that allows the farm to be easily camouflaged. MCinstructabuilds provides three example disguises, a fort, a town, and a mining camp / Furnace. Unlike other designs the villagers are not kept contained. The Farm can be constructed easily and at ground level.
