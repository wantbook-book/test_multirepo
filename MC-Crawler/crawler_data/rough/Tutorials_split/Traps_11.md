### Chests
Chests, especially when paired with signs, can make a good lure. If you place one inconspicuously in a wooden house, what self respecting griefer would not go and investigate?

### Ore blocks
Ore blocks make an irresistible lure. After all, if you saw a diamond block just sitting there on the ground, would you just leave it there? This lure is good when paired with a BUD trigger.

### Fake mineshaft
Mineshafts are known for lots of loot. If you trap one, you can pretend to have 'accidentally given away directions' to the mineshaft.

### Iron door
An iron door looks somewhat out of place in a dark cave. If a player sees one, they may be tempted to go inside. Unfortunately for them, there may only be a pressure plate on one side of the door, or a landmine hidden under the plate.

## Disarming traps
When faced with a trap, the safest course of action is usually to leave the way you came. If the player really wants to disarm it though, here are some tips:

- Don't try to trip the trap and run away. Unless you have a really safe way of doing this, the trap is probably designed to prevent you from doing this.
- Watch out forobservers. These can be placed inside walls and underpressure platesas a fail safe.
- Don't assume it is safe to break redstone. It is usually safer to keep redstone in its current state. If it is off, it might be okay to break it. If it is on, it might be okay to place aredstone torchto keep it on. In elaborate traps the redstone may blink to check if it is broken, so watch out!
- TNTinwatergenerally doesn't do much damage. If you have awater bucket, it may be helpful to use it if you think everything is about to blow up.
- Try to always check for traps. If you see apressure platenext to aniron door, check forobserversbelow the plate, and break the door and plate, and go in. Another problem is underground traps. For ore traps, check for observers again, break them, and then mine the ore.
