# Tutorials/Traps
Traps are a common mechanism in multiplayer built by players to kill other players or mobs automatically. The following is a list of basic traps with a short tutorial that often assumes the reader has a working understanding of the basic concepts required to build the trap. Most traps are considered to be mechanisms, though some are not classified as such.

## Overview
Traps are devices designed to trap or damage entities, often referred to as targets. Traps are often made up of 3 components: A lure, a trigger, and the damage source. In a simple landmine, the lure could be a base behind the landmine, the trigger a pressure plate, the damage source TNT. Not all traps have a lure, they may rely on chance or something else to lure the target. Feel free to add any ideas of traps you have here. Just follow the style guide and everyone will have new strategies to remove their enemies.

A list of components for a good trap can be seen below: 

## Trigger components
These components are a trigger that allows the rest of the trap to work.

### Pressure plates
Pressure plates are commonly used to detect whether an entity or item presses on it . There are 4 variants (viz.wooden pressure plate, stone pressure plate, light-weighted pressure plate, and heavily weighted pressure plate.)

#### Wooden
Wooden pressure plates measure all entities and give out maximum signal strength. The most commonly used pressure plate. Useful if you want to detect anything including items being thrown. Works best when paired with an observer.

#### Stone
Stone pressure plates measure only players and mobs and give out maximum signal strength. The second most commonly used pressure plate. Useful if you want to detect only a player or mob. Works best when paired with an observer.

#### Light-weighted
Light-weighted pressure plates measure all entities, and the strength increases as more entities are added. Useful if you want to detect a specific number of entities. Works better with only redstone dust if the pressure plate is for detecting entities and not players.

#### Heavy-weighted
Heavy-weighted pressure plates are similar to a light weighted pressure plate but they measure groups of 10 entities per redstone comparator output.

### Observers
Observers are most commonly used to detect whether a block state changes (ie: an ore trap). They are useful if you want to kill someone destroying a block in your base, a TNT lighting, redstone getting activated, containers being opened, furnaces turning on or off, etc.

### String
String, when connected to a pair of tripwire hooks or an observer, can detect when a player/mob steps through it or breaks it. It is also difficult to see.
