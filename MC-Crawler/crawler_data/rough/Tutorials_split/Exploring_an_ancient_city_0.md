# Tutorials/Exploring an ancient city
Ancient cities are among the most dangerous and challenging structures to explore in the game. It is mostly dark throughout, and while the cities do not have any normal hostile mobs in them, they are home to wardens, which can easily slaughter players, even in full netherite armor.

There are several benefits in going to an ancient city:

- To obtainsculk catalysts, which allow you to infinitely farm other blocks of thesculk family.
- Obtainingsoul-related blocksandbasaltwithout having to go tothe Nether.
- An easy way to obtainskeleton skullswithout having to work withcharged creepers.
- Only way to obtain the Ward and Silencearmor trims, the latter being the rarest armor trim in the game.
- Only way to obtain usefulSwift Sneakenchanted books, as well as other potentially useful enchanted books.
- Only way to obtainecho shards, which can be used to craft arecovery compass.
- Only way to obtaindisc fragments, which can be used to craft the"5" music disc.
- Good way to get treasure items likeenchanted golden apples,"otherside" music discs, anddiamond horse armor, which are more likely to appear in ancient city chests than at any other type of structure.
- Contains highly enchanted ironleggings, diamond leggings and diamondhoes.
- The city can be converted into a mob-proof base after all the sculk shriekers are removed, as hostile mobs cannot spawn there.
- Mining thesculk blockswithout Silk Touch as a method of obtaining large amounts ofexperience.
- Obtaining theDarknesseffect necessary for completing the "How Did We Get Here?" advancement.â€Œ[Java Edition  only]
- Certain sculk shriekers can be kept and used tocontinuously spawn wardens, either for farming sculk catalysts, or for creating amob switch.

## What you need
- Patience, as you must sneak for almost the entirety of your journey through the ancient city.
- InJava Edition, you can change someaccessibility settingsto make exploring the ancient city easier.
	- You can change the "Sneak" option from "Hold" to "Toggle", so you don't need to continuously hold down the sneak key.
	- You can also turn the "Darkness Pulsing" value from 100% to a lower value, as that might help you see better under the Darkness effect.
- A safe escape route, so that you can leave as fast as possible if things go wrong.
	- You could also build a fortified and closed-off "panic room" that you can flee into and take cover inside.
- Don't bring your valuables here unless the ancient city is secured. The warden is guaranteed to kill you even if you have full netherite armor, so your best bet is to not summon the warden at all.

### Necessary equipment
- Multiple stacks ofwoolorcarpetsfor building and blocking off vibrations.
- A pair ofshearsto break wool quickly, and to collect the wool generated on the floor of corridors in case you run out of wool, optionally enchanted withEfficiencyV toinstantly minewool.
	- Someiron ingotsto craft more shears.
- The usualpickaxe, and any other tools you usually take with you.
- Ahoeto destroy the dangeroussculk shriekersandsculk sensors.
	- Silk Touchis optional. Although it allows you to collect various sculk blocks, these blocks occupy precious inventory slots that might be reserved for more valuable loot in the chests. It is recommended to obtain these blocks outside the ancient city where breaking blocks is a lot safer.
- A significant supply of goodfood, likecooked porkchopsorgolden carrots.
- SomeNight Visionpotions, which allows you to see under theDarknesseffect, without having to place down light sources that might trigger sculk sensors. You can also use recoursepacks with Fulbright or something.
- Abedin case you die, but do not place it too near or inside the ancient city itself.
- Some projectiles for distracting the warden in case it spawns. Choose either (or both) of the following:
	- Somesnowballsoreggs. Eggs can spawn chickens for distractions.
	- Abow(orcrossbow) and somearrows, or just one if the bow hasInfinity.

### Optional equipment
- Aboatto be able to row down without taking damage.
- A fewmilk bucketsto remove theDarknesseffect.  Be warned that consuming food/drink items may alert nearbysculk sensors.
- Somegolden applesorenchanted golden applesto quickly heal.
- Anender pearlor two. While player-thrown projectiles can alert nearbysculk shriekersand consequentially spawn more wardens, an ender pearl can allow you to teleport away from a dangerous situation in a pinch.
- A pair ofelytraand somefirework rocketsto fly away quickly once a warden spawns.
- A full set of netheritearmor, ideally withProtectionIV. This may allow you to survive a few melee hits from the warden, but it does not offer any protection against its sonic boom attack.
- Aspyglassto check from far away if there aresculk sensorsand/orsculk shriekers(though you can also download zooming mods such as OptiFine).
- Anender chestto put the loot away, so you don't lose the loot if you die.
- Abrewing standand necessary resources (blaze powder,water bottles,Nether wart,golden carrots) to make potions of Night Vision, if you intend to use them heavily; it is recommended to extend their duration withredstone dust.
- Someiron blocksand acarved pumpkinto summon aniron golem, which automatically attack Wardens on sight.  While a single golem doesn't last long and may be expensive to create, it may distract an angry warden for a few seconds and might buy you enough time to escape death.
- Some noise-making blocks, such asbellsornote blocks, and the resources to make aredstone clock(ideally 2observersto save inventory space), which you can use to lure wardens toward the bell and away from you.
