## 
The lack of planks and crafting tables prevents you from crafting a bed. As a result, you cannot reset your spawn point and you cannot sleep.

As you can't set your spawn point, build a strong defensive base at or near your spawn point. If your main base is not at your spawn point, build a smaller survival shelter exactly centered on your spawn point, but with walls far enough away from the spawn point that you respawn inside the walls, not outside. Ideally, create a safe tunnel or enclosed passageway to your main base.

This is why at the start of a new game, before you even move, you should dig down one block to mark your exact spawn point, then add another marking to make it clear it's the spawn point (a 5 X 5 ditch, for example). It's also a good idea, at the start of the game, to dig a directional arrow in the ground pointing to the rising sun. And, early on, create a tall pillar by pillar-jumping, so you can find your way back to your spawn-point and base if you get lost (as often happens when fleeing or fighting mobs).

Lack of sleep brings phantoms every night. The best way to deal with these is to build a roof garden on your house with 'potted' cacti (cacti on a one-high sand block). Once the cacti are two blocks high the phantoms attack relentlessly and die against the cacti without harming you. However, you must offer yourself as bait so that they crash into the cacti. The phantoms can then kill themselves before the sun rises, and you can go about your daytime activities in peace.

Once you find a village, sleep, then break some of the beds and carry them with you. Leave at least one bed (the one you slept in) in case you are killed and respawn there, and for when you are visiting that village.

## Storage
Unless you find a village or other structure containing chests, barrels, or other storage, you have no form of persistent storage and no way to create any (because there are no planks). Your personal inventory is your only persistent storage. Your personal inventory is actually quite limited. There are some considerations that arise from this: 

Only break blocks that you definitely need. Don't clutter your inventory with anything except what you can actually use. Don't be a hoarder!

Remember, any time you break a block, the item is now on a timer to despawn. Either now, or later if you are forced to drop it. So break blocks only when you need them, or when you are going to leave the area behind. An unbroken block does not despawn and remains there forever until you need it.

If you find any chests, break them and bring them to your main base. The chest may be more valuable than the items in it. Keep at least one chest in each location, though. Don't remove all chests from a village, for example.

## Mining
Digging, tunneling and mining in the desert are challenging because the sand collapses. It is problematic (but not impossible) to build lower levels under your house for storage, workspace, greater safety, or mining. Mining and tunneling, in general, are made difficult by the scarcity of roofing material and the gravity effects on sand. Further limiting factors are usually the lack of tools, time, and light. Tunnel ceilings need to be built from above, before digging a tunnel through the sand. Otherwise, it becomes a ditch, and/or you suffocate in it. Similarly, mines tend to be strip mines or open cast mines rather than underground mines.

For large scale mining probably the best approach is to mark out a large square and cut steps down the side of the square in a continuous spiral. For example, a 16Ã—16 square allows you to dig down about 60 layers without needing roofing materials or light sources. (You might want to check your altitude with F3 before starting a mining project). Without tools, progress is slow, and you can potentially waste ore as well. Arguably, there is not much point starting a mine (except a sand mine) unless you have first obtained a pickaxe.

It's probably a good idea to build some survival shelters at the top of the staircase and at intervals along with it, in case you get caught by nightfall or by something blocking your path back to your house.

An alternative approach is to make your spiral steps go down half the way around, then come back up again. This has the advantage of giving you at least one escape route. It allows you to lure a creeper down one entrance, to try to get it to explode at the bottom, and still escape through the other exit. It might be an idea to block the exit with sand blocks to make sure you don't have another mob blocking your way when you try to escape.

Creepers cannot only help you mine stone or cobblestone; they can also (in Superflat, for example) help you mine down to those useful layers first. If you are good at persuading creepers to explode, without harming you too badly, you can use a series of creeper explosions to dig down. This could save you a lot of time and effort. The other really good thing about creeper explosions is that they cause some of the affected blocks to drop as items. This probably the only way to achieve those drops without some kind of pick.

If you mine (Creeper or otherwise) down to a solid (non-gravity affected) block layer, and if you have a pickaxe and any source of light (torches or lava), you can then mine in the normal way.
