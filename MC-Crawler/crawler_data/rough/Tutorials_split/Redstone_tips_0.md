# Tutorials/Redstone tips
This tutorial gives general advice for building with redstone.   There are a variety of pages discussing how redstone works, mostly collected in the page Tutorials/Redstone.

## Planning
The first step in building a redstone circuit is to decide what it will do and how, in general, it will operate.

- How and where will it be controlled?
	- Will the circuit be controlled by the player, by mob movement, or something else?
- What mechanism components will it control?
- What is an efficient first design?
	- Although refinement often occurs in later stages of the build, starting on a strong foot to tackle the idea will be beneficial later on. Allowing an inefficient/flawed design to manifest can hinder development.
- How will the signal be transmitted from the controls to the mechanisms?
	- Will signals need to be combined from multiple sources?

### Size
When making redstone, its important to make it a reasonable size.

You shouldn't use a huge amount of space for a single contraption. Large builds take up a lot of space and are inconvenient. However, you also shouldn't try to create a fully functional redstone circuit in a tiny area. Complex redstone circuits often need plenty of space to function. For example, you cannot create a redstone computer which can perform number operations and display multiple items on a screen at once in only 1 chunk.

For the best redstone results, make your contraption as small as you can with it still functioning, but if you find you're having any troubles with that size, make it bigger. Also, make sure to never underestimate how much time, space or materials you will need. It's much better to overestimate and bring more than you need so that you have extras for next time.

### Creative Mode
A complex redstone project for a Survival world can be designed in Creative mode first, before investing resources and effort in a survival world.  It's handy to keep a creative-mode world handy for such laboratory work, usually a superflat with cheats on.  You can also manipulate the game rules for your testing world to your liking, such as to make it permanent day or avoid mob spawning.   Creative mode is great for building, because you have an infinite number of blocks, you can break blocks right away, and you can fly around to look all around your structures. You can also press F3 + N to invoke spectator mode, then fly through to look inside your circuit. 

Once you have finished your redstone contraption and gotten it working, look it over to make sure you understand how it's working now.  You may be able to make some improvements here.  But eventually, you go back to your survival-mode world,  gather the materials, and just copy your design from creative mode. Optionally, you can count how many of each material you used when building in creative mode, so that you will know exactly how much of a certain material to gather when in survival.

### Gathering Resources
When making very large redstone contraptions, you may need farms for renewable resources. Here are some materials you may need to farm:

- Redstone:   There are only a couple ofrenewablesources of redstone: killingwitches(witch and raid farms are rather slow) or trading withClerics(which is even slower).  However, it is fairly plentiful in the underground, especially once you have a Fortune III pickaxe to multiply its drops.
- String:  Aspider farmcan help if your contraption includes a lot of tripwires and/ordispensers. Piglin bartering is an alternative
- Iron ingots(Make aniron golem farmif you need a lot ofhoppersorminecarts)
- Slimeballs: (Forsticky pistonsand/orslime blocks)
- Honey Blocks: Used in some mobile constructions.  Requiresfarming bees.
- Stone and Cobblestone:  Smooth stone for repeaters and comparators, cobble for pistons, dispensers/droppers, etc.
- Nether Quartz:  Plentiful in the Nether, can be renewably farmed with bartering.  With it, you get to use comparators, observers, and daylight detectors.
- Glowstone:  Used for Redstone Lamps, or lighting.  Can be found fairly easily in the Nether, or it can be purchased from Clerics or Wandering Traders.  Witches can also drop small amounts of the dust.
