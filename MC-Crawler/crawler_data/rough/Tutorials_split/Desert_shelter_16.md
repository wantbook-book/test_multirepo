### Sky city
Description

A giant island with a city on top.

Materials

- Any 100 blocks
- Over 7 stacks ofironblocks
- Over 5 stacks ofwood planks
- Over 4 stacks ofgoldblocks
- Over 3 stacks ofquartz

- Somedirtandwater, ahoeand some seeds

Construction

With your 100 blocks, build up straight a pillar and go up. When you reach the 100 block mark, build a gigantic circular platform, using about half of your iron blocks. Build skyscrapers and houses with the iron and gold blocks, maybe a palace for you to rest, inns, shacks and huts with planks- and some defense. Now, decorate the houses and the palace, light up the entire city, build a garden and a farm, and enjoy your brand-new, cool-looking sky city.

Extras

- Storage rooms?
- Spider-proof walls?
- Villagers?
- Meeting place?
- Party room?
- A wool "cloud" to "support" your city?

Pros

- Visually attractive.
- You can get a nice view of the world below you.
- It would be hard for griefers to find your city

Cons

- You have to make a complicated system if you want to transport animals other than chickens.
- Going down might be easy, but going up is difficult. There is also a risk of falling if you don't wall off the city.
- Costs a WHOLE LOT of blocks.

## Impossible
These structures take a notoriously long time to build and may be impossible on Survival mode. However, they offer perfect protection.

### Bedrock Cube
Description

A gigantic cube of bedrock that can act as a shield for an inner base. Slits in it can accommodate TNT cannons.

Note: You cannot obtain bedrock in Survival without commands. Even if you managed to break bedrock using glitches, the bedrock won't drop as an item.

Necessary materials

- Creative mode
- Bedrock
- TNT
- Luxury blocks (diamond, emerald, gold, lapis, etc.)
- A lot of time

Construction

Build a wall 100 blocks high and down to the bedrock layer. Make the base outline of a square and fill in all gaps with bedrock. Leave slits for TNT cannons. Then, turn the ground below the place where you are going to build the base into a crater and fill with lava before sealing it off. Then, build a column up and form a platform. Then, it's up to you.

Extras

- TNT cannons
- Fireball cannons
- Arrow cannons
- Lava trenches
- Air bombers
- Graveyard
- Prison
- Anything you want!

### The dome
Description

This is a gigantic indestructible dome made out of barrier blocks.

Note: Barrier cannot be obtain without commands, so this is required to be built in Creative.

Necessary materials

- Creative mode
- Barrier blocks
- Anything you like

Construction

First, build a massive dome out of barrier. This is difficult and time-consuming. The dome should has the diameter of at least 200 blocks. If you have mods that allow you to build beyond 256 blocks, the dome should has the diameter of 900 blocks. Then build a city (or a village, town, etc). You can also build a castle, palace, mansion under the dome. If you want to expand the dome city (without mods to build beyond world limit), build multiple dome cities, and connect them with roads under bedrock tunnels (so people from outside cannot go inside). Built properly, this could be beautiful and protective.

Extras

- A glass dome under the barrier dome for decoration.
- Anything a city could have.
- Castle, palace, mansions, arenas, etc. You can build whatever you want!
- SeeTutorials/Breaking bedrock.

## Innovative Dwellings
These types of dwellings are mostly to impress other players, or are amazingly dangerous to live in.

Description

This type of shelter can vary in location and security. For example, an innovative dwelling could be located within a double dungeon (with the spawners still there), built into the bottom of an overhang, or above a lava lake! Innovative dwellings are usually much more difficult to live in and build; however, they work with the map and are great for impressing other players.

Location

The location of this type of shelter can vary drastically, depending on the map, and on the player's preference. 

### Types
Jungle Treehouse[edit | edit source]
This type of house is hard to make, but almost no mobs can get you. First, find a jungle and either pillar up a giant tree or use ladders/vines (recommended.) Once on top of the tree, just make a house. It's an awesome idea to make bridges to other giant trees, to use either as a great lookout point or as extra rooms for your base inside the leaves of the tree. If you're feeling ambitious and have a lot of time, make a huge treetop village and invite your friends! You can keep adding more and more... the possibilities are endless!

### Dungeons
Dungeon dwellings require minimal preparation on the part of the player. They are small, and there is also the risk of spawned enemies as well as caverns nearby. Many are located deep underground, so they can be relatively difficult to locate and navigate to. Leaving the spawner in for decoration can serve as the player's death sentence.
However, advantages of this type of home are little setup, free mob drops (if one decides to set up as a mob trap instead), and in multiplayer, difficulty by other players attempting to locate the home.

### Overhang Bases
There are 3 types of overhang base. The first is built into the underside of overhangs of mountains. Unfortunately, suitable overhangs and ones located in scenic or easy-to-defend places can be difficult to find. Building is another problem, as you would either have to pillar upwards to excavate the home or enter from the top and use water to build on the underside of the overhang. Sand or gravel is recommended, as removing pillars made out of these materials is much easier and can be done directly from the ground.

The second type is built by making walls that go from the ground to the top of the overhang. You can put in many floors and have tons of stuff. You can also connect it to a hollowed-out mountain for even more space. The third is to find a wall (a ravine, maybe?) and make there your base as an overhang.

As difficult as this setup may be, one can use this type of base as a stealthy reconnaissance outpost, by dropping lava, arrows, or even TNT on unsuspecting players or just for viewing epic scenery.
