## Java Edition
Chunk colormap of seed 0.
The loading screen in Java Edition shows a chunk colormap, which is a square that visualizes the rendering of 43 by 43 chunks (688 by 688 blocks). It populates with colored pixels that change color and expand as chunks load. Each pixel represents a chunk, and the color represents the chunk status. It had a dirt background in world generation until snapshot 24w09a, when it was replaced with a blurred view of the panorama.
