# Tutorials/Time-saving tips
Minecraft contains a mixture of interesting things to do and routine operations such as resource collection, which can get dull and repetitive. But tastes differ, and different players view different parts of the game as the dull parts. This page collates a wide variety of time-saving tips for all aspects of the game.

## In-game Tips
### Automation
Automating operations is by far the biggest in-game time saver. Mob grinders, item generators, experience farms, automatic smelting system and so on may require significant setup time, but this is soon repaid in the time savings they can provide. These automatic systems have their own tutorials, and so those details are not listed here.

### Beds
Whenever you are active above ground (especially when away from your base mapping or otherwise covering long distances), it's worth carrying a bed with you. When it starts getting dark, place the bed and sleep. Skipping the nighttime provides a significant speed-up, and is safer. It also resets your spawn (unless you play on Hardcore). Mobs spawned at night are likely to disturb and interrupt you (including killing you!), and you might overlook something important in the dark. You may be worried about mobs attacking if you place the bed outside a shelter, but if you go to bed early enough, the light level prevents them from spawning at all, giving you a creeper-free day! Phantoms also don't attack you when you are well-rested.

Warning: If you take the bed with you, getting killed during the day returns you to the world's spawn point.

### Block off exhausted mine sections
It's easy to get temporarily lost underground, and to waste time wandering into areas of your mine that you have already cleared. By blocking off completed mine sections, you avoid accidentally wandering into them again. Ideally, use glass, fence, or leaves. This allows you to see into the area, and spot any mobs that may appear (indicating either inadequate lighting or possibly a section you have overlooked). In particular, try using only materials not found naturally underground (cobblestone is close to ideal), as you may not be able to tell if the blocked area was blocked off by you or if the apparent barrier is just naturally spawned. You can also use signs to mark off finished areas. Another good idea is to create a unique shape out of the blocks unlikely to generate naturally. In that case, you can use materials found underground.

### Block off water channels
Whenever you have water and redstone circuits close together, and you are at risk of removing the wrong block and starting a flood, protect the redstone by placing doors or other blocks that cannot be waterlogged at key points. This should interrupt the water flow and prevent it from washing over your circuits. ‌[Java Edition  only] Another alternative is to place one-block deep sinkholes to limit the water's spread. Either method saves time recreating your circuitry in the event of a flood.

### Bone meal
- Once the player has obtained all the desireddyecolors, and tamed all the wolves you want (tip: just tame two wolves and breed them infinitely),bonesandbone mealhave just two remaining uses: craftingbone blocksand rapidly growing plants. By all means, keep back a few spare bones in case you need them, but you should try to use the remainder. Sown on bare grass blocks, bone meal produces long grass, from which you can collect a few seeds to start a wheat farm. About 6–8 doses of bone meal can convert a single block of planted wheat seed into enough wheat for a loaf of bread – useful for emergency food.
- The player can also use bone meal to convert a brown and a red mushroom into two giant mushrooms, and by harvesting these, you can easily gain a dozen meals' worth of mushroom stew. Even after its effectiveness was reduced (by about 50–70%) in the 1.5 update, bone meal still quickly grows trees, pumpkins, melons, carrots, and potato plants to full size. Don't waste time waiting for your first few plants to grow; dose them with bone meal, and then you can start harvesting much more quickly.

Tip:Growing giant mushrooms above ground can be tricky, because mushrooms cannot be planted (and uproots after a short time) if the sunlight level is too high. A workaround is to use a few dirt blocks to make a dark hole shielded from direct sunlight, place an ordinary mushroom inside the hole. Then quickly remove the dirt and apply bone meal before the mushroom has time to uproot.
- Bone meal can be created by filling a composter with plant material. This process can be automated by adding a hopper above and below the composter, feeding in seeds and pulling out bone meal. This process can be automated with a farm and a hopper above the composter for input and one beneath it for output
- You can also make a skeleton farm to get bones and craft them into bone meal
