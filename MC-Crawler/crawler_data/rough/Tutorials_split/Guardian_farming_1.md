### Transport and killing
The simplest design is to leave a large room below the spawning pool. Guardians cannot also be easily transported by flowing water, so the usual canal or flowing-pool designs will not be ideal to collect them into a central area for more concentrated killing. They have pathing that allows them to swim against the flow of water.

While manual kill designs are possible, keep in mind that the Guardians' natural thorns damage will damage players using swords rather than arrows or damaging potions, and that guardians can fit through 1-block holes (thus attacking from above or around a slab or other small gap is needed to prevent escapees). A manual-kill Guardian farm should thus provide for healing, either a beacon providing regeneration or potions. Having a health of 30 × 15, Guardians will require a 34-block drop to kill. Lava over a 12-block drop is sufficient to kill with a combination of fall, lava, and fire damage.

Iron golem kill designs do work, but are limited in usefulness as the guardians' thorns effect will eventually kill the golems, requiring regular replacements. This makes such a method very difficult to maintain without an iron farm. 

Suffocation traps are possible, however, guardians may phase out through corners. To prevent this, add extra blocks to the corner.

It is possible to use full-stand conduits to kill guardians, however, the guardian must be 8 blocks from the conduit itself, and the conduit must be in the water, making it possibly hard to collect drops.

Lit campfires can also be used to kill guardians, with hoppers placed under them to collect the dropped items.

### Item collection and waiting
Guardian farms present few unique issues concerning item collection and player waiting areas: hoppers or minecart with hopper systems work well for collection, and except for manual-kill concerns mentioned above nothing special is required for a player waiting area.

## Designs
### Manual farms
#### Guardian Chamber
This design transports guardians to a collection pit, where they are then damaged with splash poison and instant damage potions.
You can then collect the drops, either by hand or hopper.

#### Guardian Drop
Guardians get transported up with soulsand in 2 boxes of 9 by 12 blocks 10 blocks apart to a general drop which drops them down. 

It can be automatic so they die of fall damage or you can flick a lever so they get captured by the water and can get killed by hand for xp.

### Automatic farms
No Drain Guardian Farms

Many farms Pre-Update Aquatic require you to drain the monument before making your farm.

Since 1.13 you can now avoid draining. An example is here:


These No Drain Guardian farms are time efficient as they use the new 1.13 mechanics of soul sand to launch guardians upwards into a chamber that then directs them in various ways to a kill chamber, often using both lava and gravity. The size of the soul sand section can vary from just a small square to the full 56×56 area of the monument, with the bigger area giving greater drops and yields. The area from the monument floor to the surface must be completely clear to avoid any blocking of the guardians' ascent to the chamber which is often situated at the ocean surface. Note that large blocks of bubble columns can massively lower your FPS unless particles are set to minimal.

#### Iron Golems
One of them is the iron golem method, where guardians spawn and are funneled using water currents to a trench filled with iron golems. As the iron golems attack the guardians, the drops are collected using hoppers and deposited in chests. This method is fairly iron-heavy, due to all of the iron golems, which will need to be periodically replaced due to the guardian's spike damage, and a large number of hoppers used.

#### Super-efficient farm
Another farm is the 'OP', or super-efficient farm. This farm is very expensive to build in Survival mode, due to the number of materials used, but produces over 100,000 items per hour.




#### Minecarts
Similar to the iron golem-based farm, except there is a drop down to bedrock instead of hoppers, some lava near the bottom to ensure no guardians are still alive, and a minecart with hopper to collect the drops. An estimated raw resource count is:

- 200+ solid blocks
- 6.5 stacks of wood logs
- 80 iron ingots
- 6+ gold ingots
- 55 redstone
- 12 diamonds (for pickaxes)
- 1+ sand (for glass)

- 1. Build an iron golem-based farm without hoppers or golems (see above).
- 2. Dig the central canal down to bedrock.
- 3. Place down rails covering the canal, with powered rails every 20 blocks (recommended, although you could have up to 50 blocks spacing).
- 4. Place redstone blocks under every powered rail except one (near a wall), then carve out a small room near the rail without power.
- 5. Place a lever next to the unpowered rail, and a hopper underneath. Place 2 chests next to the hopper, make sure they are connected to the hopper. The lever should connect to the rail.
- 6. Place some glass overlooking the rails, place down the minecart with hopper, and you are done. For more storage, place down more hoppers and chests.

### Conduits
A simple farm that uses a conduit to kill guardians, which allows spawning and killing to be done in the same room.

- Drain the temple
- Create a large, flat room
- Put a single layer of water over every block in the room, flowing to a single point to be optimal
- Put a hopper at the point(s) that the water flows to, connected to a storage system
- Activate a conduit directly underneath the center of the room. if there are no hoppers there and the floor is made ofprismarine, the floor could be used as the top of the activation frame
