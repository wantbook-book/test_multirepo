#### Killing sheep for wool when the player has enough iron for shears
Sheep can only drop one block of wool when the player kills them. If the player has shears, they can right-click on a sheep with shears, yielding one to three blocks of wool. Also, if the player right-clicks a sheep with a dye in their hand, the color of the sheep changes to that color. If that same sheep is sheared then eats grass to re-grow their wool, it has the same color of wool as the player dyed it earlier. This makes wool of any color renewable. Baby sheep cannot be sheared and do not drop anything when killed.

If the player plans on killing a sheep, they should shear the sheep first before killing them, as it increases the wool gathered before the player kills the sheep for experience points and mutton. Also, the only essential use for wool is a bed, so the player should avoid killing more than enough sheep to collect the wool needed to make a bed on their first few days.

#### Shearing mooshrooms
Mooshrooms drop 5 mushrooms of their color when sheared, turning them into cows. However, the player can get infinite mushroom stew out of them by right-clicking them with a bowl, meaning "milking" them with a bowl is more efficient. In addition, mooshrooms never grow back their mushrooms when sheared so the player needs to find another one in a mushroom fields biome. If the player has enough mooshrooms to breed them, then shearing extra mooshrooms could be used to get cows and mushrooms. However, if the player plans on killing the mooshroom for beef or leather, then it is okay to shear them beforehand if the player needs mushrooms, as killed mooshrooms do not drop any mushrooms.

#### Breaking spawners or budding amethyst


When in a monster room, mineshaft or nether fortress, don't try to break any spawners, with the exception of the silverfish spawner found in the stronghold. A spawner drops only 50 experience points when broken, but a working spawner can be used for mob farms to gain more experience and rare drops. The spawner should simply be disabled by placing a torch on one side, except for blaze spawners, which require many torches within a couple of blocks of it.  An exception may be the stronghold since it may be annoying to try to set up a silverfish farm and the player may wish to just get experience other ways.

While there were historically different ways to obtain spawners as items legitimately in Survival, the majority of players create worlds in much newer versions, and as such, actually obtaining a spawner by breaking it is no longer possible in said new versions.

For a similar reason, avoid breaking budding amethyst blocks, as their supply is similarly limited and does not even drop anything when broken.

#### Using torches to break anvils
Many players use torches to break gravel after having built a large tower of it. Unlike gravel, sand, and the dragon egg, if anvils fall on torches, the torch is destroyed without dropping itself as an item, and an anvil falling on a player deals damage. Use different non-solid blocks such as slabs, signs, cakes, and soul sand to break anvils, all of which cause the anvil to drop as an item.

#### Breaking bookshelves repeatedly without Silk touch
If the player needs to move bookshelves, they should use a Silk Touch enchanted tool to do so. Breaking a bookcase normally yields 3 books, which results in the player losing 6 wooden planks (this can add up quickly). Using a Silk Touch-enchanted tool gives the player the actual block back, saving resources and time.

Woodland mansion libraries generate lots of bookshelves, so ignore them until you have a silk touch tool.

#### Destroying ender chests without Silk Touch
Ender chests drop only eight obsidian blocks when destroyed, meaning that the player loses an eye of ender. Ender chests never lose their items, as all ender chests are linked for each player. To avoid wasting eyes of ender, a player should use a Silk Touch pickaxe so the ender chest drops as an item instead of eight obsidian blocks.

#### Destroying glass without Silk Touch
Glass does not drop itself when broken unless the player uses a tool enchanted with Silk Touch. Thus, players should be careful where they put glass, because if placed it in the wrong place and broken, it cannot be recovered. For this same reason, the player should also avoid holding glass in the hotbar, unless they plan to use it soon. This same advice is recommended for glass panes and glowstone. 

#### 
Do not shoot these items. They count as entities, and as such, they can be hit off walls by arrows, using the arrow in the process. In fact, an armor stand is destroyed and does not drop as an item if shot. If the player wants to practice archery, the player should shoot somewhere else. A target block is a much better option as it does not consume an arrow and can be linked to a redstone comparator to show more precise accuracy. A button made of wood can also serve as a nice and cheap target if the player does not have the resources to craft a target block. Stone buttons also work, but it's better to use the stone for something else unless you have a lot of stone.

#### Exposing armor stands to creepers
Creepers explode when close to the player, and if armor stands are destroyed in the explosion, they do not drop as an item. Therefore, it is important to keep armor stands away from creepers, preferably inside, far away from any mobs.

Try to drive the creeper away or kill it before it explodes to prevent any entity loss.

#### Curing zombie villagers near zombies
If the player cures a zombie villager when other zombies are around, the other zombies attack the cured villager, reversing what the player just did. Even if the cured zombie is safe from zombie attacks, it takes longer to be cured, so zombie villagers should be kept away from zombies as they are being cured. Also, this wastes golden apples and potions of weakness, losing gold and other valuable materials.

This also applies for illagers, because they attack villagers and not zombie villagers.
