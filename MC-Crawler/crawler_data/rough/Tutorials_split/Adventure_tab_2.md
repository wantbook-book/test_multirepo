Free fall from the top of the world (build limit) to the bottom of the world and survive

Requirements: Fall from at least Y=319 to at most Y=-59 with a vertical distance of greater than 379 blocks and survive.

There are at least two methods to do this. The usual way, accessible even in early game, involves creating a tall pillar all the way to the build limit, and a shaft straight down to the bedrock layer right next to it.

Step 1: Shaft
Prepare a water bucket, 6 stacks of scaffolding (if you don't have easy access to bamboo, you can use 6 stacks of any other blocks), 1 trapdoor and a good pickaxe.

Go to the bottom of the Overworld. The highest layer with bedrock generates at Y=-60; you need to find a block of bedrock at least 2 layers deeper, at Y=-62, that can be accessed from above. Place a water bucket on top of that bedrock, so you can survive your jump. Write down X and Z coordinates of this block (use the debug screen to see those). If you are in a cold biome, you should place a light source next to the water, so it doesn't turn into ice.

Next, go to the surface on the corresponding coordinates, and dig 1×2 shaft all the way down to that block of bedrock: one column is for the jump, and the other is for going back up. If you find lava on the way down, it might be a good idea to choose a different spot for this advancement.

A very unlikely but possible scenario includes encountering an amethyst geode in your shaft. Remember that budding amethyst blocks grow amethyst clusters on their side, potentially blocking the drop, so make sure that no budding amethyst is present in the shaft.

Step 2: Pillar
Create a pillar of scaffolding in the second column. You can simply place the first scaffolding and keep clicking (use) on the side, until you see a message "Height limit for building is 319". This means that pillar has reached build limit.

Bottom chamber of the setup.
You can then walk inside of the scaffolding and hold jump to go all the way to build limit. Scaffolding is the best block for such a pillar, but you could also use ladders or just simply pillar up with normal blocks. Next, on top of your pillar, remove one scaffolding block and place four solid blocks and a trapdoor like so:

Top section of the setup.
Trapdoor should be directly above the target water source block at the bottom. Make sure it is at correct coordinates, as you will most likely die from falling if you miss the jump!

Step 3: The jump
Stand on top of the trapdoor and use it: you will start falling. Don't move! It takes about 8 seconds to reach bedrock from build limit. If you did everything correctly, you will hit the water placed in step 1 and get the advancement. You can then use your scaffolding pillar to get back out.

Endgame method
Alternatively, you can do this much faster if you have access to end-game items: elytra and totems of undying. Starting from any point on the surface, simply dig a shaft to bedrock: this can be even the highest layer of bedrock at Y = -60. Equip a totem in your off-hand. Next, point straight up (very important: you must point exactly 90 degrees upwards!). To verify you are pointing exactly up, see your coordinates—this is the last value in the row starting with "facing" in the debug screen. Enter flying mode with your elytra and, using fireworks, fly out of the shaft. Do not move your mouse! When you pass height 320, stop using fireworks. You will slow down and eventually fall back into the shaft. Again, it is very important that you don't move at all during the flight and fall. If you did everything correctly, you will hit bedrock at the bottom few seconds later, using up your totem and granting the advancement.

## Respecting the Remnants
Brush a Suspicious block to obtain a Pottery Sherd

Requirements: Brush suspicious sand or suspicious gravel and obtain a pottery sherd.

First, you need to make a brush:

| Ingredients                          | Crafting recipe |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Feather+<br/>Copper Ingot+<br/>Stick |                 |

Next, find any structure that has naturally-generated suspicious sand or suspicious gravel in it, and use a brush on that block. Repeat until one of these suspicious blocks drops a pottery sherd.

Despite being relatively simple to achieve, actual requirement for this advancement is rather complicated. You need to meet two criteria, in any order: 1) have a sherd in your inventory, and 2) start brushing a suspicious block that has its LootTable property set to one of the naturally-generating values (ocean_ruin_cold, desert_well, trail_ruins_rare, trail_ruins_common, desert_pyramid, ocean_ruin_warm). 

This means that you can't get the advancement from a block that was already touched by another player, even if it still has a sherd inside. It also means that you can get it from a block that doesn't have a sherd, if you were given the sherd by another player.

As soon as both criteria are met, you will get the advancement.

## Sneak 100
Sneak near a Sculk Sensor or Warden to prevent it from detecting you

Requirements: Sneak within 8 blocks from a sculk sensor, or 16 blocks from a warden.

It is recommended to do this with a sculk sensor rather than a warden. Sculk sensors, along with other sculk-related blocks, can be found in deep dark biomes, which generate deep underground. Simply sneak while being near one: this grants you the advancement and prevents the sensor from detecting you.

Be warned that deep dark is a very dangerous and scary place! If you want to know more about it, go to the "deep dark" page.

## Sweet Dreams
Sleep in a bed to change your respawn point

Requirements: Sleep in a bed.

Only perform this while in the Overworld. If you try to sleep in the Nether or the End, the bed will explode!

First, get a bed. It can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients                 | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| MatchingWool+<br/>AnyPlanks |                 |

Wool can be obtained either from killing or shearing a sheep, or crafted from 4 pieces of string. 

You can also find beds in villages and igloos, or buy them from shepherd villagers.

Place the bed down and sleep in it by using it. 4 criteria must be met to do that:

- there are no monsters near the bed;
- bed is not obstructed, meaning that two spaces above it are empty;
- you are within 2 blocks of the bed;
- it is eithernightor athunderstorm.

Sleeping in a bed will grant you the advancement and reset your spawn point, so that when you die, you will respawn next to your bed.
