#### Cons
- Living in this biome without items from the Overworld is brutal.
- To get to the outer islands, the player must either bridge to them, use aflying machine, or kill theender dragonand get into theend gateway, either by using anender pearlor placingwaterandswimminginto the gateway.
- The player may end up falling into theVoid, meaning the player loses all items and experience. This danger is especially high on bridges that are 1 block wide or have no railing.
- Once the outer islands are reached, the player should head to an end city for tools. These structures are quite dangerous due to theshulkermobs scattered about. Given that the only thing the player is armed with at this point is ender pearls and chorus fruit, the challenge comes with making it to the chests at the top of the towers/the end ship without being able to kill shulkers efficiently. While the towers are designed so that all areas can be reached by foot, albeit requiring parkour while under attack from shulkers, with the exception of the ship, the shulker bullets are difficult to avoid. A few ideas include using the shulker's bullets to your advantage to levitate upward, although it requires the consumption of chorus fruit to keep your health up, which may teleport you back down a few blocks. You could use the chorus fruit as well, in hopes that it progressively teleports you upward. The best strategy is likely using ender pearls, although you need many, which requires a lot of bare-handed enderman farming.
- Crossing to other islands can be achieved by either: throwing ender pearls or making bridges of chorus plant blocks. Once the player loots an end city, they could build block bridges or use elytra.
- Endermen are everywhere and deadly to an unarmed player, so keep your head down and avoid eye contact.
- The player might have to use many ender pearls, which can occasionally spawnendermites. While weak, they attract enderman which can teleport or walk in front of the player's vision.

#### Useful resources
End stone, purpur, shulker shells, shulker boxes, ender pearls, end city loot, elytra, chorus fruit, chorus flowers and ender chests are useful resources found on the outer islands.

## Other
While not technically biomes, these areas offer different base building experiences than any biome and may be desirable to some players.

### Sky
Building high above the surface can be challenging, as there is a constant danger of falling, and the player must set up farms to sustain themselves without taking trips to the surface. However, building a skybase can allow the player lots of creative freedom without any land to get in their way.

- The vast areas between islands in the End is similar to living in the sky in the Overworld, with the added Con of it naturally being dark at all times and endermen spawning frequently.

#### Pros
- At this height, it isn't too difficult to light up a sky base, the only place where hostile mobs could spawn and attack.Phantomsare the sole exception, spawning in the air regardless of light level, but they can be avoided by sleeping frequently.
- Depending on your render distance and height, you may be able to see the surface which provides a nice aerial view.
- With no land obstructions, the player can exercise complete creative freedom, and have plenty of space for any structure.
- A sky base is perfect for factions or anarchy servers. With only mild protection, it could be impenetrable.

#### Cons
- There are absolutely no natural resources in the sky (with the exception ofsnowfallcreating snow layers in some biome's skies, andrainfallfillingcauldronswith water in some other's). The player must make cargo trips from the surface during building their sky base to bring up necessary resources and farmables.
- Constant danger of falling off if not careful, likely from a lethal height.
- Unless the player intents to live on their sky base 100%, a way of getting up and down to the surface is necessary, such as a long ladder.

### Underground
As an opposite to the sky, the underground may require the player to spend lots of time mining out space for structures. Any room or cave near the player's base should be lit up sufficiently to prevent mob spawning, however, a wandering trader along with two trader llamas can also spawn underground. However, the player would be living right next to a vast amount of resources such as iron, diamond, and more. While likely less desirable than living on the surface, living in the underground can provide a unique survival experience.

#### Pros
- Immediate access to the underground's vast mining resources.
- Plenty of stone, dirt, ores, etc.
- A cave, especially one that is big and/or opens up at the surface, can be transformed into an improvised home.
- The player may find structures like strongholds or mineshafts suitable to easily change into a home.
- Due to their trades, wandering traders that spawn underground can serve as underground shops for useful resources that would otherwise require the player to go to the surface.
- Perfect for a secret base/room.

#### Cons
- Many hazards such as hostile mobs in the dark, lava lakes, loose gravel that can create cave-ins, dungeons and other structures.
- Lots of mining may need to be done to clear out an area for a desired structure.
- Many resources needed for ongoing survival such as wood and foods require the player either first bring them from the surface, or find a structure such as mineshafts or strongholds that provide such things, wandering trader may also solve the problem as long as the player has a large quantity of emeralds.

#### Useful resources
Stone, dirt, gravel, andesite, diorite, granite, iron, gold, redstone, lapis lazuli, diamonds, emeralds, obsidian, dungeon/mineshaft/stronghold loot and mob farming opportunities are useful resources found here.
