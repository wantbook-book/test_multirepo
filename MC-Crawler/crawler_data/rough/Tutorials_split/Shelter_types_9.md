### 
Materials

Basically the same as freestanding and many obsidian

Description

Same as freestanding, but more protective and can be used as a decoy for griefers. This still retains the classic beauty of freestanding shelter. If you want to make this as your permanent shelter, consider adding some defense around the house.

Pros

- Still retains the classic beauty of freestanding shelter.
- More protection.
- Can be used to teach a lesson togriefers.

Cons

- Bulkier than normal freestanding shelter.
- Difficult to get theobsidian.

Location

An open field or places that can easily attract griefers (for griefers decoy)

Construction

For the basics, it's the same as the freestanding. For additional protection, place the obsidian as the base wall. Then, cover the outer part with wooden planks or dirt (for attracting griefers to burn it or exploding it). For the inner part, you can either use planks or any other blocks. Don't forget to cover the exposed obsidian as it could alert griefers of your trap or reduce the beauty of your house.

Extras

- Furniture.
- An anti-griefingtrap.
- Secret storage room or safe-room (must NOT be inside or near the house).
- Redstone trap to teach griefers a lesson.

### Two-Story House
Materials

About 6 stacks of wood, 28 cobblestone and plenty of torches. 

Description

A basic two-story house that has a deck. It provides protection, and the bed is on the second floor.

Location

A flat area.

Construction

Make a 6×6 foundation and fill it with wooden planks. Then, make a simple frame for the first floor with wooden planks and cobblestone on the edges of the walls. Add 2×2 holes in the center of each wall for the windows, but leave the front open with a 2×2 hole for the 2 doors. Do the same thing that you did for the first floor, but put a single door on the left side of the front of the house on the second floor. Then, add a 6×3 deck off of the front of the second floor. Add a railing and supports to the deck using fence blocks. Now, make a staircase to the second floor to the right of the door if you're looking at the doors from the inside. Adding torches is obviously recommended. If you want a bigger house, it is highly recommended to build a 7×7. Just follow the steps giving to you earlier.

Extras

- A basement.
- A fireplace inside with iron bars around it.
- Redstone lamps

### Hollowed-Out Mountain
Materials

- Pickaxes
- Shovel (for any dirt/gravel you come across)
- At least 16 torches

Description

The title says it all: a mountain, preferably not too big, hollowed out and converted into a shelter! Good protection, as watchtowers and a moat can easily be added after making a basic shelter within the mountain.

Location

A small, freestanding mountain, not part of a large mountain range, preferably 25-40 blocks tall. A good advantage is that as you build, you are gaining material, and not losing. Time: 1–2 days.

Construction

Find a mountain that matches the description above. Bring along a pickaxe or two, depending on its size. Hollow out the entire mountain, add a staircase/ladders and some floors, and you are ready to begin customizing!

Extras

- Wooden bridge connection to other nearby mountains
- Greenhouse
- Trapdoor drawbridge
- Armory
- Watchtowers
- A castle on top to get rid of all the cobblestone from hollowing out the inside of the mountain

### Floating
Materials

- Plenty (at least 200) of cobble, planks, or other general building material
- At minimum, 1 door
- Other material needed for house additions

Description

A house that floats in mid-air! Protects greatly, as mobs can't get in and spiders have nothing to climb on. However, it can take a bit longer to start building than freestanding structures, about 1–3 days.

Location

A cliff face, preferably over water, is the best place to build the structure. Any large hill is a good starting point (this option is assumed for the construction section). With more work, however, it can be built anywhere, using a staircase or water elevator for access.

Construction

1. Choose an elevation. The recommended height is over 10 blocks.
2. Build a 1-block wide bridge out about 5 blocks from the hill, beginning the count from the furthest horizontal point on the hill within 3 blocks in any direction.
3. If you want a house below the level of your bridge (a basement, perhaps), make a pillar from the ground up to the desired lowest elevation. Build around it to the desired foundation size. Remove the pillar when the construction of the foundation is completed.
4. From this base, build, as usual, making sure to place a door at the level of the bridge, with an empty space above it so you can jump to and from the door. Don't forget you are still vulnerable to roof spawning if precautions aren't taken!
5. Make a one or two block gap between the bridge and the door. This is the system that so secures the structure. Mobs coming to you will simply fall below if they attempt to reach you when the door is closed. It is unlikely that they would jump the pit, but it is still a possibility. If you want mobs to fall into a pit, place a sign on the block you would jump from to your door on the side facing towards the door and they will think it is another block and walk onto it.

- Continue building. One great thing about this type of shelter is that you aren't nearly as hemmed in by hills or other terrains! Generally, you can build in any direction for a great distance. The only concern is that you must build the new foundations, and therefore must use a few more materials.

Notes

You may have some trouble getting into your house. One thing to make sure of is the door. Since the hinge area is solid even when open, you should jump to the door from the side opposite the hinge. Simply widen the bridge at the end to do so more easily. The area under the pit should ideally have some sort of fall-breaker in case misjudgment of the jump occurs. Once you are confident you can jump it consistently, you can build a mob trap for anything that approaches. Make sure that you can escape it if you DO fall, however.

Extras:

These will be the same as a normal house- except anything to do with the underground. Just build that sort of structure on the area opposite the bridge/stairs. Even grass can be brought up with a stair of dirt. Do not use a full stair with lower support, as to prevent intrusion while you wait for the spread. You can also add nether portals for easy transport up and down. If you do, make sure to block it off or hide it so griefers and ghasts can't get to it.

Also, when playing multiplayer, cover the outside of the floor with white wool or possibly quartz. People that will look up at it will think that's it's a cloud! And you don't have to worry about griefers! Another way to conceal a sky base is to make it out of chests and trapped chests and place blocks temporarily because chestlike blocks don't render far away from players
