### The End platform
When using an End portal to travel to the End, a 5×5 platform of obsidian is generated. If the platform is damaged or destroyed, it will be restored. However, getting back requires either having killed the ender dragon or killing yourself.

### The End spikes
The end spikes in the End may be mined for obsidian. They are renewable since they regenerate when the ender dragon is respawned. These towers extend quite high and reach down to y=0. This requires being able to handle the Ender Dragon, however.

## Automatic farming
The biggest problem with obsidian mining is the time it takes; even with the best pickaxe and effects, it takes 1.6 seconds to mine a single block. Various methods can be used to break obsidian blocks automatically. In Java Edition, the wither is usually key in these methods as it is capable of breaking obsidian blocks with its attacks. In Bedrock Edition, piglin bartering is the only reliable and stable way of getting a lot of obsidian automatically.[1]

### Nether portals

  

This tutorial is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


By caging the wither in the Overworld and putting the player in a teleport loop through portals, a Nether portal is repeatedly generated and destroyed.

By caging the wither using some clever boat placement and indestructible ender crystals, the wither is caged to trap the wither on top of the end platform. [verify]

### End spikes

  

This tutorial is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


A lesser used method of farming obsidian is by caging withers in the lower part of the eastern End spike, causing the withers to blow up the pillar when regenerated, wielding up to 600,000 obsidian per hour when using the pillar completely. Only the lower part of the pillar can be used as the higher part generates air blocks around itself when regenerating, this would cause the withers to escape. After the withers are trapped inside the pillar, the ender dragon summoning ritual is started, causing the pillars to regenerate. The ritual is either aborted before the ender dragon respawns or the ender dragon is killed by a specialized contraption such as a railgun. Such a design is shown by cubicmetre.

### Outdated design

  

This tutorial is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


One of the first designs used the wither to break portions of the 5×5 obsidian spawn platform in the End, and regenerating it with a sand generator that pushed sand through the end portal situated in the Overworld. This method was patched however when the wither was made to shoot blue skulls that were capable of breaking any block. As such, this method works only in Minecraft 12w36a and several earlier versions. The following video is an explanation of how this method works.

### Piglin Bartering
Linking a zombified piglin gold farm to a piglin bartering farm gives you lots of loot from bartering, such as nether quartz, gravel, Soul Speed enchanted books and iron boots, iron nuggets, and obsidian, along with many others. You can get a full double chest of obsidian after an overnight AFK session. If one's gold farm is in the nether, it can be linked with a piglin bartering farm fairly easily. If instead, you want to build your gold farm in the Overworld powered by nether portals, you might want to consider getting obsidian in another way first, such as other methods shown on this page, then you can switch to piglin bartering.
