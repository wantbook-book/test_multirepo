## Minecraft
The heart and story of the game

Requirements: Have a crafting table in your inventory.

Get a crafting table in your inventory to obtain this advancement. First, hold down the attack on a log until it breaks, then collect the dropped block by walking over it. Logs are part of trees, which are very easy to find (as long as you didn't start out in a biome like ocean or desert). Just look around when you spawn.

Then, open your inventory. You will see a 2×2 grid near the top right-hand corner; place your wood log in any of the slots. Click on the planks that appear to obtain them.

If you turned on a bonus chest when you created your world, there is a good chance that it will contain logs, planks, or both. If you have these, you probably won't need to get any wood to create a crafting table.

Finally, put one of the four planks you got into each container of your grid (a 2×2 square of planks). You can use to place a single plank into the grid, instead of all four.


Once you have the crafting table in your inventory, you will get the advancement.

## Stone Age
Mine stone with your new pickaxe

Requirements: Have cobblestone, cobbled deepslate or blackstone in your inventory.

First, place your crafting table on the ground by holding the crafting table in your hand and use the ground. Follow the crafting recipe below to make sticks (note that this can also be done in the 2×2 crafting grid in your inventory):

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| AnyPlanks   | 4               |

Now arrange your sticks and some planks in the crafting table to make a wooden pickaxe. You may need to get more wood in order to have enough to make a wooden pickaxe.

| Ingredients          | Crafting recipe |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| AnyPlanks+<br/>Stick |                 |

Next, you must find stone, and mine it with your wooden pickaxe to get cobblestone (stone will become cobblestone if you mine it with a normal pickaxe, without the Silk Touch enchantment). Exposed stone can be found on the sides of hills and in ravines/caves. If you find a cave or ravine, be wary of any hostile mobs (such as zombies and skeletons) that might be inside.

If you are in the Nether or below Y=8, you can also mine blackstone or deepslate to get this advancement, although the chances of you getting to the Nether or finding a deepslate blob without picking up any cobblestone are very slim. Blackstone is commonly found in the basalt deltas biome. You may also find blackstone in other biomes near the lava sea.

## Getting an Upgrade
Construct a better pickaxe

Requirements: Have a stone pickaxe in your inventory.

You need to make a stone pickaxe. Using your wooden pickaxe, mine three stone blocks so you have three cobblestone blocks (again, as in Stone Age, you can use cobbled deepslate or blackstone for this).

Now arrange your sticks and cobblestone/blackstone/deepslate blocks in the crafting table to make a stone pickaxe:

| Ingredients                    | Crafting recipe |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| Anystone-tier block+<br/>Stick |                 |

Stone pickaxe also can spawn in the bonus chest, be bought from novice-level toolsmith villagers, or obtained through toolsmith villager gifts.

Parent of: Acquire Hardware

## Acquire Hardware
Smelt an iron ingot

Requirements: Have an iron ingot in your inventory.

The intended method for getting iron ingots is to find iron ore. It is found at almost any height in the Overworld, except layers 73 to 79; it is most common at Y = 16, but it can also be easily found in mountains if they are nearby. The two main ways to find iron ore are to find it in a cave, or to find it in an exposed stone surface either on the ground or in the side of a hill/mountain. Because caves often have monsters in them, they are not recommended to go into until you have some armor and weapons, so finding an exposed surface in the ground with iron in it is much safer. If there are no caves or exposed stone surfaces near you, you could start a mineshaft. If you are feeling very daring and adventurous, make a stone sword and a few torches, and search a cave. You can usually find iron in caves very quickly, because walls of caves will expose a lot of blocks.

Once you find iron ore, mine it with your stone pickaxe (don't mine it with a wooden pickaxe, it won't drop anything). It will drop raw iron (unless you mined it with the Silk Touch enchantment, in which case it will drop an iron ore).

Then make a furnace using cobblestone, blackstone or cobbled deepslate and put the raw iron or iron ore in it along with a fuel source, such as planks or coal. After 10 seconds, it yields an iron ingot.

If you are lucky, you can find iron ingots in chests in village blacksmiths, armorer's house or toolsmith's house; desert temples, dungeons, mineshafts, jungle pyramids, shipwrecks, buried treasures, pillager outposts, woodland mansions, strongholds, nether fortresses, bastions and end cities. 

Iron nuggets can also spawn in chests in ruined portals, bastions, shipwrecks, and village taiga houses. If you have 9 iron nuggets, you can turn them into 1 iron ingot.

|-------------|-----------------|
| Iron Nugget |                 |

Bastion chests can also generate a block of iron, which you can turn into 9 iron ingots.

| Ingredients   | Crafting recipe |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Block of Iron | 9               |

Iron golems can spawn in villages and pillager outposts. When killed, the golem drops 3-5 iron ingots. Note that an iron golem on any difficulty beyond Peaceful will fight back if you try to kill it, and it deals lots of damage, so this method is not recommended to inexperienced players. 

Zombies, husks and zombie villagers also have a chance to drop 1 iron ingot. Iron nuggets also can be obtained by smelting iron tools, weapons, armor, horse armor, or chainmail armor, and by bartering.

| Ingredients                                                                                                     | Smelting recipe |

You will get the advancement once you transfer the iron ingot to your inventory. Iron ingots can further be made into many useful tools, weapons, and armor.
