### Extreme Night Survival
Create a 500Ã—500 barrier cage. Position all the players. Have command blocks hooked to redstone clock to summon powerful monsters, such as vindicator with Sharpness V axe, zombie in full diamond armor, skeleton with Power V bow, charged creepers, etc. Summon an ender dragon or wither as well. Keep the map on adventure mode so people can't break the redstone.

Each player should have a full set of diamond armor, a diamond sword with Sharpness II, a bow with power II and Infinity, 64 steak, 10 golden apples, a water bucket, and 2 stacks of cobblestone.

The players should fight each other and the monsters. The last person alive gets to keep the players' equipment and mob drops.

## 12 Pyramids
Another idea for making a challenge map is something I like to call 12 Pyramids. Here is how to make this exciting new game

### Setup
First, you go to a random item generator that also gives blocks. Next, you create a superflat world and set the difficulty to Peaceful mode. Without this, mobs will spawn while the map is still under construction. Then set up a command block to give you infinite night vision for building in dark places. Next, go to your generator and select 15 items to generate. Click "Randomize". Write down those items. Or not if you are running the generator on a different device. Return to Minecraft, and give yourself one possible stack of each item you just wrote down. Ok, there should be plenty blocks in your invetory, and maybe even a consumable, armor, or tool. Go into survival mode, and use the items at your disposal to create a pyramid. Make sure to have rooms, halls and corridors, etc. This is ment to be like the Pyramids of Giza, or 12 or them. When you run out of placeable solid blocks, clear your invetory to make it easier and refill from the list. Make sure to put any non-placable items in any kind of storage system you get, for example, putting a wooden axe in a smoker would be good. Around the end level of each pyramid, go into creative mode and place a chain of command blocks that clear the player's invetory, teletorts him/her to the world spawn, and places a stone button at a spot. Save finishing the last command block for when you finish the next pyramid. Repeat this until you have a total of 12 pyramids, and have an iron door at the entrace of each one. This makes them have to do the map in order, but make sure you leave a stone button for them at the starting pyramid. And, if you are playing Java edition, you could make it so the world is a desert to add a theme to the pyramids. Shaders could make it look much better, however this will fry your Windows. Kinda sorta recommended. Use your interactable blocks wisely. For example, line some furnaces along a wall and hide a treasure somewhere in one. Or, if you have observers, pressure plates, dispensers and arrows, you could make a trap. Also make decorations, and if you have orange and purple terracotta, make a desert temple design. Avoid crafting anything whatsoever. You could make special rooms based on the materials you have, for example, turtle eggs could be used in a hatchery, armor stands on an armory, etc.

### Community
Now that you got the basics down, when you are done, set the default gamemode to Adventure, destroy the Night vision command block, set the difficulty to Normal (Or hard, for more of a better challenge, but not hardcore otherwise it might be a little too hard) and share it to the community!
