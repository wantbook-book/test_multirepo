## Organization
These shelters are organized by how long it would take to build them. Obviously, these can vary, depending on how detailed you make them. Material collection time counts too!

### Nomadic
The easiest type of shelter to build. These are generally the type you would build if you cannot find anything else, if you are nomadic, or if you're in an emergency. They are fragile and you shouldn't spend too many nights in them. They take a few minutes to make.

### Easy
These structures are a little bigger and more advanced than nomadic shelters. They offer some basic degree of protection. They may take a bit longer to make than Nomadic shelters.

### Medium
These are freestanding structures, capable of sustaining the player for extended periods. They offer a decent amount of protection. They take 1-3 Minecraft days to make. 

### Hard
These structures are often large and complicated in design and, as a result, can be time-consuming to make. However, they offer anywhere from a good degree to a great deal of protection. They take anywhere from a few Minecraft days to many days to make. 

### Extreme
This category of structures are renowned for being among the most complex and advanced constructions that a Survival mode player can afford and take a long time to build and can, therefore, be considered late-game buildings. The protection offered by these building complexes is second to none. They will take longer than Hard shelters and in some cases, you will spend in total a real-world day to create.

### Innovative
These structures focus more on feats of engineering rather than practicality and therefore offer relatively little protection relative to how challenging they are to build and many of them can even be dangerous to live in. They are, however, a sight worth looking at. These will take a varied amount of time to build, so you may not be ready to do these unless you have a large amount of time.

### Addons and renovations
While not full structures themselves, they are worth mentioning since they can be used to augment existing shelters.





















## Nomadic
### General tips
"Nomadic Shelters" are usually crude, primitive, and simple in design relative to other more advanced shelter types, often being the bare minimum of what qualifies as a shelter. They are, however, cheap and easy to build and can be constructed and set up almost anywhere, making them suitable shelters for use during the first, second and third days of Minecraft, for nomadic players or as an emergency fall-back solution in dire situations.

### Advantages
- Usually a portable shelter by design
- Easy to dismantle and rebuild
- Materials can be easily obtained and carried around

### Disadvantages
- Offers limited protection and is extremely vulnerable tocreeperattacks
- Many designs do not allow the player to easily tell when it is safe to go outside
- Usually vulnerable to spider attacks

### Tips
- Always have proper lighting
- Build basic fortifications (fences, walls, etc.) if necessary or desired
- Have a door and windows, if resources allow that
- Just because a nomadic shelter is crude, primitive and simple in design doesn't mean it cannot serve as the base and foundation for a more advanced shelter if the player, for example, decides to end their nomadic travel, settle down and adopt a more sedentary lifestyle.
