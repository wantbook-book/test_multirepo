### Killing meat animals
Several animals found wandering around will drop meat when they are killed, and if they are killed with fire they will drop cooked meat which is more nourishing.   Note that this includes salmon and cod, which are especially plentiful in rivers or oceans (but watch out for pufferfish). 

This list shows mobs, food from them when they are killed without fire and food from them when they are killed by fire: 

| Mob            | Food when they are killed without fire | Food when they are killed with fire |

Cooked foods have better saturation and restore more hunger than raw meat. Player can kill mobs with fire using Fire Aspect or Flame enchantments, flint and steel, fire charges, lava (although this may burn the items that are dropped from the mob) or some naturally generated fire in the Nether. Most fish can be tricky to set alight (being underwater) but sometimes it is actually possible.   While building a furnace is an option, if you only need to cook a few items you may be better off making a campfire.

### Looting a Village

See also: Village

Villages Offer many food sources: Depending on biome, most have hay bales lying around, which can be crafted into wheat, then bread (1 Hay Bale = 9 Wheat = 3 Bread = 15 ( × 7.5) food points). Those which don't have hay bales may have pumpkins or melons instead (see below). Their farms offer all four of the basic crops, and the chests in their houses can offer several food items. Some of the items found will be more nourishing if you can manage to cook them; the village may well have a furnace, smoker, or campfire for the purpose. Village farms have 25% to have wheat, beetroots, carrots and potatoes. A regular farm has 19 crops each, while a large farm has 38.

These food items can be found in the village chests:
