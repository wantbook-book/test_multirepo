Good combination of compact and fast.

### 
Stack up two horizontal pistons. Put a block next to the top one. Put a lever on this block. On Java Edition, you're done! On Bedrock Edition you need to add a piece of dust below the block, due to lack of quasiconnectivity.

Another version of a 1×2 piston door can be seen here:

Uses observer blocks for a design that can be easily scaled to any size up to 15 wide and 7 tall. The design is resource efficient enough to allow for the creation of larger doors even in survival mode.

### Piston lava door
A lava door that allows for safe entry to rooms without the player getting burnt, uses pistons, redstone and pressure plates to accomplish this!

### Flush Seamless piston door
This design is fully hidden, no pistons or redstone visible. Also, this design can be activated from both sides, and still, everything is hidden. The design isn't too complicated and doesn't take up a whole lot of resources either.

### Improved hidden piston door
The improved hidden piston door is a flush 2×2 door that can be opened through the use of a redstone torch on a wall. PearSquirrel improved this by compacting it and configuring it with pressure plates on the inside.

Smallest 3×3 piston door View at: Tutorials/Piston_uses/Smallest_3×3_piston_door [edit]
This is the smallest possible 3×3 seamless piston door, made by SacredRedstone. It has a size of 56 blocks.

### 
This is a piston door that cannot be seen on the outside, and no wiring/pistons are exposed when the door is open. The video below includes a demo and how to build it.

### Hidden door
For a door that is completely hidden except the lever/pressure plate/button to power it, you can use a hidden door. A tutorial for one can be found below.

|                               |

If you really want it to be invisible, remove the button or lever, and instead carry a redstone torch. Place it where the button was when you are ready to enter. It stays open until you exit but hey, who carries those things around randomly anyway?  

The button or lever can be hidden by putting it underground in a specific place, and it cannot be opened from the outside. An example of that is below.

## Structures
### Piston Draw Bridge
A redstone operated "Sticky Piston Draw Bridge" that can be used to cross a lava pit, it also acts as a moat as it can expand and contract to reveal or hide a secret path.

### Piston table
By placing an upward-facing piston on top of a redstone torch, one can easily and effectively create a 1×1 table.

An example of a piston table with chairs below!

### Scrolling display
This makes columns of blocks move in sync. Make two rows of a movable material (it cannot be longer than 12 blocks because the piston can move it only that far, but can be as tall as desired) and make your image or message built into it. Use pistons to move the blocks across, then back, the across the other way, back to the front/beginning.

### Garbage disposal
By placing a row of three cobble, then on top of it, cobblestone on the left one, and piston (facing right) on the middle one, nothing on the third one and a hole in the ground at the end, one could create a lava garbage disposal. After following those steps, put a lava bucket in the 2 block deep hole at the end, and place a button on the top left block. Unwanted blocks can be 'dropped', using the Q button (by default), onto the top middle block, then, after pushing the button the little blocks are pushed into the lava. This device does not destroy placed blocks, only dropped icons of blocks. While it does demonstrate concepts of using pistons, and looks cool, this device is not as practical as most other incinerators and garbage disposals, which are much simpler. For example, you could make a small pit of lava and drop items in it manually. After adding a trapdoor, it is a safe efficient way to dispose of unused items. You could also clear out a plus 2 blocks down. Put sand in the center place a cactus and trapdoor and one that if you fall in, you can save yourself.
