# Tutorials/Crop farming
Crop farming allows players to plant any of several vegetables and other crops on farmland, which then grow over time and can be harvested for food. This page covers four separate crops, all of which share essentially the same growth mechanics, though they produce different crops. All four seeds need to grow to maturity to produce more crops.

## Starting out
Each crop requires a seed for planting, and getting the first few can be non-trivial. After the first few seeds, or the first carrot or potato are planted, they eventually produce more seeds or vegetables than you started with. These can be used to replant, and plant more empty spots, until you've filled your farm.  All four crops provide food for the player, and also to breed various farm animals.  In addition to the sources listed below, all four crops can be found in village farms, and sometimes in village chests.

Players may want to set up a wheat farm early on, to provide bread as their first food supply; however, as the game progresses, better foods become available, and the wheat farm can be re-purposed for breeding animals. Carrots, potatoes, and beetroot are usually not found until somewhat later in the game. 

- Wheatis grown fromseeds, which can be collected by destroyinggrass. Each grass plant has only a1⁄8chance of dropping seeds. However, grass is common in most biomes, so gathering seeds is fairly easy. Harvesting a mature wheat plant yields 1 piece of wheat and 1-4 seeds. If harvested early, they drop a single seed, but no wheat. The wheat items can be crafted into bread, or combined with other items to makecake, orcookies.  The wheat itself can't be planted.
- Beetrootsare similarly grown frombeetroot seeds, each plant yielding one beetroot and 1-4 seeds.  The seeds can be found aschest loot. With acrafting tableand abowl, beetroots can be crafted intobeetroot soup, a more filling (but non-stackable) food item.  Beetroots can also be crafted intored dye.  As with wheat, beetroot items cannot be planted.
- Carrotsandpotatoesare their own seed, which is planted directly to grow more of the same.  Killedzombiesoccasionally drop a single carrot or potato (which you can cultivate and multiply into a farm's worth). Each mature plant can be harvested to get 1-4 potatoes or carrots respectively. (A potato plant also has an additional 2% chance of dropping a uselesspoisonous potato.) Both carrots and potatoes can be eaten directly, but can also be improved:
	- Potatoes can also becookedintobaked potatoesfor more nutrition.
	- Given some gold, carrots can be crafted intogolden carrots, one of the best foods in the game.



Crops can also be used to lure and breed various farm animals:  Wheat for cows and sheep (or the rare mooshrooms), seeds (any kind) for chickens, and any of carrots, (raw) potatoes or beetroots for pigs.  Carrots (or dandelions) can also be used for rabbits.

## Sowing
These crops can only be planted on farmland, which is produced by using a hoe on dirt or grass blocks. If there is no water nearby, farmland dries out and reverts to dirt, but only if there is no crop yet planted on it. The water can be a "still" source block, or flowing, but either needs to be within four blocks of the farmland horizontally, on the same vertical level or one level above.   If farmland becomes completely dry and a crop is planted on it, the farmland does not revert to dirt. Thus, it is possible to grow crops without water (say, in the Nether) by hoeing the dirt and immediately planting a crop. The farmland does not revert until after the crop is harvested, and even so that can generally be avoided by immediately replanting. Note, however, that this "dry farming" makes crops grow slowly.

At the beginning of the game when buckets are not available, you can till the dirt at the edge of a pond or lake or river, perhaps digging a trench to extend the water supply inland or straightening the shoreline by adding or removing dirt blocks at the top layer of the water's edge. However, once the player has a comfortable amount of resources, setting up some fenced farm plots prevents mobs from trampling the crops and attacking the farmer.

A basic repeatable farm plot consists of a 9×9 square of farmland with the center square dug out and filled with a water source block. This gives 80 blocks of farmland which can be fenced with 40 pieces of fence including gates and is the most efficient arrangement for simple farms. For larger farms, this plot can be repeated in both the X and Z directions.

Leaving the water source uncovered poses a risk of falling into it and then trampling some of the farmland when jumping out of it.  The water can be covered with any block, but using a slab, carpet, lily pad, or other block that can be walked onto without jumping is better to prevent trampling.  In modern versions of the game, you can also place a slab in the water block, providing a walkable surface with the farmland.   In cold biomes, covering the water with a solid block also guards it against freezing.  An alternative that also provides light so some crops can continue to grow at night is to suspend a block above the water with one space of air between them—so you can neither fall into the water nor jump on and off the block—and place torches on that block (or use a jack o'lantern or glowstone as the block).

Placing torches or other light sources near the crops allows them to continue growing at night or underground, and it prevents hostile mobs from spawning near them. Planting crops in alternate rows (that is, rows separated by bare farmland or a different crop) speeds up growth as well.
