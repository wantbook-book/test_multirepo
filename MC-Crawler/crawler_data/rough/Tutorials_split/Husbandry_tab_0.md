## Husbandry
The world is full of friends and food

Requirements: Eat any item that can be eaten.

Eat any type of food, other than a cake. It doesn't matter whether it's a pufferfish, a golden apple, or bread; as long as it is a type of food, you will get the advancement. Even drinks like potions and milk buckets count.

## Bee Our Guest
Use a Campfire to collect Honey from a Beehive using a Bottle without aggravating the bees

Requirements: Without provoking the bees, place a lit campfire under a beehive or bee nest, then harvest honey from it.

First, get a campfire. It can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients                                                                                                                       | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Stick+<br/>Coalor<br/>Charcoal+<br/>AnyLogorStemor<br/>AnyStripped LogorStemor<br/>AnyWoodorHyphaeor<br/>AnyStripped WoodorHyphae |                 |

Campfires also generate in villages and ancient cities, but picking them up requires a tool with Silk Touch. They can also be bought from fisherman villagers.

Next, you need either a bee nest or a beehive. Bee nests generate on trees only in few biomes. Within these, each tree has a fixed chance to spawn a bee nest. Every bee nest generates along with 3 bees.

| Biome                                                           | Chance |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Meadow                                                          | 100%   |
| Cherry Grove<br/>Plains<br/>Sunflower plains<br/>Mangrove Swamp | 5%     |
| Flower forest                                                   | 2%     |
| Forest<br/>Birch forest<br/>Old growth birch forest             | 0.2%   |

Alternatively, you can also craft a beehive like so:

| Ingredients              | Crafting recipe |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| AnyPlanks+<br/>Honeycomb |                 |

Then, get a glass bottle. It can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Glass       | 3               |

Other methods of obtaining glass bottles include drinking potions, fishing, and killing witches.

Place the campfire directly under the beehive or bee nest. The campfire's smoke will reach the beehive if it is within five blocks below it. Now you have to wait until bees fill up the hive with honey; this is indicated by a changed texture of the block and honey particles dripping from it. Bees can fill up their hive only if there is something nearby that they can pollinate:

- flowers(other than wither roses),
- flowering azaleas,
- flowering azalea and cherryleaves,
- mangrove propagules,
- spore blossoms,
- chorus flowers.

The plant can't be inside of a flower pot.
When the beehive/bee nest is filled up, use a bottle on it; you will get a honey bottle and the advancement.

## The Parrots and the Bats
Breed two animals together

Requirements: Breed two breedable mobs together.

Use one breedable mob with the item that they can breed with, and then use the same type of mob nearby with that item. They will come together and make a baby (or in some cases, lay an egg). As soon as the breeding is done, you will be granted the advancement.

There are 25 types of breedable mobs: for a complete list, see Two by Two below. Cows, sheep and chickens are probably the easiest animals to breed in early-game, as they are common and don't require very expensive items. Cows and sheep breed with wheat, while chickens breed with seeds. You can also, for example, breed tamed wolves with any type of meat and tamed cats with a raw cod or raw salmon.

Note that, despite the name of this advancement, you can't actually breed parrots or bats.

## 
Have an Allay deliver items to you

Requirements: An allay must deliver an item to you.

First, find an allay. They can only spawn in woodland mansion jail cells and pillager outpost cages; both of these structures are quite rare. Outposts are a bit more common, but mansions are recommended for finding allays for two reasons:

- not every outpost has allays, while almost every mansion spawns some;
- cartographervillager can sell a map pointing directly to a mansion, while there is no good method of finding outposts.

After you find an allay, get any two identical items. Give the allay one of them (use the allay with an item), and drop the other one on the ground. The allay will pick up the item on the ground and throw it to you, awarding you the advancement.

## 
Get in Boat and float with a Goat

Requirements: Enter a boat that is occupied with a goat

First, prepare a boat (not a boat with chest!). Next, locate a goat; they only spawn in three mountain biomes: frozen peaks, jagged peaks and snowy slopes.

When you have found a goat, place a boat on the block right next to the goat. Push the animal inside if needed; lead might also be useful. When the goat enters the boat, use the boat to enter yourself. You will then get the advancement.
