### Open the world to LAN
Sometimes you're desperate to cheat, so as to prevent what you all done come into nothing. More specifically, you may want to change the game rule after the world was created, but you may find you did not allow cheating when creating the world.

There is an "Open to LAN" option, which allows you to enable cheats, even if you did not toggle "Allow Cheating" when creating the world. When cheats are enabled, you can go into Creative mode and replace lost items, as well as set /gamerule keepInventory to true. However, note that this is cheating. Many players believe that it's better to think about their mistakes and start over.

Be careful if you open the world to LAN because if you click "esc", mobs, blocks, and other in-game things can still move, even when you're paused. That means if you're chasing a cow while in LAN and clicked "esc" to pause, the cow can still run or move.

However, if you are playing multiplayer and you are not the server owner, you cannot just enable cheats. In that case, you could ask the one that hosts the Multiplayer game to replace the items or create a new world in singleplayer.

## Crafting tips
Recent versions of Minecraft feature a recipe book, which supplies most of the recipes that can be made with all items you've ever picked up.   It can also make it easier to craft as well as remember recipes.  That said, it is possible to craft recipes that aren't in the book yet, by remembering their crafting pattern. (They are then added to the book, along with many recipes using the new item.)

For several common wooden tools, there are routines to quickly craft them with an even number of logs, dragging the planks or sticks into place and using shift-click to craft multiple recipes.

- For fences, you should have a multiple of 5 logs. Convert them to planks, then convert one-fifth (1/5) of the total to sticks.  With 20 logs, you can just turn the smaller stack of 16 planks into sticks, then craft that with the other stack of 64 planks, for 48 fences.
- By comparison, fence gates are easy, and cost exactly 1 log each.  Convert the logs to planks, then convert half of the planks to sticks.
- For ladders, crafting 7 logs at a time into sticks lets you just drag the resulting pile into the ladder shape, for 24 ladders.
	- If you have alotof spare sticks, a stack of them makes 27 ladders with one stick left over.
- For slabs, doors, or trapdoors, multiples of 3 comes out even.
- Chests cost 2 logs each.  Crafting 16 logs gets you a stack of 64 planks, which you can drag into the box shape to make 8 chests at a time.

When working with the many kinds of stone, a stonecutter is useful.  Not only does it let you make various decorative blocks individually (without needing to craft 3 or 4 blocks at a time), but it makes stone stairs cheaper:  The stonecutter can make 1 stair per block, while the crafting table needs 6 blocks to make only 4 stairs.

Later, you may get hold of netherrack, and one of the important things to make from it is nether brick fences.  The recipe is a little complex, but can likewise be made in bulk:    Smelt your netherrack into nether brick items, and take 180 bricks at a time (3 stacks minus 12). Drag these across the crafting table to split them into 9 stacks.  Set aside one of the stacks, and combine the other stacks pairwise into the 2×2 nether brick block recipe.  That gives you the blocks and set-aside bricks for 60 fences.  Even if you don't bother setting aside the 12 bricks, this still works; just craft a couple of extra nether brick blocks in the process.

If you are struggling to remember crafting patterns, try taking a closer look at a pattern, like the fishing rod pattern. Take notice of how the sticks and string line up to look like a fishing rod. Many patterns follow this trait, such as doors, which use two columns of wood planks to make the rectangular shape of a door, and swords, which use either two wooden planks, cobblestone, iron ingots, gold ingots, or diamonds for the blade and a stick for the handle. 

In single-player, you can also pause the game and visit the wiki for that item for the recipe. 

You can also save a bit of time by stacking some items to make two or more different items in a pass.  The examples below show how to stack items to craft two or three items in quick succession.

### Smelting
For smelting, it hardly matters what's being smelted, as long as the furnace type is appropriate.  

- Setting up an "auto-smelter" or a furnace withhoppersto feed in items and remove its output makes life easier.
- A single furnace smelting a stack of items requires 10 minutes 40 seconds, or more than half aMinecraftday.
- Using ablast furnaceorsmokerfor appropriate jobs takes half the time:  5 minutes 20 seconds for a stack.
- Splitting up jobs into multiple batches to use two or more furnaces (perhaps of different types) can save alotof time.
- While a few items worth of wasted fuel hardly matters in the long run, it's worth knowing a few numbers that come out even:
	- 8 pieces of coal or charcoal smelts a stack of items, a stack of coal smelts 8 stacks.
	- 16 dried kelp blocks smelts 5 stacks of items, a stack of the blocks smelts 20 stacks.
	- 16 blaze rods smelts 3 stacks, a stack of rods smelts 12 stacks.
	- 4 blocks of coal smelts 5 stacks.
	- A stack of 16 buckets, filled with lava (they no longer stack) smelts 25 stacks, which is just two stacks short of a full chest.  (And one of those empty slots receive the emptied buckets.)
	- Most wooden "leftovers" can match planks:  2 stacks smelt 3 stacks of items.  The others mostly match either sticks (4 stacks smelt 3 stacks), or wooden tools and weapons (1 smelts 1).
	- InBedrock Edition, slabs burn as long as planks, so you can double your burning time by converting planks to slabs.  This even beats turning the logs into charcoal.
- Forreallybig jobs:  Smelting a full chest of stackable items (1,728 items) in a single furnace requires most of 5 hours real time, or almost 2½ hours in a smoker or blast furnace.  The fuel required is one of:
	- 18 lava buckets (with over a stack's worth of time left over)
	- 22 coal blocks, or 216 pieces (3 stacks+24 pieces).  The blocks save 18 pieces of coal, and the leftover time can smelt another half-stack (4 pieces' worth).
	- 87 (1 stack+23) dried kelp blocks
	- 144 (2 stacks+16) blaze rods
