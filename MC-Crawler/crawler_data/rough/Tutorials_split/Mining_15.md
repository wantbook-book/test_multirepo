### Amphitheater Mining
Start with a basic U-shaped mine, and make an "amphitheater" down the levels until the player have a one-block space. Then, make a doorway ahead to make another amphitheater mine. This is very useful, and the player can even make it decorative by adding staircases as stairs or chairs.

### Wanderer mining
This is a simple mining technique, but isn't used much because of the risk of getting lost. Start by making a staircase down until the player reach the level where the desired ore is most commonly found, and begin mining. Occasionally change directions and make multiple branches. If there is a rise, plow through it. If there is a fall, bridge it with cobblestone. The point is to cover as much area without changing their Y-coordinate.

### Perfectionist Mining
This form of mining is relatively simple. Find or make a cave. When the player found ores, dig it out. Then, measure the longest side of the ore. Turn the small hole into a perfect cube and they will probably find more ores.

### Shovel Mining
Simply create a staircase to the desired depth and make a tunnel to find pockets of dirt or gravel. With a shovel, mine all dirt/gravel and search the created cave. It is very similar to caving, except they are making their own cave. This technique is very useful on older server where all caves had been explored. The advantage is that players don't need to spend too many resources on tools, because they mainly use shovels, a cheap and reasonably fast tool. On the other hand, yields are smaller than from caving or strip mining.

### Worst Case Scenarios
If the player falls into lava, do not panic; swim upward to get out, then try to get far away from the lava and to water if they can. This way even if they die, their items won't be destroyed by the lava. If they need to heal, eat golden apples or drink some Potions of Healing or Regeneration and hide in a corner/away from mobs, and make sure they use a water bucket if they have one. If the player know they are going to die anyway, press F3 and F2 (and also press fn together if the F2 or F3 button has other functions) to take a screenshot of their coordinates. If they are burning to death, trapped, close to the lava, stand in a corner and encase themselves in a dirt or other hand breakable shell. Once they die, their items will be contained safely in the shell.

If they are trapped in blocks and are suffocating, try to dig looking downwards. This could assist them in getting out of the trapped pit.

If they are fighting and are going to die, press F3 then F2.

Whatever happens, they should look back upon what they did, and analyze how they died, and what they could do to improve.

If their pickaxe breaks and they have stumbled into a cave and they have lost their way, the only option is to punch their way out and this could take a while. If there are any nearby mineshafts, check them out, they can use planks to make a crafting table and tools or there might be a spare iron pickaxe floating around.

If they can, get an ender chest and start to put in their stuff from the most expensive/important to the cheapest/least valuable. When they spawn back to their house, put another ender chest and take out their stuff.

### Best Case Scenario
Should the player happen to accumulate a large amount of resources, such as, perhaps, 2 stacks of iron ore and 10 diamonds, they may be tempted to delve further into the cavern. Resist this urge and return to their base to empty their loot. Dumping off their goodies instead of trying to explore longer may help in the long run, and will reduce the chance of losing their loot. Having a bed at the base of their mine is also helpful; if the player dies, they will spawn at the base of their mine, hopefully surrounded by their chests full of goodies.

If possible, carry an ender chest with the player to store their valuable resources, or put down a chest where they are at, put their loot in it, and write down the coordinates of the chest. They can come back to the chest later. Find the current coordinates by F3‌[Java Edition  only] or /gamerule showcoordinates true‌[Pocket Edition  only].

### Safety
When going for a mining trip, make sure that the player take proper precautions to not die because of sand or gravel. Use their best judgement and be careful when digging. When going mining, after they are finished and they make their way back, try to go out the way they came. That way, players know they are safe and there is no risk of lava, water, gravel, or sand falling on them and killing them. Digging a new shaft to escape the underground could result in sand falling on them when it turns out they dug their exit below a desert biome, or they could be drowned when the entire ocean floods their exit shaft. If players do get lost, they can dig up in a stairs pattern so that sand and gravel won't kill players and they won't be drowned if water comes through. If gravel does happen to fall on them, do not panic and immediately hold down the left mouse button to dig the gravel out. This will save themselves from suffocating.

Stairs pattern: A=Airspace B=Block

Never take valuable items when going mining. The player don't want to delve into dangerous caves while carrying tons of iron and diamonds, for if they lose them while mining, they will be sorry. Carry more supplies for longer trips, but don't carry more than they can afford to lose to lava. Normally, they will want to use stone pickaxe for economy, but carry at least one iron pick for advanced ores (gold, redstone, and of course diamond). If they have tons of iron and are impatient, they might use iron pickaxe in general, but while those are faster, they only last twice as long (block-wise) as stone tools, and they will be going through a lot of pickaxe regardless. Take a diamond pickaxe if they want to be fast and efficient for its durability, or to collect some obsidian. Make sure to bring a sword, or at the very least, a bow and some arrows.

Supplies to bring while mining: Crafting table, furnace, sticks, cobblestone, water bucket, picks, swords, food, armor and fishing rod.
