### Minute Three
3:00–4:00

Dig down or into hills using your fist on the dirt, and then use the pickaxe to gather at least 19 blocks of stone, which drops as cobblestone when mined. This cobblestone enables you to build your first tools and a furnace.

This hole can be your first basic shelter if you want, so pick a suitable place. Remember to never mine straight down. Once you have stone tools, you can explore caves, so be on the lookout for a cave opening. These are quite easy to find, occurring in every biome, and contain ores, which give resources and are very useful. However, do not venture far into one this early in the game. If you see a monster in one, retreat right away, sealing the passage between you and the monster with basic blocks (dirt, etc.) as you currently don't have any weapons or armor.

Once you have cobblestone, place your crafting table again (if you moved it) and use it to make a stone axe (Surprisingly, this item deals more damage ‌[JE  only]), a stone pickaxe, and a stone sword. You may have to convert more wood into sticks.




It never hurts to get more wood, so try to have at least 10 logs for the night. It's okay if you don't get enough. you can collect more in the morning.

Break the crafting table, collect it, and remember your spawn point. You can use the coordinates from the F3 menu and/or take a screenshot.‌[JE  only]

### Minute Four
4:00–5:00

Now that you have a sword (or axe on Java Edition), you could start killing excess animals with it (any animals in excess of 2 of each type), and then collecting their drops, although food isn't a problem until your third day. When collecting meat exactly six of the same type is best for efficient cooking. Go after sheep if they're available because they drop wool, which is needed for a bed, and also give mutton for food. If you see a horse then generally don't kill it. Leave it alone for now — it only drops leather which is useless before you have access to enchanting, and taming it is pointless until you find a saddle. Don't waste your time if you are behind. Don't bother attacking wolves, as they don't have any item drops, are rather dangerous if you attack when starting out, and can be tamed with bones obtained from skeletons, turning them into wolves that can protect you. If you are lucky enough to run into cats, then don't kill them either, or even scare them away, as they can scare away creepers and can also be tamed with raw fish. Also, always make sure to leave at least 2 of every animal, so that you can breed them for later.

Try to find coal and a place for your first shelter. Hillsides are best for both. If you do not see coal, collect some more logs (and craft an axe if you skipped that earlier). If you are planning to grow crops at this shelter site, ensure there is water nearby.

## Midday
### Minute Five
5:00–6:00

Look for a hill or mountain near your pillar, as it lets you easily make a shelter and give you resources along the way.

If you see sheep, kill 3 of them, all the same color, to gather 3 blocks of wool (to make a bed). If you want to have an easier time later on by breeding sheep, leave at least 2 sheep alive. (It is still advised to kill sheep whenever you find them until you have three blocks of the same color of wool to make a bed, since a bed is extremely important and extra sheep can usually be found by exploring further.)

### Minute Six
6:00–7:00

Dig into that hill, or if you're in flat terrain into the ground. Don't get fancy if there isn't any water (or land), animals, or trees in sight because you won't be using it for more than one night. (An especially desperate shelter is a 3×1 hole in the ground with one block covering the top.) If you find a village, you could stay in one of its houses. Be careful if you are on easy to hard difficulty, as you may have to deal with zombies, or husks if you are in a desert.
