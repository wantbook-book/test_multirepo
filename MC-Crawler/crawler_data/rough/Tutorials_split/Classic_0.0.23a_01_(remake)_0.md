### Mobs
** Human **
- Spawned by pressingG.
- Oddly, they can walk past the world border. They will fall through the bedrock if they go too far.
- They are client-side only and will not show up for other players in multiplayer.
- The model is not made correctly and makes the human look short.

### World generation
** Terrain **
- Generated terrain with hills and lakes, with small caves under the surface.

** Generated structures **
- Trees, made oflogsandleaves.

** World Size **
World Size is limited.

### Gameplay

### General

### Pause screen
- Drained Ocean before flooding itAbility to copy the URL link to give to other players for them to join.
- For browsers that do not support WebRTC, the URL link and "Copy" button have been replaced with the "Save level" and "Load level" buttons.
	- Clicking on any of these buttons will show the text "<html>" instead of the buttons that allowed the player to save or load a level.

## Bugs
- When exiting and entering the world, the top textures of all blocks that were ataltitudebecame invisible.
- Drained Ocean after flooding it, I noted with red the peak of 1675 Chunk updates, but later there was a even higher peak of 2.5 million chunk updates.The human mob model is glitched.
- Unloaded chunks turned white.
- The sea level in the game world did not match the sea level outside the world, sometimes there still occur "drained" oceans, see images.
- The high peak...FPS counter is inaccurate on some browsers and will sometimes display bogus/random numbers.
- Zooming in and out will sometimes cause a huge drop on FPS, this will cause an performance impact, and this will make all blocks disappear, and display an error icon.
- The game can fail to load the player's current world and instead generates a new one. In this case, any modified blocks (even air) from the previous map are carried over to the newly-generated map, overwriting any otherwise-generated blocks.
- The music sometimes overlaps with other music and keeps building up to the point it is unbearable.
