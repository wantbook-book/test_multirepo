This is a semi-automatic design suitable for all types of crops.

This design uses a villager wearing a straw hat to plant and harvest carrots, potatoes, or wheat

This design is slower than others, but it doesn't require the player to manually plant seeds.

## Semi-automatic farming

There are ways to harvest crops semi-automatically.

- Most common is water: Flowing water breaks crops, and produces their usual drops. This can be used to harvest crops semi-automatically, and carry the resulting items to some central location such as ahopper. A water flood does not revert farmland back into dirt.
- Sticky pistonscan be used to move the farmland block itself, breaking the crop without reverting the farmland to dirt. Water currents for collecting the items can be placed under the farmland rather than beside it, making this method more compact than harvesting directly with pistons. A pair of pistons, appropriately clocked, could be used to shift an entire row of farmland.
- Crops are also broken when directly pushed bypistons, with the usual drops. Unfortunately, this reverts the farmland back into dirt, so that it needs to be re-tilled after every harvest, rather defeating the point of automation.

Automatic harvesting is generally an all-or-nothing business: harvesting every plant regardless of whether it is mature. In this situation, it is best not to wait for every last plant to finish growing, as there are always a few that take much longer than normal. The optimal time to harvest wheat in particular turns out to be when 80% (4⁄5) of the plants have matured, and this is at least acceptable for carrots and potatoes. Assuming that the field is immediately replanted, harvesting at this time results in the greatest overall rate of production, along with a surplus of seeds for wheat. The section on growth rates gives the optimum harvesting time in minutes for some common planting arrangements.

Because bonemeal can force crops to grow more quickly—ignoring normal concerns like growth rate or ambient light—it can be used to create large amounts of wheat or other crops quickly. A number of farm designs focus on using bonemeal exclusively, sacrificing volume and growth efficiency for speed/ease of planting and harvesting. An example which takes advantage of the inventory mechanics to minimize the time required to plant and harvest can be seen here:

### Flooded-cell farm
Layer by layer map of one cell.
This farm is divided into cells of 29 plants, where each cell is flooded individually by a single piston and water block (or bucket-bearing dispenser). The drops are washed into a stream, gathering them to a single point.

There’s a stream of water in the center of the farm, which needs to go down 1 block every 8 blocks toward a collection point. This can be mirrored on the other side of the collection point, to cut the total depth needed.

On one or both sides of the stream are farming cells. The cells are separated from each other with two block high walls. If a 1-block high wall or fencing is used, some of the drops may fall onto the barrier and out of the flow. Under every wall separating the cells from each other is a source block of water, to hydrate the farmland on both sides of the wall.

The design as shown uses a piston to control the flow of water. The piston is normally extended. Above the extended piston shaft is a water source block, surrounded by 8 (or even 4) glass blocks or panes. Glass is needed so that light goes through the plants. When the switch is turned off, the piston retracts and the water flows through.

The piston setup can be replaced with a dispenser containing a bucket of water and using a button instead of a lever for the switch. Either way, the pistons or dispensers should be wired together behind the cells with repeaters as needed, to allow triggering them from some central point. 

When released, the water harvests the crops and washes them into the stream. At the end of the stream, you can collect your drops, or place a hopper to do it for you.

## Fully automatic farming using villagers
Fully-automatic farms can be constructed using a farmer villager that plants and harvests crops and a second non-farmer villager that the farmer will exchange harvests with, allowing the farm to capture the items. Such a farm can produce bread (Note: Bread doesn't work due to MC-204073), beetroots, carrots and potatoes. This was originally designed in "Carrot and Potato Crop Farm Tutorial | Minecraft 1.14/1.15 (Java Edition)"  – @LogicalGeekBoy on YouTube and a tiled layout is presented in "1.14.3 Efficient Automatic Carrot/Potato Farm"  – @ilmango on YouTube.

The farm must be entirely within the bounds of a village or must be more than 32 blocks away from the outer boundary of any village. Otherwise the villager attempts to make his way to the nearby village instead of tending the crops.[verify]
