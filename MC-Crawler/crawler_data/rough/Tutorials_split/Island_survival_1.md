### Food from animals
If there is a chicken on the island and you are not desperate for food, collect its eggs as they are laid. Each egg thrown has a 1‚ÅÑ8 chance of producing another chicken. This is one way to have a supply of chickens for food. Raw chicken does need cooking, however, as it can inflict food poisoning.

A sustainable food supply from animals requires breeding, and that requires farming, as described above. Once a producing farm is set up, however, eating the crop-based food is often a more efficient use of it. Animals are useful for other reasons, such as a source of milk to remove Poison and other bad effects, or leather for some armor.

If there are islands nearby, use some wood to build a boat to travel to other islands to find animals. An animal can be led into a boat by holding appropriate food (any type of seeds for chickens, wheat for cows and sheep, and potatoes, carrots or beetroots for pigs).

A lead is useful for pulling an animal into a boat. Leads are easily obtained by killing the wandering traders that regularly spawn on or near the island. Because you have no emeralds, and there is no penalty for killing the trader, leads and llamas are the only things of value that a wandering trader can provide. They drop two leads when killed. These leads can be used to move animals.

### Constructing a shelter
After collecting wood to create planks, build a crafting table in a convenient place. A door and wooden pickaxe are the essential things required for now.

If the island has a steep slope, or wall of dirt anywhere, it is simplest just to dig a cave into it, and place a door at the entrance. If possible, have the entrance face east so that the sunrise is visible through the door.

For a shelter above ground, build a minimal one from dirt or sand, possibly only two blocks high inside, and place the door in the entrance. You'll eventually be mining anyway, so if you have enough materials, make room for a crafting table, a chest, and a mineshaft or stairway leading down.

Be sure you have nothing overhanging the entrance (no tree leaves, no other blocks), otherwise zombies can gather by your door during the night and be protected from sunlight when daytime comes, trapping you in your shelter. Without any overhang for protection, zombies burn up after sunrise.

Enter your shelter at sunset. Once you are in your shelter, start making some basic tools on your crafting table:

- Build afurnace, several stone pickaxes, and a couple of stoneswordsas soon as possible. Your wooden pickaxe lets you minecobblestone, which should be easy to find by digging down a few layers into your island. Cobblestone lets you build stone tools.
- Craft moretorches. If you have not found any coal while digging for cobblestone, use planks (inJava Edition) or wood slabs (in Bedrock Edition), as fuel for your furnace to smelt logs to create charcoal, which you combine with sticks to maketorches. You may have to wait for daytime to harvest and plant more trees to get more wood for tools and fuel.

If you want to expand the shelter, simply dig down a few blocks and dig out rooms underground. Add ladders to the vertical shaft to get back up and add torches as necessary and as resources permit. Even if it is not needed, it is generally recommended for one to dig underground anyway so as to find cobblestone to make a furnace and to obtain another building material so as to avoid wasting wood. Make a stone pickaxe, sword, axe, shovel, and optionally a hoe, if you are in a position to start farming.

Once you are in a position to build an actual home base, note that islands often have limited space available. Therefore, you don't have much room to maneuver with if you build your house on the island itself, especially if it is a small island. A better approach is to build your base underground. Alternatively, you can build a platform on the water by placing a block on top of kelp to start the platform, then build your house from that starting point it and connect it to the island with a bridge.

### Sleeping
Islands often have no sheep, so if it is impractical to find a sheep on another nearby island and shear it for wool, you can still get wool by crafting it from four pieces of string obtained from killing spiders. Once you have three wool, you can make a bed with three wooden planks.

It is advisable, however, to prioritize string to make a fishing rod for a reliable food supply before hunting down spiders to craft wool for a bed. It is often more efficient to find a sheep on another island. Occasionally a sheep may spawn on your island while you are away from it, or while you're mining deep underground.

## Mining
To make a compact mine, craft ladders with sticks, and start digging down. Optionally, you can make a staircase, so that you don't need ladders to get back up. To look for a cave, listen for the sounds of bats, and go toward the sound (it might be helpful if you turn subtitles on so it points out where the sound is coming from).

Once you find a cave, start mining. However, make sure that you have decent tools and weapons, plenty of torches, and optionally a shield and armor before attempting to go through caves, as monsters spawn in them. This is more likely if the island has been lit up and you have kept the chunks loaded, so that more mobs spawn in underground spaces and do not despawn.

Mining on an island is similar to how it is in normal survival. However, it is recommended to mine deep down, so that you don't accidentally burst into the ocean. It is most necessary to find, in this order, coal ore, iron, flint (from gravel), diamond, and obsidian (which requires a diamond pickaxe). Once you have obsidian, flint, and iron, you can make a Nether portal.
