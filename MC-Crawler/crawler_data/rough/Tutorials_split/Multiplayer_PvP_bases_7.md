## VI- The End Base
Since in most multiplayer servers, the End dimension is usually broken and destroyed by previous players, this base style will likely not be the player’s first base, but built while the player already has a base. Not many people can be bothered searching the entire empty void, so this is a very good stealth-oriented base. It’s hard to build, but the means justifies the end. 

##### Pros
- Very hard to find if put a good distance from the spawn point (around 250-500 blocks).
- Water shields are possible (better than Nether base).
- Similar to Sky Base (endless void down there).
- If you are strong enough you can control the return portal and force others to give you their stuff to get out of the end.
- Easy access to ender pearls.
- Almost everything renewable in the overworld is renewable in the end.

##### Cons
- Material for building transport is difficult (you have to teleport a lot of times).
- You might fall in the void without anElytra.
- Endermenmight pick blocks off your base walls.

Materials: Choice of wall material (stone, obsidian), iron-diamond pickaxes, ender pearls, 5-6 dirt stacks, some armor and weapons against endermen.

### Building:
#### Main Island
Pros:

- Similar to Part I: The Above-Ground Castle.
- The end is populated with a lot of endermen, which can annoy the raiders and keep them away.
- Easy to bring in animals and villagers.
- Very fast experience farm if ender dragon is respawned and killed.

Cons:

- The ender dragon can destroy it.
- Easy to find.

Build your walls out of obsidian and include a liquid layer. Build your defenses. Add farms, grinders, trading halls, anything you need.

#### Outer Islands
Pros:

- Harder to find than main island base.
- Easy access to chorus fruit, end rods, and purpur.
- Ender Dragon cannot destroy it.
- Easy access to elytra, ender pearls, shulker boxes.

Cons:

- Harder to transport animals/villagers.

Of course, you teleport first to the end (watch out for other enemy players!). Then, make sure no one is watching, then make a bridge or travel via End Gateway to whatever direction possible, out of the main island. Make sure you destroy the bridge. The main island should not be at least visible. You can start on the base immediately as soon as you are content with the surroundings like how many abandoned or non-abandoned bases are around. Make sure to claim the area first. Then, a few hours later, your base will be done!

#### Void Base
Pros:

- Extremely hard to find.
- Very well hidden.
- Raiders will need to do a lot of digging to find your base.

Cons:

- Extremely hard to transport animals/villagers.
- Extremely hard to expand.
- Very likely to die while building.

Dig a hole down to where you want your base to be. Have people guard the top of the hole. When you reach the void, use lava and water to build a cobblestone pillar to the void. Place ladders on the cobblestone. At the bottom, make an overhang and use that to start your base. Fill in the deep hole so raiders cannot get in. Use a flying machine/elytra for leaving the base or going to the surface.

#### Secret Base
Pros:

- Extremely hard to find.
- Animals and Villagers can be transported through slime block flying machines.
- Raiders need elytra to find your base. Their elytras will run out of durability, dropping them into the void.

Cons:

- Flying machines have to move thousands/millions of blocks to get to the place you want the base.

Build a flying machine and drive it to where you want your base. Place blocks on the machine so the pistons can't move. Use those blocks for your base. When you finish your base, fly back and bring in your animals/villagers. Make sure the flying machine is at the right y-level, or else the machine will go over the base, or suffocate the animals/villagers.

#### Getting ready for the rest of forever
- Set up a food source
- Set up a mob grinder
- Continue thickening of walls for defense.
- Set up an armory for emergencies
- Loot the nearby abandoned bases for loot.

## Defending your base against hackers
You will probably want to try to protect against hackers, some of the most unfair players in a game. There are several options. Most of the options below are ways someone can protect against most hackers.

** Fly Hack **
Some fly hacks can allow a hacker to easily fly around and reach any sky/end base. The best way to combat this is to place lava around the base, preferably two layers, as well as lava all the way to the block limit (at least 5 blocks higher than the top of your base), so that they cannot enter easily.

** Xray Hack **
What you need: Depends, but at the most, some pickaxes, any large quantity ore, and dispensers/hoppers/droppers/anything that can contain items, but not be detected by ChestESP.

For Xray hackers, they can see into the ground, ignoring any stone entities, and can see any bases underground. This is mainly for underground bases.

What you can do: 1. Make it extremely small: bases are harder to detect by x-ray-ers, if they are small. So, try to make your base as small as possible. 2. Surround it with ores: Average hackers keep x-ray on the same setting as normal, which means that they cannot see through ores. Surround your extremely small base with ores, preferably coal, with a silk touch pick. Try to make it look like a natural cluster of ores, not big or even shaped. Coal is recommended, as it is in large blobs. Also, try mixing the coal ores with other ores, preferably iron ore.

** For ChestESP **
The way ChestESP works is by detecting anychestsaround the hacker's viewpoint, a hack that can foil the x-ray defense. But, it can't detectdispensers,droppers,hoppersor anything that can storeitems. So, to protect against this, move everything you have in your chests into a storage compartment, anything above, or in your inventory.Ender chestsare extremely helpful, as well. Obviously, this is not the best way to store things, so if you feel confident in your base's security, you may just want to risk leaving your stuff in your chests.Shulker boxesstored withindispensersor an ender chest is usually the best method.
** For No-Clippers **
No-clip is a hack that aplayercan pass through walls like a spectator. The way to avoid it is to 1. Put lava around your base. 2. Put it as low as you can, meaning, at bedrock so some hackers will suffocate due to the distance they have to travel.
** For extremely experienced hackers **
The tricks above will not fool the most experienced hackers, who had personal experience with these kinds of things. For example, an experienced fly hacker might also turn on their LiquidInteraction to allow them to place blocks on any lava above and around your base, an experienced X-ray hacker may turn off rendering for ores while they find bases, or turn on rendering for dispensers, droppers, hoppers and minecarts with chests/hoppers. and an experienced teleport-hacker might be able to use X-ray to identify any defenses around it first, and remove them. However, a way someone can ultimately protect against any players is to make a completely un-raidable base, like above. While tricky, tough to gain resources, and sometimes fails, if you know how to make a nearly un-raidable base, you can survive nearly everything, but no base is unable to be raided.
