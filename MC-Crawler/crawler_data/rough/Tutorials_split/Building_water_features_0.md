## Designs
Here are examples of designs for several water and lava features, including fountains, waterfalls, water walls, a lava incinerator, and a swimming pool.

### Fountain
Fountains look great in large gardens, the center of a yard, the middle of a park, city, or amusement park.

#### Design 1
This design is a simple yet effective fountain. It has a square look to fit the theme of Minecraft, and it does not require any materials that are hard to acquire. You need a type of building block to start off with, as well as a bucket and a nearby water source.

To build this fountain, start off by constructing a 5X5 frame of any material you wish, but only place blocks on the edges, so that the water has a place to flow into. Then, build a 3 block high column in the middle of the frame. Just pour a water bucket on the top of the central column to finish it off, and the water should flow down all sides. You are done!

#### Design 2
Design 2
To build a fountain just like Design 1 but for a little more complex, polished, and round look, try placing a row of three blocks 2 blocks from the center of the fountain, on every side, and then connect them with one diagonal block. See the following picture for a demonstration. This picture uses stone bricks as the building block.

#### Fountain expansions
There are many things to make a fountain even better and bigger.

You can make the central column higher. No matter how high it is, the water will always flow into the trench at the bottom and will not spill out, if you have done it correctly. If you want a very tall fountain, consider making a 10 block tall column, or more. You can also expand the width as well as the height. Instead of making the frame 5×5, make it as big as you'd like. However, make sure that it is not any smaller than 5×5, or the water will flow onto the frame, and spill out. 

Another option to make your fountain bigger is to make the column in the middle bigger than one block. Consider using the center 3×3 area for the column. However, the frame must always be at least 4 blocks bigger in both length and width than the column. For example, if you had a 3×3 column, you must have at least a 7×7 frame. If you want a really giant fountain, make it with a 25×25 frame and a 3×3 column 25 blocks high. 

For a more complex and round feel, make the shape of your fountain frame in a circle. This is rather difficult in the blocky world of Minecraft, but it is still possible (see "Tutorials/Creating shapes"). This will make your fountain look even better. The fountain design 2 is an example of a fountain with a very small circle frame.

Consider decorating your fountain. Make the fountain floor where the water flows stone brick, instead of dirt. Surround the bottom layer of the fountain with leaves, to give it a great-looking blend with nature. You can also grow trees around the fountain, but don't make them so tall or so close that they cover up the fountain.

### Waterfall
This is an example of a 3 wide waterfall with a 4 block high wall, resulting in a 5 block high waterfall.
Build a 1 deep, at least 3 wide all, however high you would like, to start. Then, build a barrier 1 block above the top of the wall, to prevent the water from flowing out the wrong way. Finally, add water on the top of the wall. Also, if you would like, you can build a 1 block deep trench at the bottom of the waterfall, so that the water goes straight down instead of all over the place.
