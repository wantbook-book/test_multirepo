#### Alternative layout
An alternative layout with a smaller footprint takes advantage of the fact that a player must be within 16 blocks of a monster spawner for it to activate, but that monster spawners only check 9 blocks vertically for spawned mobs. Build the trap as above, except instead of being off to the side, the killing floor is 4-16 squares directly above the monster monster spawner. This requires less material, less x,z space and less precision in construction, though is 3-15 blocks taller.

To construct the trap this way, build a 9×5×9 room around the monster monster spawner with flowing water leading the mobs into a corner. Build a water ladder in this corner going 26-38 blocks upwards as measured from the top of the monster monster spawner. At the top of the ladder, direct the mobs a couple blocks in any direction with water, and into a 22 block drop chute. At the bottom of the drop chute, create a platform 1 block lower, with a 1×1 "window" into the chute through which you can strike the mobs safely from the platform.

### 
Firstly it should be noted that this was made with a zombie monster spawner in mind. Basically you just make a balcony of sorts and wail on the zombies as they approach you while being unable to hit you.

Seal the zombie monster spawner in a 5×5×5 chamber, naturally, you want it to stay in the center of the chamber at the lowest height. Outside of the chamber make a platform that is 2 blocks high that surrounds the outer wall, and while standing on this platform, punch a wide hole in the corner of the chamber 1 block above the platform. Remove the corner block so you can stand in the corner while the zombies practically funnel toward you. They'll be able to push you, but not hit you at all, so you're free to smack them on the head with your weapon of choice.

Naturally the rotten meat they drop will remain inside the chamber, but the experience points will hover toward you. If for some reason, the points end up too far just walk around the chamber to their nearest corner.

Optional: lead some tamed wolves into the chamber before sealing it!

### Experience trap
1. Place torches to turn off the monster spawner.
2. Place water in two corners.
3. Dig a tunnel where the water converges.
4. Dig the tunnel path until the water ends.
5. Arrange a barrier so that mobs don't make it past the end of the water.

Recollect the torch and stand where the end of the tunnel is.

If done correctly you can slay the mobs and get experience and rare drops from mobs.

### 
This type of monster spawner is made for Humanoid type monster monster spawners (skeletons, zombies, and in some cases zombie pigmen), but can be modified for a spider monster spawner. First disable the monster monster spawner and areas around it with Torches so Mobs do not spawn and disrupt the creation of the trap. Now make a room 17 blocks wide by 9 blocks long and anywhere from 4-7 blocks high, with the monster spawner being in the rough center and 1-2 blocks above the ground. Now dig out the bottom row 1 down everywhere except the center, which should be dug down around 7 blocks. Place a water source block on each end of this dug out area and it should stop just before the center. Now place water source blocks at the top so that it should stop before running into the dug out area. Remove the torches so that the mobs start spawning, and go down so that you are at eye level with where the center area was dug down 7 blocks. Make it so you can only see the mobs feet on one side, and on the other use a slab to make it so you can just see the top of its head. This allows good use of both swords And bows (Also, some servers give bonus damage for Headshots).

### S-bend design
This type of trap allows a one-hit kill on zombies and skeletons; however, the drops and the experience are farther away.

Expand the floor so that there are two blocks of air below the monster spawner, and the walls so that the room is 9×9. Dig four blocks down on the block directly below the monster spawner and place water source blocks in each corner.

Dig one block north and two blocks south (three blocks tall for each direction), then go towards the south end, and make an access shaft. At the north end, dig a shaft, 30 blocks deep, and three pointing west. At the bottom, make a small room and light it up. Place ladders on the west end, and make an access shaft to the top of the ladders. Place blocks to the east of the ladders, except for the bottom few.

Place two bottom slabs on the block south to that directly below the monster spawner, and place trapdoors liberally (zombies and skeletons can climb ladders). Optionally, place hoppers at the bottom of the collection room.

## Multiple monster spawners of the same species
To maintain maximum efficiency a trap must take on an increased complexity in keeping mobs separated or moving quickly when dealing with multiple monster spawners of the same species. Minecraft first checks within the 17 wide by 17 long by 9 high area with the monster spawner in the center (or 8×8×4 radius from the monster spawner) for mobs of the same species as the monster spawner. If there are fewer than 6 mobs of the same species in the checking zone, it will spawn a mob within half the distance of the checking radius. This means that with two monster spawners of the same species near to each other, there will be a zone that mobs will count for both monster spawners and severely impact the spawn rates. It would be a wise idea to work out where these checking zones overlap and ensure that mobs being funneled to the trap do not enter that zone and/or leave the overlapped/checking area as quickly as possible to maintain peak monster monster spawner output.
