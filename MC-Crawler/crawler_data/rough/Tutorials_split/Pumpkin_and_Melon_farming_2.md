## Fully automatic farms
These farms require no player interaction for the harvesting and collection of pumpkins or melons after being built. Fully automatic farms require pistons and redstone to function and are generally more expensive to build than manual or semi-automatic pumpkin and melon farms.

Farms are triggered automatically in one of three ways:

1. By a system based on time. You can use either a Redstone/hopper clock or a daylight sensor for this.
2. By makingbud switches, or placingobservers, that detect when an adjacent block updates.
3. Using a simple Redstone circuit that completes when a pumpkin or melon grows.

Pumpkins and melons are collected in a combination of the following:

1. Water streams
2. Hoppers
3. Minecarts with hoppers




### 
This farm requires an observer directly above a plant and pistons that activate when the plant moves. These outputs are then taken through a minecart with hopper into a chest. This is cheap but harder to build due to the orientations of the pistons and and observers. This is a short video explaining the topic.




### Opaque block detection farms
These farms send redstone power through the space where a pumpkin or melon can grow. When the block there is opaque, redstone power can pass to next component, triggering a piston to harvest the pumpkin or melon.

These designs made obsolete by the observer. Observer based melon and pumpkin farms are generally easier to make, more compact, and, in some cases, more efficient.

#### Single plant detection
This design requires only 1 piston per pumpkin stem and doesn't require a bud switch. This pumpkin farm fits within a 5Ã—5 area and is relatively simple to build.

Clock designs are superior to this as they allow for better control over the harvesting. It is possible for the two rightmost plants to grow long before the first one does, so more frequent harvesting is desirable.

#### Dropper hopper trigger
This melon/pumpkin farm is modular and uses a dropper/hopper combo to detect melon growth. The dropper should contain an item to be dispensed into the hopper, triggering the piston.

#### Dual-piston growth detection











































Simplified harvesting unit, side view
This design powers a sticky piston whenever a pumpkin or melon has grown. The sticky piston is used to power a regular piston and break the produce.

This design is tileable and stackable, which could be useful if you want a larger farm. When tileing, the rightmost column can be rotated around the air column behind the lower piston to save space.

When stacking, you may want to run a hopper line beside the redstone repeaters to the bottom so everything can be collected at a central location. It may also be possible to remove hoppers from the upper layers and allow the produce to fall down to the bottom.

The schematic shows half of tileable part of 4-growing-space floor plan. The other half is a north-to-south mirrored copy of the first half, sharing the central slice of hoppers and chests to keep iron cost low (7 hoppers per 4 growing spaces). 
Each growing space has 2 stems beside it. There are 2 rows of farmland between growing spaces, so each stem in the middle has 5 wet farmlands nearby, resulting in better growth rate than if the stem has less than 4 wet farmlands around. The leftmost and rightmost side of the farm should also have 2 rows of 3 farmlands to have the same stem growth rate. Not all of melon slices are collected by the hoppers, but the amount collected is probably good enough.

The second floor is a left-to-right mirror image of first floor, so the upper hopper of the first floor pulls items from the large chest of second floor.

As shown by the schematics below, the design can be varied for early game before slimeballs have been obtained for sticky pistons. It instead uses 2 regular pistons and 2 sands per growing space. However, the height is 6 blocks, 2 times taller than the original design.

### BUD circuit farm
#### 
This farm is small, has no sticky pistons, and is resource friendly. It uses a BUD switch to determine if a pumpkin/melon has matured and then activates a piston to break it and send it into a hopper.

### Vertical observer farms
An observer on top of a melon/pumpkin growing block, looking down, can be used to detect a melon/pumpkin growing. 

The observer also detects the piston arm and the other block moved by the piston to harvest a pumpkin or melon and may cause the piston to extend and retract in a loop if there is no mechanism to prevent it.

An observer on top of the stem inhibits growth, so it cannot be used in this position. 

#### Design 7
This design is lag-friendly and uses the observer block to detect grown pumpkins (or melons). It's compact and cheap to build and can be easily expanded.

side view slice
This design uses a sticky piston to push the observer down to harvest a pumpkin or melon. The piston does not receive power from the direction it faces, so another route is needed to transmit the signal. A slime block is placed between the observer and piston to help extract the observer's signal. The signal is passed through a 2-tick redstone repeater that extends it enough for the sticky piston to pull the slime block and observer back to their original position.
