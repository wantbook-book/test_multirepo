# Tutorials/Speedrun
A speedrun is a play-through of a video game performed with the intention of completing it as fast as possible. Speedruns may cover a whole game or a selected part, such as completing all achievements/advancements, or killing a certain boss. Players attempt speedruns mainly to challenge themselves and to entertain and compete with others. For experienced Minecraft players, speedruns add a new challenge and sometimes ignore or subvert established game principles, such as never digging straight down.

While most games have an end or definite goal, Minecraft is an open-ended game and has no specific goal or end. However, entering the exit portal is a common goal for Minecraft speedruns. Other goals may include killing both major bosses or earning some or all of the advancements/achievements.

## Types
In addition to the goal of the speedrun, the rules can vary as well. Some of the most common types of speedruns are as follows:

- Set Seed (level generation) seed: The player enters a known seed before starting the world, presumably exploring the world beforehand to find location of loot, nether fortress, stronghold, etc. Players might run one seed repeatedly trying to reduce the time.

- Random seed: The player begins a new world using a random seed. However, it is not against the rules to start a new world, look around for a village or other useful features and restart with another new, random world if necessary. Speedrunning would be trying to beat Minecraft as fast as possible.

- Filtered Seed: The player is given a 1.16 seed that is guaranteed to have characteristics that make it more likely to lead to a good run. These include a repairable ruined portal close to spawn with a looting sword, a close bastion and fortress in the nether, and a close stronghold in the ocean if the portal back to the overworld is made near the fortress.

- Glitched/Glitchless: The player chooses whether to take advantage of glitches in the game (which is common in speedruns for other games) or not. InMinecraft, the most useful glitches duplicate items or blocks and many of these have been eliminated in recent versions, so speedruns using glitches are less common in newer versions.

- Icarus: Named after an ancient Greek myth, in this category the player is given anelytraand a stack of firework rockets to start with. This can help create faster-paced speedruns, even on seeds where the relevant structures are far away or separated by difficult terrain.

- Difficulty: The player chooses the world's difficulty setting. Peaceful worlds do not spawn enderman and usually require players to buy ender pearls from cleric villagers and runs in peaceful difficulty are considered a separate category from Any%.

- Version: Minecraft speedruns are divided into four further categories according to the version used for the speedrun:
	- Pre 1.9, usually played on 1.7.2 or 1.8.9.
	- 1.9 - 1.12, usually played on 1.11.2 or 1.12.2.
	- 1.13 - 1.15, usually played on 1.15.2.
	- 1.16+, usually played on 1.16.1.

There are also other types of speedruns. There are co-op speedruns, which is where multiple players work together to kill the ender dragon, All advancements/achievements speedruns, where the goal is to complete every single achievement or advancement, and category extensions (catexts), which are where the player tries to complete a different goal, usually obtaining an item or getting an advancement. Some category extensions are All Bosses, Obtain All Swords, Arbalistic, and How Did We Get Here?


The goal of the majority of this article is to provide guidance for glitchless speedruns on random seeds with the goal of killing the ender dragon. This is also referred to as Any% RSG.

## General tips
Just as golf can be described as a nice walk spoiled by a little white ball, a glitchless speedrun can be a fun challenge spoiled by a little green pearl. Obtaining ender pearls is almost always going to be the most time-consuming part of any speedrun. Therefore, the priority should always be to kill endermen, and it's never too early to get your first ender pearl. After getting a weapon, listen for endermen in any caves you explore. Especially after entering the nether, look around for endermen as you search for the fortress. Ender pearls are considerably easier to obtain in the new 1.16 Nether Update, since Piglin trading has a chance of dropping many at a time. As such, it is also important to craft gold armor and mine any gold you find in the nether. It can be easier to hunt endermen in the nether because there are fewer other mobs to fight, there are frequently a lot of easy places to fight without being hit (such as standing in a 2 block high space), and they can be abundantly found within warped forests. Leaving the nether with your
blaze rods and ender pearls help you start traveling in the direction of a stronghold right away.

Finding a village early in your speedrun provides a fast source of food from the hay bales scattered around, after version 1.14, or the crops, in earlier versions. If you don't see a village right away, increase your render distance and head for higher ground to look around. Villages can also provide easy access to wood and cobblestone, a crafting table, beds for killing the ender dragon quickly, and loot if it has a blacksmith building. For your first few attempts at a speedrun, you may want to keep trying random worlds until you find a well-stocked village, or look up seeds with a village near the spawn area.

If you have plenty of iron ingots, you can craft shears and use them to cut leaves, which can be a fast way to get blocks for pillaring up or otherwise moving around.

Generally, you'll need a flint and steel to enter the nether. However, once you have a flint and steel you can also set mobs on fire before you kill them. This is a fast way to get cooked meat without waiting for a furnace.

While it's commonly called the number one unwritten rule of Minecraft, many players consider it normal to dig straight down during a speedrun, especially early in the run. This can save a lot of time, and you don't die if you are playing set seed and dig somewhere you know is hazard-free. This same idea holds true for other risky decisions. Most speedrunners consider taking risks such as entering the nether with no armor acceptable if it saves a large amount of time. If you die during the speedrun, you can just create a new world and start again. 

Think about the items you need and gather these along the way as many resources can suddenly become rare when you need them. For instance, you need gravel for flint, lava and water to make a nether portal, wool and wood for beds, and snowballs or arrows if you plan to use them to destroy the end crystals. Grab these items or make a note of their location as they can be hard to find when you need them.

If you need to travel in the overworld before making your nether portal, travel east or west to increase your X coordinate. Starting further east or west in the nether can make it faster to find a nether fortress.

Especially when looking for important things, such as water and lava to make a nether portal, blazes or other nether fortress mobs or silverfish to find the end portal, turn your volume up and turn on subtitles.‌[Java Edition  only] This helps you know when you are close and give you a hint on their direction.

Press F3 on your keyboard to turn on the debug screen and always know exactly where you are. When playing set seed, this also makes it easier to find any specific block or generated structure you found before. More advanced speedrunning tips also rely on the debug screen. 

2 or 3 golden apples can be of great help when fighting the dragon. When chopping down oak/dark oak trees, look for apples and keep an eye out for some gold ores when mining or looting. It's also possible to find golden apples or enchanted golden apples as loot. However, advanced speedrunners are able to kill the ender dragon with nearly no supplies. So, this might be considered a waste of time to some. 

TNT can be a quick way to destroy the cage around the end crystal and the end crystal itself at the same time. Place water on the ground, pillar up to the cage, place the TNT on it, activate it and drop down into the water. TNT can also be used to gather blocks quickly, including things like wood, hay bales, and gold blocks.
