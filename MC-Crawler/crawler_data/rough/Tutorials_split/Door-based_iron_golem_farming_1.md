## Iron golem farm designs
### Easy 2-tier build
Requires spawn chunks: no
Iron per hour: 40
Scalable: yes
Designed by: trunkz

** Description **
This is an older design by trunkz and one of the earliest to feature two spawning floors for greater efficiency. It uses several villager baskets and door pads and is a little outdated, but quite a good and efficient design for the time it takes to build.

This farm has been tested in Spigot 1.8. Extra care must be taken with breeding villagers as they no longer breed as easily as they did in earlier version. For testing in 1.8 the villagers were bred to a population of 20 on the ground before being transported to their cells (the individual villagers were transported to their cell by minecart, the other 18 went to their cell on a dirt ramp). The method given in the video will probably work if the breeding villagers are provided an ample supply of suitable food, e.g. carrots, potatoes or bread.





### Survival mode build: Iron golem village
Requires spawn chunks: no
Iron per hour: 30-40, plus occasional loot from other mobs
Scalable: No
Design by: Amatulic

A simple iron golem farm built in a village with free-roaming villagers.
Another simple iron golem village farm, using fences instead of glass to block the doors.
** Description **
This is a simple but flexible design that can be built fairly easily in survival mode, without the need to transport villagers. The villagers can multiply and roam freely, allowing you to trade with them. The farm will occasionally capture other mobs and their loot. Multiple tiers can be built to target more golems or different mobs.

** Preparation **
You will need to gather sufficient resources: enough wood to craft a bunch of doors and fencing, optionally enough sand to smelt 40 glass blocks, and some iron to craft a bucket. You may need wool to craft a bed to sleep on before you start, to move your spawn point to the village in case you die and respawn while you work — some of the work is best done at night while the villagers are indoors and not getting in your way.

Find a village near a source of lava. Some villages have a blacksmith shop with a pool of lava, others have a lava source nearby.

If buildings in the village are missing any doors, give them doors, but keep the total under 21 for now. This encourages villagers to multiply and gives them a place to go at night while you work. Clear a flat 16×16 area in the village; some villages have an empty quadrant that is useful for clearing. You can use existing building walls as boundaries for the 16×16 area. Fence off the area, preferably at night after the villagers have scurried indoors, and install a gate to enter and exit the area. Villagers are curious; don't open the gate if villagers are near it, or they will go through.

** Construction **
The design is a 16×16 pit 2 blocks below the base of the doors, with a 2×2 hole in the middle, buildings on each side of the pit, and fencing all around. It doesn't matter how you design the buildings as long as the door arrangement is symmetric from the center of the hole. Each building shown here has at least 5 doors facing the pit. Doors on the edge of the pit should be barred from opening using glass blocks if the doors are against the edge of the pit. If the pit is completely fenced, the doors will be set back a block and need not be barred by glass. Also there are doors on other walls; placement doesn't matter as long as it's all symmetrical; an imaginary line from any door through the central hole should intersect another door an equal distance on the other side of the hole.

If your doors are on the pit's edge, then avoid placing the doors during the day! Otherwise villagers might fall into your pit. Place them and block them with glass before daylight. Once you have placed all your doors, destroy any remaining doors in other buildings that aren't part of the symmetry of the farm. Also destroy beds in any building that isn't part of your farm, and put them in your new buildings, preferably in a symmetric arrangement. Your buildings around the pit should have doors (symmetrically placed) on the side walls to allow villagers to use the buildings.

This iron golem farm uses a lava blade trap, intended for when the farm gets additional tiers to catch mobs of different heights, although the single-tier farm described already killed a skeleton and a spider in its first hour of use. Unfortunately, baby zombies would still pass through.
Before placing your doors, you should first complete the trap. To sweep the iron golems from the pit into the hole, it's best to cover the whole area with running water, otherwise the iron golems will try to stick to the dry spots. The design shown here has a 1 block undercut around the pit's edge, with water sources along two parallel sides, 2 water source blocks at the middle of the other two sides for the final sweep. This design uses lava blades across the top and middle of a 2-wide by 3-high tunnel leading from the hole. At the bottom of the hole is a river that sweeps the mobs into the blades, and sweeps the loot toward the end of the tunnel.

At the end of the tunnel, build some access to the surface (shown in the first image on the lower right). Villagers are free to go in and out, but make a barrier in the tunnel to keep them from reaching the lava.

You don't need a hopper or chest at first — just watch your farm and when an iron golem falls through the hole, go into your tunnel and collect the iron that drifts toward you. After you have five iron ingots, you can craft a hopper and put it at the end of the water stream in the tunnel, to deposit the ingots into a chest.
