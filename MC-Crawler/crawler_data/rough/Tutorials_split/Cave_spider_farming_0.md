## Overview
Cave spiders can be dangerous enemies: they are shorter than a slab, one block wide, and apply the poison effect to the player. This makes them hard to farm. However, with some skills and care, it is possible. Cave spiders drop the same things that spiders do (string and spider eyes). Despite this, cave spider farms are useful because their spawners are easier to find. While a spider spawner may be tucked away in some dungeon, cave spider spawners can be found in many mineshafts.

## Construction
### Preparation
Before starting the farm, you will need to find a mineshaft that contains a cave spider spawner. The spawner area can be recognized by a large quantity of cobwebs. The cave spider spawner will be in the center of the cobwebs.

Once a spawner is found, there are a few things that need to be done before starting the farm. First, get rid of all the cobwebs with a sword or shears (sword yields string and shears yield the cobweb item itself), and quickly surround the monster spawner with torches, so that cave spiders won't be able to spawn. Be careful not to accidentally mine the cave spider spawner, because you will not be able to get it back.

The next thing to do is to make the layout for the spawning area. For the best results, make the spawner room a cuboid, with 4 blocks in between the monster spawner and each wall, and 1 block between the spawner and the ceiling, as well as between the spawner and the floor. You should now have a 9×3×9 area, with the spawner in the center.

When working with the cave spider spawning area, it is strongly recommended to seal off the area you're working with, so that you are not in danger of mobs other than cave spiders attacking.

### Collector

In this picture you can see the spawning area set up for a cave spider farm, with water flowing in several directions. Glowstone under the water indicate where a water source block should be placed, and in the picture the spawner is substituted for chiseled stone bricks.
Once the area around the cave spider spawner is all set up, you can start building your farm. Most farms have 2 basic components, the collector and the grinder. The collector is the area around the spawner, which collects the cave spiders, and moves them towards the grinder. The grinder is what kills the cave spiders. They are usually killed by either the player or an iron golem, because most sources of damage do not damage cave spiders.

The spawning area in a cave spider farm is generally the same as for other spawner-based traps. However, remember that cave spiders are smaller: they can fit through gaps 1 block wide and 1/2 block tall. Also, remember that they can climb walls.

One way to get the cave spiders to go into the grinder is by pouring water on every block on one side of the spawning area. Then, dig down 1 for every block on the opposite side, place a water source block on each side of the ditch, and place signs over each block in the ditch. Now, all the water should eventually flow to one block. If you want to make sure that the cave spiders don't climb the walls, place water sources all along the top of each wall.

The block where all the water flows into should connect to the grinder room (make another channel if needed). Remember that you can stop the flow of water, but still allow mobs and players to get through with signs.
