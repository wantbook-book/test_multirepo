## Endermen
Endermen can be annoying while in the End (more annoying than even creepers). They completely cover the island and are very hard to avoid looking at. Therefore, when traveling in the End, make sure to always carry a bucket of water. If an enderman tries to attack, place down the bucket where you are. It should walk into the water and then teleport away. It may also stop attacking‌[Java Edition  only], but even if it doesn't, it dies from the water. 

Another approach is to wear a pumpkin, and all the endermen ignore the player completely until the player attacks them. Unfortunately, the player can see only partially, but by pressing F5 (Ctrl + F5 or Fn + F5 on some computers), the player enters third-person mode, where the player can see fully again. Alternately, they can also toggle the HUD by pressing F1 to disable the blur caused by the pumpkin‌[Java Edition  only]. However, this makes the hotbar and hunger bars disappear too. The final option is to use a resource pack that changes the pumpkin blur.

in Java Edition, a useful tip to avoid accidentally looking at endermen is to show entity hitboxes by pressing F3 + B‌[Java Edition  only]. The white-colored hitboxes can help discerning endermen from the similarly colored purplish-black background of the End.

## Buildings
### The Home
In the End, there are many ways to build a home. If the player is on multiplayer, one idea is to build the house underground, so that other players cannot find them. Also, underground houses are easy to make.

Another option is to hollow out one of the obsidian pillars, making a multi-level building. This may take a significant amount of time, as obsidian takes a long time to mine. However, keep in mind that if you or another player respawn the ender dragon, the obsidian pillars regenerate, completely destroying your base.

Whether building or digging the home, the player must take measures against endermen spawning in it. The simplest tactic is to make sure that all ceilings are no more than 2 1⁄2 blocks high, so they don't have room to spawn or enter. Where this isn't practical, the player can make floors out of bottom slabs. Then, they can't spawn or teleport there, though they can still walk onto it if they have the headroom. In particular, if you want a secure roof, fence it and make it out of bottom slabs.

Note also the blocks that endermen can move. Because of this, the house should not be made of blocks that endermen can pick up, such as grass block. Instead, use stronger building blocks, such as any sort of stone or planks, that endermen can't move.

Also, the player can build a home in the outer islands where there are infinite islands.

### Portal Room
One thing the player should do is make a room or building for the end portal. This prevents the player from accidentally leaving the End, and also prevents endermen from falling through the portal and appearing in the Overworld. Note that if the player updates the portal by respawning the dragon, the ceiling of the portal room disappears.

#### Island outpost
This is similar to the main house, to be used as an overworld-like base in the process of respawning 19 ender dragons to complete the circle of gateways. When the player has killed the first dragon, they have unlocked a single end gateway to the outer end islands. The player is teleported to an outer island, where they can build a simple house, farm and fish pond—all of which are easy to make. This outpost is intended to have basic renewable resources in or around it, and can include a farm for both crops and trees, water and lava for a cobblestone generator, furnaces, methods of storage (such as a chest, barrel, shulker box or ender chest), a crafting table and a brewing stand if needed. The house should not have a bed, as it is nothing more than a hazard, and could be any size the player chooses. The farm must be lit up with a decent light source, or the crops are not successfully planted. The player is also advised to stock up on arrows and bows, as these are difficult to renew in the end.

Once the outpost is set up, the player may teleport to this house through the gateway when their health is critical during the process of killing the respawned ender dragon. If it is not a priority, it can consist of no more than a farm and hole-in-the-ground shelter. However, if the player plans to beat all 19 remaining dragons, the base can be extended into a fully self-sustaining presence, even providing iron for weapons and armor. Through great difficulty, Villagers may be transported to the outer island base (either by flying machine or pushing baby villagers through the gateway) and traded with for arrows, bows, and enchanted gear. Through a variety of creative loopholes, the outer island base may be expanded into a fortress so self-reliant that the player never has to leave.

#### The Dragon Egg
The player should also collect the dragon egg from the top of the portal. Before collecting it, the player should cover the portal with blocks, so when it drops it does not land in the portal and get sent to the Overworld world spawn point. After that, do not mine it. If the player does, the egg is teleport away. One way to get the egg is to place a piston facing toward it and activate the piston, causing it to drop as an item. If you make the egg fall onto a torch, it is in item form as the egg is affected by gravity, like sand and gravel. It is possible to mine the egg by making a large 30×30×15 cube of blocks with the egg in the center. You need to tunnel to the center and make the passage out of transparent blocks like doors or fence gates as the egg cannot teleport to these blocks. You can break the egg with your fist and it drops. This method is not recommended because it requires many stacks of blocks.

Although the dragon egg is purely ornamental, it is still nice to have in the base as an ornament to remind the player of when their journey in the End began.
