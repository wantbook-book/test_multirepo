#### Upside-down mobs
An example of a pig and a creeper being named "Dinnerbone".
|  | “ | Anything with my name in Minecraft is upside down, including myself. | „ |
|--|---|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
|  |   | — Dinnerbone                                                         |   |

As of Java Edition 1.6, any mob (with the exception of the ender dragon, squid and glow squid) named "Dinnerbone" or "Grumm" (case sensitive) through name tags, commands, or any other method, is rendered upside-down. The mob's behavior does not change.

This also applies to players, allowing Dinnerbone and Grumm's avatars to be rendered upside-down. This can be toggled using the "Show cape" button from "Skin Settings".[7] In Bedrock Edition, if the player names themselves Dinnerbone or Grumm, they are rendered upside-down. This works only if the player did not sign into Xbox Live.

#### Rainbow sheep
A sheep named "jeb_"
Naming a sheep "jeb_" using a name tag or a renamed spawn egg causes it to continually cycle through all colors a sheep can be dyed. When sheared using shears, however, the sheep drop wool of the original color of the sheep rather than the color that currently appears on the sheep. In Bedrock Edition, if a sheep is named jeb_, and then sheared, the leftover wool on its skin continues to cycle through all the colors.

#### 
A rabbit named "Toast"
When Ryan Holtz was developing rabbits, user xyzen420 asked him to make a skin that would look like his girlfriend's lost rabbit, Toast.[8] Now, naming a rabbit with a name tag or a rabbit spawn egg called "Toast" causes the rabbit's skin pattern to look like Toast as a memorial. This also works if the player attempts to name The Killer Bunny; although while the rabbit's appearance uses the Toast skin, it can still attack as it would without the given name. When the player is killed by the renamed Killer Bunny, the death message says "<playername> was slain by Toast". "Toast" is re-textured to have black spots on its fur.

#### 
If a vindicator is named "Johnny" or has its Johnny tag set to 1b, it attacks any nearby mobs except other illagers, zoglins, agents‌[Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education  only] and ghasts. This references the movie The Shining.

### Players
#### 
 

With the addition of the cape, Notch also added ears for the player deadmau5. The ears are "vanity items and are worn in addition to the player's skin", with the texture contained within deadmau5's skin.

deadmau5 cannot disable his ears, as a translucent part of the skin is automatically converted into a black color. His name tag is also programmed to render ten pixels higher to be above the ears.

The ears are set to show up based on the username, rather than the UUID of the player, meaning that if deadmau5 were to change his name, he would not keep his ears.

As a side effect of this easter egg, any entity with the name tag "deadmau5", including named mobs, has its name tag render ten pixels higher than a normal name tag.

## Splashes
### Never displayed splash
Within the "texts" folder, there is a text file named splashes.txt. The text file contains all the splashes that appear on the title screen. One of them is "This message will never appear on the splash screen, isn't that weird?" As its text implies, the splash is never displayed. However, in Legacy Console Edition it does display, but it has never been confirmed if it is a bug or an intentional feature.

### missingno splash
In older versions, if one were to delete the file splashes.txt without also deleting the META-INF folder, the splash text on the title screen would appear as "missingno". This is a reference to the infamous glitch Pokémon MissingNo. found in the first generation of Pokémon games. This was later changed to a zero-width no-break space, which is displayed with Minecraft's Unicode font as a box with the letters "ZWNBSP" within it.

The splash was added in Java Edition Alpha v1.0.12 and it's the only vanilla version with this splash by default since splashes.txt was not added yet.

- Splash in Alpha v1.0.12.
- The missingno splash in 1.13.2.
- The missingno splash in 19w12b.
- The missingno splash since 1.14 (19w13a).

### Holiday splashes
Special splashes appear all day on some holidays: "Happy new year!" on January 1, and "Merry X-Mas!" on Christmas Eve.

### Coronavirus
Special splashes are displaying due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They include "Wash your hands!" and "Support elderly relatives and friends!"

## Tributes to Technoblade
The crown on the pig.
Following the announcement on June 30, 2022 that popular Minecraft YouTuber Technoblade passed away from stage 4 cancer, Mojang added his skin’s crown to the pig on the Java Edition art in memory of him. A splash text "Technoblade never dies!" was also added in his honor in 1.19.1. The launcher art was later changed to reflect The Wild Update, removing the pig and the crown from the launcher.


## Removed Easter eggs
Several Easter eggs have been removed from Minecraft.

### Command blocks
Command blocks have various Easter eggs with messages being added to the previous output.

#### Searge says
If the command /help is run via command block, it gives various messages prefixed with "Searge says: " as the previous output when activated. The following messages exist:

- "Yolo"
- "/achievement take achievement.understandCommands @p"
- "Ask for help on twitter"
- "/deop @p"
- "Scoreboard deleted, commands blocked"
- "Contact helpdesk for help"
- "/testfornoob @p"
- "/trigger warning"
- "Oh my god, it's full of stats"
- "/kill @p[name=!Searge]"
- "Have you tried turning it off and on again?"
- "Sorry, no help today".

This no longer works in 1.13 or above (MC-124295); instead the /help command now runs normally, but the previous output gives only the last line ("/xp -> experience") due to there being space for just one line.
