#### E - H
- EditorialA place where people create several books on guides, tips, crafting recipes, etc.

- EmbassyMake other peoples' voices heard! Build offices that represents another server, a nearby city, or even mobs likevillagers,creepersorendermen!

- Enderman art showPutendermenin a room ofblocks they can pick up. After a set amount of days, see how they changed it! Players can bet on certain blocks being moved. Make sure that the endermen are kept in a glass cage, though, or players might anger them.  Make the room out of bedrock, as Endermen cannot teleport through them, and the glass only 2 blocks high as endermen cannot teleport through blocks that are shorter than them. Also remember that Endermen can despawn over time, unless they are named with a nametag.

- Execution aone- If somebody cheats or griefs, then you could have them put on trial and if they're found guilty, exile them, make them fight in the arena, or publicly carry out the death sentence in this place (Makes the most sense if it's a dictatorship OR medieval themed.)

- FarmHavecropsgrowing, with farmer villagers to take care of them. Raise and breedcows,chickens,pigs, andsheep. Sell the materials you get from the farm. You could sell animals as well.

- Fire stationGriefing protection is first and last, but yourwoodconstructions need a plan B. Fill a house withwater buckets, lots of splash and lingeringwater bottles, armor enchanted tofire protectionas well aspotions of fire resistance, andhorsesready to move out in maximum speed. If your city has aminecartnetwork or a channel network, you can use minecarts orboatsinstead. As an extra measure, you could have a button in all of the houses to call the fire station, connected with redstone. In the fire station, you could have a wall ofredstone torches, corresponding to the town's buildings, so when someone presses a fire button, the corresponding torch would turn off. Another way is to have a button in the fire station over the redstone torch connected to dispensers which floods the house with water. This is not a good idea since it washes away all mostredstoneand decoration blocks, but it saves your city from burning to the ground.

- Fountain– An aesthetic addition to any city. Hugely customizable, with many unique designs. Fountains can be used as a centerpiece, on tyrepath, in parks, in buildings, etc.

- GardenMake a big grassy area in the center of the town full oftrees,flowers, andtall grass. Use street lights along a road to keep hostiles from spawning. If you feel creative, construct a lookout tower with a spiraling staircase up to the top, which has a view of the whole city. You could also add attractions such as caves filled withoresand charge people for a guided tour. Be creative with it!

- Gas stationA place to buyminecarts,carrot on a stick, and 'snacks'. Make a duty so players must show what they're carrying. Build 'pumps' where you can get food for yourhorses,pigs, etc., (for transportation). For extra décor, you could even build a car wash at the gas station!

- Glass factoryA large room with small rooms with manyfurnacesandglassmanufacturing workers, you can also make automatic glass manufacturing withchests,hoppersandfurnaces.

- Great under-tier: This should be built at the bottom of the city. Add lots of factories, refineries, et cetera. This place is likely to be heavily polluted and can have many workers. Add large "disposal pipes" that eject waste or slag (unwanted trash like smelted stone) either out of the city or intolavapools andfiresor incinerators. Build large disposalfurnacesthat you can burn waste (or execute players) in.

- GymThis is where you could work out. Have a practice fighting area and a parkour challenge. You could connect it to the swimming pool and other areas.

- Hair salonMake a place withchestsand fill them with hair salon tools such asswordsorshearsfor scissors,water bottlesas hair gel, etc. Use "chairs" and make people who work there wear hairstylist suits. Addglassas mirrors so people can see how they look, and black dyedarmor(or any color) as the capes that keep your clothes from getting "hairy".

- Hall of craftingCreate a large building with displays of crafting recipes. Though this has little practical purpose after the introduction of therecipe book.

- Harbor/portCan only be built if your town is near the ocean or a river. It is useful if your town is spread across several islands. Craft boats and build giant ships. Charge money to rent a canoe or rowboat and charge even more if it breaks. You could also have a fishing area with shops selling fish and fishing rods.

- Hardware storeBuild a big building and fill it up with hardware materials such as wooden planks (in all colors), cobblestone, stone, etc., make the shelves high and use ladders to get to them easily. Have many checkouts with people manning them.

- Highway systemMake a highway system in your city! Make exits and entrances in the highway. If your city is a big one, you can make several highway roads around your city and you can have them connected to each other. These can also be used to connect two or more cities. A beltway would be useful for navigating around the city's outskirts. You can even dig a long tunnel under the center of the city.

- HospitalA place to care for injured players.  Fill it with beds, healing potions, surgery rooms, and so on.

This is an example of a hotel room in Minecraft, albeit a rather small one. It contains two beds, an iron door with a button, and several other accessories.
- HotelWhere players can sleep and reside away from home.
	- Food bar: Where hungry players can get something to eat. If you want you can have a "Food of the Day" or "Food of the Week", and maybe specials for the different times.
	- Rooms: Obviously, the hotel rooms! Put in "dressers" (seeTutorials/Furniturefor how to do that), chests for guests to put their luggage, a TV, some couches, perhaps a bathroom, and beds. Add an iron door to the entrance and put a wall around it with abutton, so players can access a room with an authority. However, if you want more privacy in the rooms, consider using dark oak, spruce or birch doors instead, as they don't have windows in them. Don't forget to put an obvious button,leverorpressure plateon the inside of the room, or players won't be able to get out without an authority.
	- Swimming pool and spa: For the pool, remember to have a shallow end (players can touch the ground without going underwater), a drop-off (where the water gets deeper), and a deep end. For a hot tub, remember to have a seat along the edge andwaterwith no current. This is where players can go to relax. For a more realistic hot tub, placesoul sandat the bottom of or under the floor of the pool, so it createsbubble columnsin the water.
	- Minecart with Chest: Some players are willing to carry their luggage all the way to their rooms, but others, well, others don't want to haul their luggage around. Place a fewminecartswithchestsbetween the 2 entrances in the hotel. Have an authority send the minecart that leads to your room out. After all, only they know which minecart leads to your room.
	- Stairs: Makestairsleading to the floors. You can do simple stairs, or you can do fancy spiral staircases. Make sure to add railings. The last thing you want is for your first customer to be your last customer because of falling to their death at the hotel!
	- Elevators: If you do not wish to use the stairs you can just use the elevator! it could be a series ofpistons, for example, so the only walking you'll have to do is from one piston to the next.
