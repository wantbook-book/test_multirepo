# Tutorials/Ultra hardcore survival
If you have played Hardcore mode many times and are comfortable with it, and want an even bigger challenge, try Ultra Hardcore Mode. Ultra Hardcore mode is like Hardcore, but to add to the challenges of hardcore, you don't naturally regenerate health. This difficulty is extreme, so it is advised to try hardcore mode first to gain extensive experience, and move on to this difficulty when you think you are ready.

All the rules of regular Hardcore still apply, so read them first.

## Creating a UHC World
To play on Ultra Hardcore, you must first create a Hardcore world. There are two ways to make a Hardcore world a UHC world. For the first method, once the world has finished generating, open the pause menu, click the open to LAN option, and turn on the allow Cheats option, before clicking the "Start LAN World" button. Once this is done, exit the menu and enter the following command into the chatbox: /gamerule naturalRegeneration false. Once you have completed these steps, save and exit to the title screen, before returning to the game. For the second method, click create new world in Java Edition 1.16 or above, and set gamemode to Hardcore. Next, click game rules, and select natural regeneration to make it false. Once you have done that, click create world. Now you have successfully created your own Ultra Hardcore world.

## Notes and tips
Ultra Hardcore Mode, like mentioned earlier, is very difficult to survive when playing, and if you die, your map will only be available for spectating. Therefore, it's important to know how to avoid dying. Here are some tips:

- First of all, as stated before, there is no natural health regeneration. So, remember to avoid even the most pathetic ways of getting damaged, such as being spat on by allamaor touching cactus.
- You'll have to be really quick with getting resources, because no regeneration makes taking damagemuchmore dangerous.
- Find ingredients to make agolden apple, apotion of Healing,suspicious stewwith regeneration (crafted withoxeye daisies), or apotion of Regenerationas quick as possible, as these are some of the few ways to regenerate health in UHC.
- Although hard and labor-intensive to acquire, abeaconcan make your life significantly easier, along with reducing the amounts of potions and apples you may consume.
- Remember hunger is the most crucial part of survival. Even without regenerating health, a full food bar is necessary for sprinting and preventing starvation damage. As with a normal survival,get food quickly. Hunger is a pitiful excuse for taking damage.
- Keep a water bucket on your hotbar at all times. Falling and fire damage can be reduced by using a water bucket.

## Tips that apply to PvP
- A great way to check out if there are any players in the vicinity is to trap yourself in a small capsule. The lack of lighting causes everything to be dark except for name tags, which are now more visible than regularly.
- Goldandapplesare going to be your top priorities. Apples can be found on the surface and dropped from oak leaves, likesaplings. In many cases you'll have more apples than gold.
- While waiting for your items to smelt, consider farminggravelto gain enoughflintto craftarrows.
- With the addition ofsuspicious stewto Minecraft, regeneration is much easier to get. Considering how mushroom biomes remain one of the safest environments, and the ease of growing flowers, suspicious stew may serve as an excellent early game healing item, and a much cheaper alternative to potions, albeit not nearly as effective.
- Consider checking out YouTubers or Twitch streamers to see their UHC strategies.
- The game usually goes up to 1-2 hours, so make sure you have enough water beside you and some snacks if necessary. Go to the restroom beforehand.
- Check the rules before going into a game of UHC. Some may have player head apple and strength/regen disabled, so you might just want to read it before joining.
- Strength is extremely beneficial (if not disabled) as you can deal a lot more damage with it. Speed is another handy potion as you'll be able to go 20% or 40% faster.
- NEVER GO AFK! You don't want to come back and realize you got killed.

## Beginning
There are a lot of options of what you can do play singleplayer UHC, but if you want to survive, you generally want to either not take much damage, or get a lot of materials to heal with. 

### The Overworld
When you start, get only 3 logs. Make a crafting table and wooden pickaxe. Go to the nearest stone and mine 3 blocks. Make a stone pickaxe, then mine around 10 blocks to make sword , shovel and axe. Mine 10 more stone and make a hoe and furnace. As you move, kill passive mobs and try to get 12 pieces of meat and 3 wool. Get 5 more logs and make a chest and bed. If you find coal or iron, mine it. Try to get at least one wheat seed, and till the ground next to water and plant the seed. If you have wood, make a stack of torches.

When night falls, it is safer to go mining unless you have already built a house with a bed. Try to get at least a stack of iron and a stack of coal. Get some gold for a golden apple and a clock. Get some redstone and lapis lazuli. If you get diamonds, make a diamond pickaxe and mine 14 obsidian. Craft a shield, a bucket, an iron sword and pickaxe, iron armor, an anvil, and an enchanting table if you have the resources. If you have more iron, make a second bucket and a pair of shears.

Once you finish mining, you can go up and gather more logs and expand your farm. Once you have gathered materials, you should make a bigger base. The base should be able to fit all your chests, furnaces, crafting tables, and everything you need. Build an animal pen and expand your wheat farm. Get oxeye daisies, both types of mushrooms, and a bowl to make suspicious stew for healing. Once you have enough gold, make a golden apple, keep it in your hotbar, and never remove it. It will save your life at some point.

After you've gathered basic materials, you should probably either continue caving or go to the Nether.
