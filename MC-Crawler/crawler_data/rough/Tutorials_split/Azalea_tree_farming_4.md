### Farming acacia
Acacia trees require six blocks of space from the sapling to the ceiling, if there is any, and at least two empty blocks to each wall. So the minimum space that an acacia tree requires to grow is an empty rectangular cuboid over the sapling of 6(height) × 5(wide) × 5(long) blocks.

### Farming small jungle trees
Using the same spacing as a birch farm, one can grow individual jungle tree saplings as small jungle trees. Without fortune enchantments, a single tree would not produce enough saplings to replace itself. A 3×3 grid of trees growing will usually produce enough saplings to replace itself in the long term, and occasionally produces 1-2 excess saplings. After 6-7 real life hours of hovering over the farm, cutting down, and replacing trees as they grow, a profit of about 10-20 saplings can be accumulated this way. A starting supply of 9 planted saplings and 18 back stock for the eventual stretch of losses is necessary to keep the initial tree grid planted at all times. After enough iterations, the ultimate result is a profit in jungle saplings.

### Farming huge fungi
** Nylium Platform **
Huge fungi require Bone Meal, Nylium and Fungi to farm. You can make a platform of nylium, apply bonemeal until it generates fungi, then quickly grow the fungi and break the bottom stem to prevent the nylium from decaying.  Cut down the fungus, and break the vegetation and nether wart blocks that generate and compost them, along with all the non-fungus vegetation that generates with using the bone meal on the nylium. With luck, you can get enough bone meal to do it all over again. You can always farm some other vegetation to produce enough bone meal to make sure you do not run out.

** Nether exploration **
Collecting huge fungi blocks in their own biomes is a great way to collect a sufficient amount of wood and decorative blocks early game. 

The fastest way to use this method is to make an efficiency 5 netherite axe and hoe, then travel to the nether and fly around using an elytra until you come across a warped or crimson forest. If it's a crimson forest, be sure to bring warped fungus to repel hoglins (must be planted, with an area of effect of 15 blocks). 

After planting a fungus, build a 3×3 platform of gold blocks with a beacon on top for the haste 1 effect. Fly up from the beacon base and destroy the netherrack obstructing the beacon beam. The haste 1 effect reduces the mining time per stem block by 2gt.  

This also helps when mining wart blocks and shroomlights, as when combined with an efficiency 3 netherite or diamond hoe, you can mine each block in 1gt. Setting up and removing a 1 layer beacon in the nether takes on average 600gt, so this beacon method is effective only if you are mining more than 300 stem blocks, or if it is necessary for instant mining more than 38 blocks. 

Once the beacon is set up, you can begin harvesting trees. Huge Fungi normally generate together in clumps, so it's best to climb to the top using twisting vines, and then mine from the top down. Be sure to use a hoe to mine the leaf blocks (wart blocks and shroomlights), and your axe to harvest the stems.

After growing the Fungus
To marginally increase speed, carry with you a few shulker boxes of unbreaking 3, efficiency 5, gold axes to reduce the mining speed by 1gt per stem block. 

** Greenhouse **
Place 2 nylium in a 3×3 grid pattern with 6 blocks in between each one. Then construct a water stream platform beneath it. Have the water stream funnel the items into a chest storage, connected by a hopper. To use the manual farm, place down a fungus on each nylium block, then grow the fungi using bone meal. Now climb to the top using ladders, a bubble column, scaffolding or vines, and mine out the huge fungi from the top down. After harvesting the huge fungi, collect any items that didn't drop into the water stream below.

** Semi-automatic **
Semi-automatic harvesting is when everything in a farm is self-sufficient except for the input. 

In the case of semi-automatic huge fungi farms, this would be the placement of fungi plants and often, but not always, supplying it with bone meal.

The positives of a semi-automatic design, is that they're fast, inexpensive to construct, lag friendly on small scales, and produces every block from the tree (wart blocks, shroomlights and weeping vines included).

### 
This is a nether tree farm designed by ncolyer dubbed as "The Menace". The design is fairly complex but to simplify, it uses TNT dupers to destroy the logs and pistons to destroy the wart blocks. A modified design includes a system to convert byproducts such as vines, wart blocks and shroomlights to bonemeal to fully AFK the farm without the worry of running out of bonemeal. In all, it produces 80,000 logs per hour.

### Farming mangrove
Mangrove trees are really tall, and require a horizontal footprint of 13 by 13 blocks to grow fully. They are very difficult to harvest from the ground up, because their log usually starts a few blocks above the ground, and the logs branch in all sorts of different directions, which is very hard to trace when digging through the leaves. Therefore, the best way to mine these trees manually is a top-down approach. However, these trees are usually very tall and difficult to get on top of. Despite this difficulty, mangrove trees possess a unique trait that stands out among other trees: they can be planted underwater.

To farm these trees underwater, find a flat lakebed or ocean floor that is at least 10 blocks deep, place the mangrove propagule in the middle, and use bone meal on it. The tree will grow, and you can easily swim to the top and start harvesting it downwards. Because you will stay underwater for long periods of time, a helmet with Aqua Affinity or a conduit might be helpful. Because mangrove leaves do not drop saplings, There is no point to wait for all of them to decay before you plant the next tree, so you can simply mine out all the logs and mangrove roots, and then start planting the next tree.

Because mangrove propagules can be easily obtained by using bone meal on mangrove leaves, you can simply harvest a bunch of propagules, then start planting new trees without worrying about propagule collection at all.
