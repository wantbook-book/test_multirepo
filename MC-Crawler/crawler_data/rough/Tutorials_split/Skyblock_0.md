# Tutorials/Skyblock
Skyblock is one of the most popular survival gamemodes. The idea is that you can create and expand your very own world infinitely with only minimal materials. It was originally created by Noobcrew, a veteran Minecraft player.

You start on a small island floating in the middle of void with a few items and a single tree and you must learn to use and preserve your materials wisely as each one has a strategic use, (for example lava buckets), and to know the basics of Minecraft in order to complete challenges and to expand. It is normal to make beginner mistakes, sometimes requiring many restarts.

There are countless Skyblock maps that can be found over various Minecraft community websites. You can also play online by choosing a Skyblock multiplayer server. Skyblock is widely known as being the most popular map and gamemode ever created on Minecraft while being highly popular for almost a decade, with gameplay and tutorials from just about every Youtuber including MrBeast, PewDiePie, CaptainSparklez and others.

## Global Progression
Since there is no normal terrain to explore, setting up farms for resources is vital to game progression.

### Your first day
Your first day will mainly depend on the skyblock map. If you have any grass or flowers, mine them and try to get at least one seed. Then, break the dirt on your island, leave at least a few grass blocks. Place the dirt around the tree so that it catches the dropped saplings. Chop down the tree and make a crafting table and wooden pickaxe. Catch the saplings and replant them. If you have a chest, open it and check the items. You usually start out with a few crops like sugar cane, melons, and pumpkins, some obsidian for a portal. Some maps also give you 2 turtle eggs, although turtles can spawn in a beach biome if the map has different biomes. There is also a bucket of lava and ice. To make a cobblestone generator, dig a one block deep T-shaped hole. Put a block in the center, water and lava on two others slots. Break the center block, get in the last slot, and break the cobblestone that forms. Make sure that the blocks that surround the lava are not flammable, or they will burn. Mine as much cobblestone as you can and make a full set of stone tools. Make a small shelter out of wood or cobblestone to prevent phantoms and other monsters.

### Crops and Trees
If you start with crops, plant them around the water at your cobblestone generator. For your second and third day, you want to gather as much wood and cobblestone as you can. If you have an oak tree, you can get apples for your food. If you started with a melon, make melon seeds and plant them. If you get a melon block, you can break it for melons, which you can also eat.

### Mob Farm
Hostile mob farms are very important because they are a source of bones, strings, redstone dust, iron ingots, potatoes and carrots, among many other drops. Building a mob farm is mandatory to get the crops to start crop farming. It is also an abundant source of rotten flesh, which you can now eat instead of apples. Multiple mob farms designs are explained in the page Tutorials/Mob farm, however, the vast majority of efficient designs need water or redstone circuits.

If a spider spawns, killing it for string will allow you to craft a fishing rod, which can be used in the water from your cobblestone generator to obtain early-game fish as food.

This hostile mob farm design shown by ilmango uses the mob pathfinding mechanics to lure them into a drop shaft, without the need of water or redstone circuits (note that spiders can't spawn in this farm) :

You should also make a temporary passive mob farm to get animals: to do that, use cobblestone to bridge away from your island, and hope a passive mob spawns.

### Crop Farm
You can get wheat from the seeds at the start of your island. Along with melon and potato seeds. Killing skeletons will yield bones which can be converted to bonemeal, in order to quickly grow crops in the beginning. On higher versions of Minecraft, killing zombies will also drop carrots and potatoes, which you can farm as well as lure and breed pigs.

### Getting Water
Water is extremely useful in a Skyblock world for many uses, and allows you to pillar down easily for building or to save you from death. It is also used to irrigate farmland. 

Bonemeal underwater to make sea grass to turn flowing water into water sources.

An ice block can be broken by hand to create flowing water.

By using two sources of water, usually included in a chest or as ice blocks apart of the island, you can create an infinite water source. Dig a 2×2 hole 1 block deep, place two water sources in opposite corners, and the merging flows will create new water source blocks.  Use a bucket on any of the now-four water blocks, and the removed water will be replaced by a new water source block when the flows merge.  If the source blocks are too far apart, the merging flows will be too weak to create a source block, and so cannot become infinite.

Another option is placing a cauldron below open sky and waiting for rain, which will very slowly fill the cauldron with water. When the cauldron is full, you can empty it with a bucket. With 2 buckets worth of water, you can make an infinite water source. If you're playing on versions above 1.13, you can also use Bone Meal in water to spawn seagrass and more water sources, which you can then pick up with a bucket.
