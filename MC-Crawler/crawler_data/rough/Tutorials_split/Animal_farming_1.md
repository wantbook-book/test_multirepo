### Breeding tips
Breeding twice doubles the population of the animals if the offspring are not included in the equation. Killing half the animals after breeding keeps the population stable with maximum product.

When breeding large amounts of animals in a fenced pen, it can be difficult to leave the pen without animals escaping. Some ways to deal with this:

- Go to the opposite side of the pen as the door you intend to use, and pull out the appropriate food, to gather the animals there. Then switch items (putting the food away) and quickly run to the gate. Because they no longer follow you, the animals are not fast enough to get to the other side of the pen when you do. This gets more difficult with large crowds, so other methods may be necessary.
- Placingcarpetson a fence allows players to get in and out without mobs doing the same.
- A double gate can provide an "airlock" to give you a chance to intercept any animals that follow you through the first gate.

Most of these farms include a killing mechanism, a cooking mechanism for the meat and an item collector, usually a hopper. The cooking mechanism and killing mechanism are often combined, in the form of lava or fire.

### Lava blade
This design is mostly used with cows, pigs and sheep. It uses a sticky piston water gate to control the amount of animals to be cooked. They drop through a "lava blade", which enables their meat to be cooked efficiently. Note that this does not work on rabbits due to their small size and jumpiness.

### Simple redstone activated cooked meat farm
- Function: This is an easy farm to setup that just requires breeding and can be activated with the press of a button, making the process highly efficient, cooking directly meat and collecting it. This farm works for cows, sheep and pigs.

- Construction:

1. Construct a holding area with flowing water for the adults, a collection area for the baby animals with a 1 block high entrance and a sign to block the water flow from the adult area
2. The collection area should be only 1 block in area, consisting of a hopper connected to a chest, and a dispenser holding a bucket of lava facing into the collection area, with two separateredstone wiresconnected to it.
3. One redstone wire must be connected to threerepeatersset to 4, 4 and 3 ticks. On the other wire, there must be only one set to default (one tick). Both of the leads must connect up to astone button.

- Preparation:

1. Lead animals into the holding area before adding flowing water.
2. Breed them until you have the correct amount. This amount can be adjusted, however, adding too many adults may impede progress of babies being swept into the collection area.

- Usage:

1. Breed the amount of animals you need. Let them fall into the collection area and wait until they grow. Activate the dispenser and collect the drops from the chest.

### Fully automatic chicken cooker
- Function: This machine is inexpensive and fully automatic, making it a great source ofcooked chickenandfeathers.

- Construction:

1. Dig a one block wide, two blocks deep hole in the ground. Place a chest on the bottom and a hopper over it. On top of the hopper, place a non-flammable slab and build non-flammable walls around the slab, at least 3 blocks high.
2. Remove a block in the wall next to the slab and place a dispenser, connected to a power source, such as a comparator to detect eggs inside and fire them. Place at least one hopper on top of the dispenser. It should reach as high as the wall surrounding the slab.
3. Place lava onto the block above the slab.
4. Place a hopper connected to the dispenser, and build a roof, making sure to put torches inside of the area before closing it off. Add a trapdoor to add chickens.

- Preparation:

1. Gather as many eggs as you can or will, the more the merrier.
2. Open the trap door and throw all of the eggs in. Some of them should hatch into baby chickens and start wandering above the hopper.

- How it works: The chickens above the hopper, when grown up,  start laying eggs, which are transported through the hopper into the dispenser, which shoots them onto the slab, hatching them. The baby chickens are not tall enough to get burnt by the lava that is directly above their heads, so the chickens won't be burnt until they grow up. The drops are picked up by the hopper under the slab and deposited into the chest below.

### Steakatron 2000


- Construction:

1. Start with adouble chestat the desired front. Place a 2×2 grid ofhopperspointing into the chest behind it. Above the chest, place a 2×2 of glass or other transparent block.
2. Make a rear wall of glass. For each side, add two pillars of opaque blocks 3 high.
3. Make the top front block on each side adispenserpointing inward with abuttonon front of it. Place awater bucketinside the left one, and alava bucketin the right one.
4. Placesignsinside at ground level on the 4 internal walls of the blocks. This holds the lava above the heads of the animals.
5. Make stairs running up to the roof for the left side. Add a roof made by ring of stairs around the outside and attaching fourtrapdoorsto the bottom of the side stairs directly above the internal space.

- Preparation:

1. Lead yourcowsinside by holding wheat and standing on top opposite the stairs with the trapdoors open, then close all trapdoors and get down. Kill any remaining cattle by hand.

- Usage:

1. Pick wheat off the chest and breed all the cows. Close all trapdoors when done.
2. Decide whether you wantraw beef(for trading with butchers) orsteak(also known as cooked beef on BE) (for eating). Press the appropriate button, wait for the adults to die, then press the button again. If you needexperience, you can open the trapdoors and slaughter them by hand.

If cattle is needed elsewhere, leave the trapdoors open and hit the water button until a sufficient number have escaped.
