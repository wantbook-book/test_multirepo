## Lava minecart entrance































Lava minecart hidden entrance
When entering a minecart, the player instantly teleports. Additionally, minecarts can be entered through lava. These mechanics can be exploited to get through a stream of lava. To build it, first, build an entrance and cover it with lava. Try to make it look like a natural lavafall. Behind the lava, place a rail and put a minecart on it. If in survival, be careful not to get burned by the lava.


## Lava trapdoor






























Lava and water entrance
This entrance can be a bit dangerous, especially if the player is low on health. As shown in the schematic, after the player goes into the lava, they sink through, fall past the signs, and into the water. This design can be expanded or shrunk as needed, however it may be tricky to make it more than 2 blocks wide. To ensure your health will not run out with your difficulty settings and armor, it may be a good idea to test it for the first time with Fire Resistance. Some good hiding places for this: a beat up house with a single bucket of lava on the floor; a natural lava pool; in a decorational lava pool.


## Corner door entrance































Corner hidden entrance.
This door uses the fact that a wooden door when opened covers up the wall it is against. This works best with spruce, birch, dark oak, crimson, and warped doors as they cannot be seen through. It sometimes works best in a small closet, but be aware that if made too obvious, other players may discover it.

## Opening mechanisms
Every good secret door has an equally great secret opening mechanism. Some doors, such as the painting door, do not require an opening mechanism. Others however, such as the classic Jeb door, require a redstone trigger to open.

### Jukebox trigger
See also: Jukebox § Redstone component

This trigger can be completely hidden except for a jukebox. When a player selects and inserts the correct disc, it opens the door. When a comparator is placed next to a jukebox, it can produce a redstone signal which is unique for each disc. This method essentially acts as a key or password, since the player must use the correct disc to access the door. In addition, a jukebox is typically used as decoration rather than a redstone component, leading to a better hidden entrance. The only problem with this, however, is that the door will remain open for the duration of the song (the disc is automatically ejected from the jukebox afterwards) or until another player removes the disc.




### Arrow plate trigger
Using a hidden wooden pressure plate, an arrow can be fired at a predetermined location, activating a door. As arrows despawn after 1 minute, the secret doorway can close automatically. If this 1 minute period is too long, pressure plates can be added inside the door to close it prematurely. It can be difficult to hide a pressure plate. Some ideas include behind a waterfall, under a lava pool, or in a fake minefield.

Another way is to place a pressure plate diagonally to a corner of a wall. When the player shoots the arrow, the pressure plate will detect the arrow through the wall, therefore opening the secret entrance.

### Lava fishing trigger
Similar to the above, this opening mechanism uses a fishing rod and a lava pool instead of a bow and arrows. To create it, place a wooden pressure plate under a lava pool and connect it with redstone dust to a secret door. To open the door, fish onto the pressure plate and try to not look conspicuous. If the fishing bobber hits the plate, the plate should trigger the redstone, opening the door. The advantage of this over using arrows is that the door closes when you retract the bobber. Once you get good at it, the door can be opened and closed rather quickly. Additionally, other players are unlikely to waste their fishing rod's durability by fishing in lava. If someone asks why you are fishing in lava, you could use an excuse such as "I wanted to see if fishing rods burn if you fish in lava" or "I wanted to see if I could catch fish in lava" or even "I wanted to fish my pet magma cube out of the lava!" You can't fish in lava in 1.16 at least in Bedrock Edition in my experience.

### Daylight trigger
The daylight sensor can be used to open a door only at a certain time. This works well with piston doors such as a half Jeb door. Since it is unlikely you want the door to be in plain sight when open, this may be best combined with other mechanisms to use the daylight sensor as a lock. For example, the daylight sensor could be used to open a door behind a painting. It does restrict when the player can open the door, however. This could cause problems with frequent use.
