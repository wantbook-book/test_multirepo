#### Not converting villagers to reduce prices
Curing villagers can make them reduce prices and make things cheaper. It is a good idea to cure a zombie villager when you have the resources. If the trades are expensive, cure them multiple times, like infecting them and curing them. Do not do this on Easy or Normal difficulty as the villager has a 100% or 50% chance respectively to die from a zombie attack instead of being converted.

#### Wasting arrows
Until the player has a large collection of arrows, has built a mob farm or skeleton dungeon grinder, or has the Infinity enchantment on their bow, they should use their arrows sparingly. Arrows are best used for more dangerous mobs such as skeletons, creepers, and witches. Enemies such as zombies are not as hard to kill with melee combat so the player can save their arrows by not using them on these easier mobs. Sometimes, exceptions should be made with easier mobs, such as when a zombie is burning or their sword is enchanted. Situations such as these in which the player is in extra danger may warrant the need to use a bow. Passive mobs pose no threat to the player and thus have no need to be killed from afar. A special case is the enderman, which is immune to arrows and always teleports away from them.

#### Coal blocks
Nine pieces of coal burn for 720 seconds in total, while a block of coal, which can be crafted with 9 coal, burns for 800 seconds. This gives the player one free coal's worth of burn time.

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Coal        |                 |

Besides, blocks of coal are more efficient for the inventory. This is also called compacting (compacting also works for diamonds, redstone, lapis lazuli, gold, iron, emeralds and more).

Do not use blocks to smelt only a few items. Whole blocks are consumed at a time, so only use coal block when you are smelting more than 72 items(9 coal*8 items for each coal). For only a few items, it's a good idea to just put in any number of coal.

#### Not using hay bales to heal horses when available
Similar to the above involving the 9 coal and the block of coal, each wheat crop can heal a horse 2 health; however, an entire bale of hay can heal a horse 20 Ã— 10 health, and hay bales are crafted with only 9 wheat. Effectively, this heals the player's horse an extra 2 health.

Plus, just like how blocks of coal store 9 coal, hay bales act as a storage unit for wheat, as 9 wheat can be crafted from one hay bale.

The only exception to this is if the player's horse lost only about a few health points, they should not feed the horse hay bales and instead feed it wheat, as the horse does not need the extra health.

#### Getting blue dye from lapis lazuli
Some players who have lapis lazuli use it for dyeing, but lapis lazuli is mainly used for enchanting. Blue dye can be obtained from a simple cornflower, not from a lapis lazuli, which can be only obtained from mining underground dangerously. Cornflower can be found nearly everywhere, from grassy plains to flower forests. They can also be grown by using bone meal on a grass block, which has a chance of sprouting a cornflower other than grass.

Using lapis lazuli as a dye is a waste of resources and should not be used.

## Superflat worlds
Only Java Edition and Legacy Console Edition players need to know these because in Bedrock Edition you need to use add-ons if you want custom superflat worlds.

### 
When doing a survival world, the player should avoid creating a superflat world with water as the only block preset. This setting does not generate land. The player swims and eventually drowns, or runs out of food and starves to death. A superflat world with just water can be boring. The player can use this preset for making a Creative Mode world, to enjoy painful experiences such as Dark Souls, or to have set certain structures to spawn within the world.

### 
When doing a survival world, the player should avoid creating a superflat world with lava as the only block preset. This setting does not generate any land besides bedrock in Legacy Console Edition. your character eventually burns to death. If you do it in Creative mode, you could make a parkour course or lava islands like in the Nether.

## Other
The following things to not do in Minecraft do not fit any of the categories listed above. Still, they are equally important.

### Setting a spawnpoint in the End
It is possible to set a spawnpoint in the End using commands. However, doing so provides no easy way out. Dying or going through the portal sends you back to the spawn point, which is the End. The only way to get out is by executing a teleport command in the Overworld or the nether or by going out through a nether portal placed by commands, since nether portals are disabled in the End. The player can also use /setblock ~ ~ ~ end_portal to get out, or building a end portal and jumping into it in the end can teleport the player back into the overworld where the spawnpoint can be set again.

### Placing your bed under an end portal
Setting your respawn point under an active end portal means that if you die, you respawn in your bed and immediately get teleported through the end portal, leaving you stuck in the End dimension forever unless cheats are on.

### Building weak or flammable structures
The player should avoid building with dirt, sand, snow, and netherrack, because they are weak materials with a low Blast Resistance, unless it's a temporarily structure or as a temporary base (creepers cannot blow if there is a one block wall between the player and the creeper). They are easily destroyed by creepers or TNT. Instead, the player should use cobblestone, which is a cheap, abundant, and tough alternative. Later on in the game, the player may want to make their main base out of more varied blocks.

A list of low blast-resistance materials can be found here.

Players with the ability to have infested blocks in their inventory (such as in creative mode) should be careful not to use them for most building projects as they release silverfish when broken.

Wooden houses are quite flammable. It is a common sight to see a Griefer burning down wood structures on Minecraft servers.
Although wood is flammable, it has a decent blast resistance and is efficient to collect in large quantities. A stack of wood blocks can be harvested at the same time as a stack of cobblestone, but yields four times as many blocks when crafted into wooden planks. For large constructions, such as mob traps, wood planks are a good choice. Wooden roofing may be easy and look nice, but it is vulnerable to being set on fire by lightning. Either the player should make the roof in a fireproof material or have a fireproof layer beneath to limit the spread of fire. In 1.17, a lightning rod can avoid this problem.
