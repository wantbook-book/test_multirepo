### Shelves
An Aquarium
To make a shelf, place a row of 4 wood planks on the ground, and add a stack of 3 wood planks at each end. Close off the space at the top with 2 more planks. Finally, add slabs in the middle of all of the wood planks to simulate shelves.

You can make a modern shelf by placing carpet on top of one another.

### Potted plant
A plant vase using bamboo and jungle leaves.
Note: As of Java Edition 1.4.2, there are now flower pots made out of three bricks crafted the same way as a Bucket, making this method not quite as useful. However, this method still remains useful for 2-block high plants, as they can't be placed into flower pots.

If you don't want to use a flower pot, either for the reason that you want to have a 2-block high plant in your pot or just a different type of flower pot, read on.

Place a grass block. You may also get a long grass, a rose, a yellow flower, or any of the other new 1-block-high plants. 

Next, dig out the blocks around it on the floor.

Above each hole, place a trapdoor. Then make them all in the closed position, with its flat side against the side of the dirt block. After that, fill in the holes. Then put dirt or a stone block, tall grass piece, or fern on top of the dirt block and you're done!

Another way to make potted plants is to put signs around a block of dirt as the pot and then put a plant on top of it.

### Desks
To make a desk, take your choice of support, (Fence or fence gate look the best) and place 2 of them for a freestanding desk, 1 for a desk attached to the wall. Then make a surface (wooden slabs work well). Pressure plates or carpets can be also placed on fences, creating a much flatter surface. Additionally, if three fence blocks are placed in a row, two could be covered in pressure plates, and one with glowstone or a redstone lamp on top, making a "lamp".

Another neat way of making easy and simple desks is to have a set of pistons lined up in patterns in rectangular shapes or lines. Simply place redstone blocks in the shape of your desk one block beneath your floor. Then place pistons atop the blocks for a permanent desk/table. Another way to make a desk is after the pistons are placed, put a single redstone torch under each one of them, causing the pistons to activate, and thus making a quick and simple table. An adaptation of this is to put a piston in the ground facing up and put pressure plates around it. When you walk up to it, the table/desk pops up.

A different way of making desks is to make a huge table out of blocks. There should be four "leg" blocks, acting as the "legs" of your table. On top of the "legs" you can put slabs or blocks, making a simple table. This form of table is one of the easiest to make.

The last type of table is the "Block-by-block" table. It consists of a simple arrangement of multiple blocks. By putting many blocks in a rectangular, square, or straight pattern, you can make a simple table useful for keeping things on. This form of table is mostly built with white, plain wool, because it causes the table to look like the table is covered with a clean, white tablecloth.

Another way to make a good looking desk is to place two upside down stairs on the ends with slabs between them, the stairs act as the legs. And if you want to have a top table cloth but still a wood table then put white carpet on top of the wood blocks.

### Computers
Place a block of iron, a painting on the side, and a "keyboard" in front of it. Some people use a powered minecart rail, mostly because it looks like there's buttons on it in the original resource pack. Best use with a desk. Some people put an item frame with an apple on the back to brand it as an Apple iMac! You can use 3×2×1 logs and put the "computer" in the middle. Alternatively, there are several mods that can provide you with computers. A good example is ComputerCraft or the Mr. Crayfish's furniture mod. 

Basic Computer on a desk with a chair.
Another way is to place a painting on the wall in front of a block of wood and place a minecart rail or another object that looks like a computer keyboard and you can use that as a computer. When you want to 'change the display' just put a new picture in place. A really good way of making a keyboard is digging a one block deep hole, and then putting a carpet on it. Then, put two armor stands facing forward on the left and right side of the hole. Using pistons, push the armor stands into the hole. Now push a quartz block downward repeatedly (again, using a piston) until it reaches ground level. There you have it, a keyboard.

Another way to make a computer is by placing a wooden or stone pressure plate. From the outside (or rear of the 'desk'), place a sign on the edge of the pressure plate (check for the black outline showing the plate as selected). This sign can be decorated with common logos, like real monitors. Now, move to the front of the 'desk' (or back of the sign, which is now floating) and place a picture. An optional button can be placed on the left or right as a mouse. Two of these screens can be setup (the pressure plate is required to hold the sign) for dual monitor configurations.

Alternatively, you can use the item frame method to set up a computer. Place an oak wood block next to the wall. Above it on the wall put an item frame. On the wood block, put a stone pressure plate and there you have it! You can put a map or an item (heads are good ones) inside to make it look like you are running a program. You can also expand by putting another block of wood on one side of the first one and placing a empty flower pot on one and a button of any type on the other. You now have a laptop with some coffee and a mouse!

To make a disk drive, place a jukebox close to a wall and place a stone or wooden pressure plate on the jukebox. Add a picture on the wall and then place any block beside the jukebox and place a lever on it. Now you have a computer that can play music!


Griefer's trick: Add a TNT trap with a dropper and a wooden pressure plate hidden and a trapdoor to open the computer system and add a book to the dropper. You can use them as 'viruses' to wreck their computer. Add a button next to the dropper to turn it 'on'. Add a command block next to the pressure plate “hidden” and set the command to: /me ERROR! VIRUS ERROR!. When a player has turned 'on' their computer, the ERROR! alert will make the player think there is a virus and then the computer will explode! 

One way is to put a block of any kind with a painting on. Underneath put a pressure plate as a keyboard and use stairs as a desk chair. There are many other ways that you can make them please comment below to help other players! :)
