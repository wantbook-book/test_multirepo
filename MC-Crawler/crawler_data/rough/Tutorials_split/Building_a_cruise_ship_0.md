## Cruise ships
Large cruise ships are usually very large and complex, and therefore may be quite difficult and tedious to build. It is recommended to build these in Creative mode, as a very large number of resources, some of which may be hard to acquire in Survival or Adventure, are usually needed to create a large cruise ship.

### Recommended building blocks
- Concrete(good building block, could be used outside the ship)
- Wool(useful inside the ship, but be careful using it nearfireorlava, as it is flammable)
- Planks(can be used inside the ship, but it is also flammable, so make sure that fire cannot spread to it)
- Carpets(decorationblock, also usable inside the ship, but again, it is flammable)
- Torches orglowstone(useful for lighting)
- Glass paneorglass(can be used as windows)

## Passenger ferries
Passenger ferries can be built in water bodies between two land masses, where the distance between the masses is not small but not significantly large either (e.g., a large lake, but not a river or an ocean). The size of a passenger ferry varies, such as a steamboat. The boat advised to create depends upon the number of passengers expected and/or the distance between the two lands.

## River cruises
If a huge cruise ship is not what you're looking for, you can build a river cruise boat, which is a smaller ship designed for traveling through rivers. These boats are usually two decks or lower and not very long either. You could build this on top of a naturally generated river, or you could dig your own river and build your boat on that.

## Terminals
Strongly recommended while building a cruise ship, it can include a check in desk, toilets, playing area, café, walkway to the ship, and optionally staircases and/or lifts with more than two levels.

### Recommended building materials
- Cobblestone
- Doors(iron doors may give a more modern look, but need power)
- Glass(for windows; glass panes tend to give more depth)
- Fences
- Stairsand/orSlabs.
- Planks(ensure to keep any wood-based blocks away from fire hazards)
- Wool(again, avoid fires)
- Piston(if creating a sliding, raising or extending terminal)
- Slime Block(if creating a sliding, raising or extending terminal)
- Honey Block(if creating a sliding, raising or extending terminal)
- Lever(if creating a sliding, raising or extending terminal)
- Redstone Dust(if using an iron door or creating a sliding / raising / extending terminal)
- Redstone Repeater(for redstone line extension)

## Terminal tutorials
### 
Create a platform of planks, add fences from floor of water body to platform corners.

### 
Create 2 docks separated the exact width of the boat, create a staircase, extending terminal or sliding terminal up to ship entrance. Optional: Create a customer review booth.

### Low door and platform.
make a door level to a dock or station

### Staircase.
Make a staircase 

### Extending terminal.
place an double piston extender.

attach a slime block line

place a line of a move-able block on front and top of slime block line.

power using a lever.

extend circuit if needed using Repeater

### Sliding terminal.
place an double piston extender.

attach a slime block to the available piston.

create a staircase starting on top of the slime block.

place 1 slime block underneath each stair.

power using lever.

extend circuit if needed using Repeater.

## Life boats
The interior of a player-made lifeboat
All ships have lifeboats. Depending on the size of the vessel, you may have many or only a few lifeboats.
Real-life lifeboats are colored orange, so they could be easily spotted by rescue crews, so you should use orange material to build the lifeboats.

## Things to have onboard
- Cabinsfor persons to live on the cruise ship. You may have different classes for cabins, ranging from ones with nothing but a bunk bed to suites with balconies and king-size beds. More expensive cabins tend to be placed on upper decks.
- Ice Hockeyon large cruise ships
- Spleefarenas
- Nightclubs
- Casino
- Restaurants
- Shops (taxfree or so): A cruise ship doubles as a mall, as it has so many different shops. Make sure to have many shops for exotic and luxury goods.
- Playrooms
- Smoking rooms
- Soda vending machines
- Jukeboxesto play music (remember to put amusic discinside the jukebox or the jukebox won't play any music)
- Info desk
- Swimming pools
- Waterslide
- Engine Room: A ship cannot function without an engine. Engine rooms are huge, with tons of complex machinery. Building an engine room may be tricky, as many have never seen one.
- Car Deck
- Bridge: Any ship needs some form of a command. Build a glorious, wide bridge from which the Captain can lead the vessel.
