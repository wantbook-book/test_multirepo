## 
At a ticket booth, have a person behind a glass screen with a 1×1 hole, with the stated price and destination above the hole. For a ticket turnstile, have a series of iron doors separated by walls with holes in the bottom. Below the holes, have pits that open out into a room. Below each pit, have a wooden pressure plate connected to the door (preferably under) with a person standing next to it to collect the ticket. The ticket can be anything. 
Another idea is to have a separate room with redstone connecting the iron door in the waiting room. In the staff room, there can be a lever that opens the door when pressed. Finally, have controlled water flowing through a 1 block high gap which flows into the staff room (be careful of redstone.) Now, patrons can drop "tickets" into the water and when it reaches the staff, they can open the door.

A new idea is a machine reading your ticket. Have a hole, then a water shaft. 2 blocks in, put hopper and a dropper below that. And put some space further on. Put a redstone comparator next to the hopper above the dropper. Then, put 64×9 of your "money" in the dropper. Put 22 "coins" in the hopper. Then, put two redstone next to it and a redstone repeater after that. Wire this up to an AND gate and a redstone clock. Wire this up to the dropper and another wire to a dropper, which has all your tickets in.

When you put your money in it goes inside the hopper. This makes the comparator go one more block which powers the rest of circuit. You need an AND gate and a clock to make a pulse. The pulse makes the dropper lose one thing so it reverts to its one block. This makes it resettable. It powers the dropper to give you a ticket. If you have any wrong ones, it does not go in the hopper and disappears after a while. Make the money from the first dropper go into lava or into a hopper chain to a chest.
This is quite advanced so only attempt if good with redstone.

### Profits
If well made, ticket fees yield a considerable profit on multiplayer, possibly giving you enough resources to build a massive subway network similar to the New York City Subway, taking vast amounts of people to various places.

It is also possible to do a huge rail network with smaller,  stops. Instead of using up many pickaxes while making stations, a simple single-cart network can be used.

Remember, building a structure this large requires significant time and effort, not to mention the resources. When building an underground network, you may find that sealing off ravines and caves becomes an additional problem. It is therefore wise to start building once you have gotten experience with redstone circuits.

### Hopper Ticket System
Using hoppers, all the tickets (or other fees) thrown into the ticket machine could be pushed with a piston into a hopper on top of a chest, giving the owner the tickets back (or extra money, even)!

## Enhancements
If your train station gets really big, you can add some of the following features:

- Mapsinitem frames. This can show people where they are going.
- Shops. A small trading station where you can buy and sell things from a server user. You could also add more shops that usevillagersfor trading purposes.
- A mini restaurant. The meals could be cooked meat and the drinks could bepotions.
- A goods station. You could use this to send storage carts to your friends.
- Someender chestsfor secure transport of goods, even though this cannot be used to send items to others.
- Aclockin anitem frame.
- For some added fun makemobsoccasionally fall to their deaths, giving free items.

## Platform screen doors
Platform screen doors screen the platform from minecarts. They are found in rapid transit systems like the WolvHaven Metro made by Silver Wolv and the New WolvHaven Blocky Electric Rapid Transit (BERT) made by Axton, the Kasukano Train Railway built by members of Watersuno, and the Nazca Railway built by Nazca Wilde.

### Tutorial
#### WolvHaven Metro
##### 
1. Place 3sticky pistons1 block aside from the opening
2. Place a block next to the middle sticky piston withredstonedust
3. Place aredstone torchunder the block with the redstone dust
4. Place another redstone torch under the block with the other redstone torch
5. Place a block diagonal right to the bottom redstone torch, and put another redstone torch aside the block, that on its side is the torch tower
6. Mirror the same redstone from Step 1 on the right, and skip Step 5
7. Place redstone from the torch aside the block, and carry it to the other side to the bottom of the other torch tower
8. Place aredstone repeatertoward the left of the bottom block of the right torch tower, it should be next to the redstone from the torch diagonal to the bottom of the torch tower
9. Replace the redstone dust with a redstone repeater facing the left torch tower
10. Place adetector railabove the redstone diagonal to the right torch tower

##### Type 2
1. Do the same mechanism from Step 1 until Step 5 from Type 1
2. Place 3 pieces ofredstonedust, one on the block diagonal to the torch tower on both sides
3. Place adropperfacing across 2 blocks right, and 1 block down from the redstone from the diagonal block
4. Place another dropper facing down toward the dropper facing across
5. Place a final dropper facing up in front of the across dropper
6. Place a hopper facing the dropper facing down, and place any item inside the dropper facing across. This creates a quietT-Flip Flop
7. Place 2 blocks in front of the downward facing dropper, and place aredstone comparatoroutput from that dropper
8. Place redstone dust in front of the comparator, and place another block right from the block with the redstone
9. Place aredstone repeaterat the right side from that redstone from the comparator
10. Link the torch towers with redstone dust coming from the repeater
