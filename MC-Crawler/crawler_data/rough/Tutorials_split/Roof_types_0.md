# Tutorials/Roof types
This tutorial lists many common roof types, roughly in ascending order of complexity, and gives examples of each one.

Wikipedia provides additional information and diagrams here, and from that page there are links to other articles with lots more reference images.

Please note that roof terminology is not rigidly defined. Usages vary from place to place, and from one architect or builder to another. One person may describe the alternative mansard roof design shown on these pages as a 'bonnet roof', for example, and this is understandable given the similarities between the two roof shapes.

Roof designs also vary, so that there may be no discernible difference between a 'hipped roof with a gable end' and a 'link dormer', or between one person's 'skillion roof' and another's 'shed roof'. Every element of every roof type may be adjusted, and most roof types can be combined in different ways, producing unlimited numbers of local variants.

## Common roof designs
### Flat roof
Blacksmith's building from a pre-Village and Pillage Update plains village.
This roof type may also be referred to as a parapet roof, meaning a roof with a parapet (a low protective wall) around it.

Making a flat roof is trivial, but making a flat roof that looks real takes a little more effort. Take a leaf from the blacksmith's book from the village and add a border; that little extra effort greatly helps make this simple structure look more attractive. 

Always try to use different block types for a roof border. Use slabs, as in the illustration, or backwards stairs, forming a gutter, or add a border of blank signs all the way round the building, or a parapet, thus making the roof area safe to use. The only thing you shouldn't do is to just use the same materials as for the rest of the building. 

These roofs have one flaw: They are generally a good place for mobs to spawn at night if not lit up or covered in slabs, buttons, or pressure plates.



### Terrace
A partly covered terrace.
If the design of a house offers easy access to an area of a flat roof, that roof area may be paved so that it is useful as an outdoor living area. Terraces may be large or small, covered or open, or a mixture of the two.

A balcony may be very similar to some terrace designs, but it is not part of a roof, and the balcony may or may not have a roof covering over it; as a rule of thumb, the area under a balcony will also be outdoors, whereas the area under a terrace tends to be indoors.


### Shed roof
A shed roof.
A shed or sloped roof is sloped in one direction only. This design is rarely used as the main roof on inhabited buildings, although it may be seen on part of such a building. If it is a building's sole roof it is more likely to be found on cheap, simple or utilitarian buildings such as sheds, animal houses, outhouses or storage barns.  




### Gable roof
Simple gable roof design, not suitable for buildings with widths greater than about 12 blocks.
A gable roof, also known as a pitched or peaked roof, is an inverted 'V'. This roof design is common in the original villages produced by Minecraft's terrain generator, and is useful for small buildings. The building in the image is 6×10 meters. Allowing for the very thick walls one gets in Minecraft that give a usable internal space of 4×8 meters; sufficient for one or two rooms. A building of this size integrates well with village buildings.




### Saltbox roof
A saltbox roof.
Alternative saltbox roof.
A saltbox roof is a type of gable roof where one slope is much longer than the other. Buildings with this roof type quite often have two stories at the front and one at the back; adding a lean-to back roof to an existing structure in this manner is a simple way to extend a building. The front and back slopes of a saltbox roof may have the same pitch, but as the second picture shows this is not always the case. 




### Clerestory roof
A clerestory or half-monitor roof.
A clerestory window is a window too high to see out of which lets light in to a building. Hence clerestory roof is a generic term referring to a roof shaped to include clerestory windows. This roof shape may also be referred to as a half-monitor roof.
