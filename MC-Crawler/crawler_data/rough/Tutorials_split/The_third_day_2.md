## Bees
If you see a bee nest, don't break it or the bees will get mad at you. Instead, put a campfire under it. Wait until the nest is full of honey (they'll be honey in the nest's holes and dripping honey particles underneath) and then shear the nest for 3 honeycombs. Craft a beehive and place it near your base, with a campfire beneath. Plant some flowers near the hive. Go back to the bee nest and use a flower or lead to bring at least 2 bees back to the beehive. Breed them for more. Don't forget to make more hives for the bees to live in as each hive can only hold 3 bees. You can now get honey bottles. These can remove poison, which is useful for exploring mineshafts and oceans, and when fighting witches. Bees can also pollinate crops to make them gow faster, so have the hives near the farm. Bee nests also sometimes spawn when growing oak or birch trees, if a flower is nearby.

## Expansions to the Shelter
On your first night, players must have a shelter before the sun goes down, otherwise build strong tools in time to combat the enemies relentlessly hunting the player down, or get to a place where the enemies cannot reach the player. Although, no matter what precaution is taken, there is always some strange possibility that a creeper could get inside any shelter and blow everything up. This could open a few opportunities to expand.

A suitable house for the third day. It's made of cobblestone stairs and stone bricks, making it fully fire-resistant and partially blast resistant, and is medium in size.
Although building your shelter out of dirt and wood may seem convenient, easy, and simple, it is not safe, so is certainly not advisable.  As you mine, you will collect both cobblestone, and other stone blocks (andesite, diorite, granite).  All of these are much stronger than dirt or wood -- once you have enough completely rebuild any above-ground parts of your shelter.  You may want to craft the "other stone" blocks into their polished or carved versions, for looks; once you have plenty of fuel, you can also smelt cobblestone back into gray stone and make stone bricks.  This is mostly to improve resistance to creepers.  Adding glass windows to the home will allow you to look outside of the shelter and identify dangers, especially creepers, so you are not surprised by enemies.  If you are in Hard difficulty, zombies can break down doors, in other difficulties they will still bang on the doors but cannot break them.   You can also surround your house with a fence, using fence gates so you can get in and out.   Placing torches every 7-10 blocks along the fence, and around your house, will prevent enemies from spawning inside your perimeter.  As you continue playing, you can expand your perimeter and light up more territory.

Overworld (the world you spawn in) hostile mobs do not climb ladders so you can use height to your advantage. Also remember to avoid looking at endermen (which means placing your cross hairs on it). This will cause the enderman to turn hostile for a short while.

Consider building a safe room, which is a simple room underground with a bed, a chest full of food, a bow and arrows (and/or a sword, if you have no bow or arrows), and a door opening. This is so that you can sleep through the night, minimize monsters, bring your health back up, and kill off the monsters keeping you in.

### Expanding Your Shelter
The first thing to do is check the time of day. If you're planning on lots of work, make sure it's morning. A good idea is to renovate. This is because unless your base is underground, hostile mobs may spawn and attack you. Expanding requires you to expose yourself to the outside.

Choose a good technique for your extension. A good idea for your early days in Minecraft is cobblestone. "Stone" blocks (cobblestone, stone, granite, etc.) have higher blast resistance than dirt/planks, and cobblestone is the easiest to get in large quantities. It'll be hard for a creeper to do serious damage to a cobblestone shelter, but for a planks/dirt shelter, a large part or all may be blown up. Any form of shelter should be as strong as possible.

An alternative would be to dig your base deeper, possibly collecting ores you may come across along the way.

Many players also choose to start a mine from inside their shelter (that is, start the initial shaft or stair from a convenient indoor spot). This will allow you to mine through the night without danger of mobs coming in. (If it's a stairway, you'll want a fence gate at the entrance.)
