### Cactus
Creating a ditch filled with cacti at the bottom can be deadly, as the cacti will deal damage and the rugged terrain will severely hinder any mobs that attempt to cross the ditch. A well-crafted cactus ditch can also double as a cactus farm or a cactus wall when the cacti grow.

### TNT
TNT is a very effective way to kill mobs. Try making a field system in where blocks of TNT pop-up to deal area damage to only mobs. However, TNT is rather expensive to make, as although gunpowder is renewable, the only way to make sand renewable is to buy some from wandering trader, so when making this, it's recommended to have a desert or beach nearby. However, one disadvantage is that TNT can quickly ruin the landscape unless it is exploded in water.

### Mob Navigation Trick
Instead of a door, a useful trick is to make a 3 block high entrance, then cover the top and the bottom with any sort of slab. The mob's navigation system tells them that they cannot go through the opening. Beware though, as skeletons can still shoot you and creepers can still explode. Planting vines in front of the entrance will cut their vision. Bamboo can also do the same thing as slabs, while skeletons can still shoot through.

#### Light
Light, in the form of evenly dispersed source blocks, should not be underestimated. Even without any physical defensive measures, a wide ring of torches prevents most hostile mobs from spawning. Additionally, if the area is large enough, their random wanderings will not bring them within attack range of the player.

Torches are by far the most commonly used light source for this purpose. Moats of lava, glowstone, jack o'lanterns, sea lantern and lantern can also be used, though the scarcity of glowstone and sea lantern in singleplayer is a limiting factor, and pumpkins, which are used to make jack-o-lanterns, are rather hard to find. Lava is sometimes problematic to use because it ignites flammable materials that are within four blocks.

#### Soul sand
A ring of soul sand can be a highly effective delaying mechanism, useful for keeping mobs within range of an active defense or just away from a structure. Keep in mind that a player could use the soul speed enchantment on their boots to go a lot faster. A strip three blocks wide is the minimum for an effective delayer.

Soul sand also makes an excellent bottom for a ditch, although it is worth noting that soul sand also prevents zombies and skeletons from burning.

#### Waterfall
A water gateway.
Waterfalls are an effective way to protect your doorway as a last line of defense. By using an overhang, a player can run a waterfall down and over the entrance to their home. A one block deep ditch as wide as the waterfall will prevent the water from flowing in unwanted directions. If a creeper, skeleton, or zombie walks into the waterfall, they will be pushed down into the ditch, effectively stopping them. Though the ditch can be made deeper, it is inadvisable since the player may accidentally fall into the ditch themselves. The downward pressure of the waterfall will cause the player to swim upwards much more slowly than usual, so one block deep is recommended. To enter their home, a player must jump into the waterfall and keep moving forward. This will deposit the player safely on the other side of the waterfall.

#### Covered Hole

A carpet on top of a string will be invisible to mobs; therefore, mining a hole deep enough to cause damage when you fall through and placing the carpet over it will stop mobs from pathfinding over. This is useful for mapmakers who want a hidden way to keep mobs from reaching certain areas.

### Combination Defenses
Like historical defensive formations, the most secure perimeters are based around multiple concentric systems used in synergistic combination. A classic example is a moat surrounding a walled compound: creatures which might reach and breach the wall (e.g., endermen) are delayed or killed before they can reach the wall by the moat (water or lava). Any and all of the aforementioned passive defensive measures can be used to make an area secure; the only limit is the amount of time the player is willing to put into it at the expense of other goals and the amount of space and time available.

## Shelter Defenses
Every shelter needs good defenses, and here are some tips to avoid trouble.

### Explosion resistant houses
Explosion resistant houses are fairly easy to build, and aren't extremely expensive. Use the Materials section above to assist you in choosing explosive resistant materials.

### Tips
You should have many windows, so as to be aware of any mobs around. Make sure to light your house and surrounding area well. It is suggested to have an automatic door and protect the surrounding area with a minefield, trap(s), or some sort of defense.

Try making multiple panic rooms or bunkers, preferably for different situations (i.e. creeper in front of your house, skeleton stalking you etc.). Another good idea is to make an emergency exit- this is a deep hole with water at the bottom and some supplies; only use this in an emergency.

Another idea is make a way to get behind, under, or above a hostile mob around your house. This could include a tunnel, a water slide or even a roller coaster. However, this can be rather difficult to make.

Try putting a dispenser filled with arrows in front of your door(s). This way, if there are dangerous mobs in front of your house, you can just press a button and activate the dispenser. You could also use sticky pistons and other blocks to block the entrance. However, this requires you to stay inside or make a second exit.

### Security
This can come in handy if you have some security systems up. Here are some ideas:

An alarm can be very useful for security. Here's what you will need to make one:

- At least 1pressure plate
- Lots ofredstone(Depends on how far away you want the alarm)
- At least 1note block

Place pressure plates around an area you would like to protect, or your entrance(s); try to keep them separated as much as possible (optional). Then, attach the note block(s) to the pressure plates with redstone wire. From now on, whenever a mob or a player walks on a pressure plate, the note blocks will generate a sound notifying you. If you mine often, put a note block(s) in your mine or along a rail road.

• A self-destruct system might be useful, to prevent others in multiplayer from stealing your belongings. For this to work, the TNT has to be concealed in a wall, and there should be redstone (that is concealed) attached to a button to activate the TNT. It is also recommended that you have a blast-proof room where you store or hide in before you activate the self-destruct. The button should also be in this room.

• If you have a lot of iron ingots and pumpkins, then you can make the perfect defense. Iron golems have 50 hearts and can kill most mobs in 1-2 hits. Make sure to keep them near your house though; as they may wander away. To prevent this, put the iron golems inside of a trench surrounding your house. The trench should be 2 wide and at least 4 deep, otherwise the golems will fling mobs back out of the trench. An alternative is to leash them to a fence using leads.

You could try dispensers to defend your home entrance, but you would need a lot of arrows. Another idea is to push the mob or player in a moat to it a pressure plate, activating a dispenser. It works better with multiple dispensers, all with redstone repeater.

Finally, you could use fireworks as flares. These can be used when you have a large perimeter wall and a few of your friends as sentries. The sentries can raise the alarm by firing the fireworks. You can also attach the fireworks to redstone circuits. However, note that fireworks are expensive to acquire.
