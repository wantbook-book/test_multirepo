### Java Edition launcher
Some launcher Easter eggs. The shrugging emoticon has been clicked, causing it to turn white. A witch has also appeared after the player hovered over the play button.
Before the release of the Java Edition launcher version 2.1.497x, the launcher contained multiple Easter eggs. If the player hovered their cursor over the "Play" button for a few seconds, a random mob would appear in the bottom right corner of the launcher. In the top left corner of the launcher, the player could see a translucent creeper face. There was about a 1⁄11 chance of the creeper face being replaced with a shrugging emoticon, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. When the player clicked on either of these, they turned solid white. Clicking them again would return them to their translucent state. In addition, if the player pressed ctrl+b, the experience orb pickup sound plays. These can no longer work because the launcher has since been updated.

In the old Legacy Console Edition TU12-TU13 Tutorial World, on the top floor of the sandstone pyramid, there are four blocks of gold on top of a block of obsidian. This is the "Tower of Pimps". It was created by Gavin Free of Achievement Hunter in their video "Let's Play Minecraft Part 2 - On a Rail!" and has become a symbol of the group's Let's Play Minecraft series, mainly as a trophy of their competitions in their Achievement City world within Xbox 360 Edition and Java Edition.[9]

### Stampylonghead reference
In the Legacy Console Edition TU19/CU7/1.12 Tutorial World, there was an island in the northeast side of the world and it had a remake of Stampy's house along with his boat, the S.S. Stumpy.[10]

Additionally, the boat was seen in the trailer for Legacy Console Edition TU19/CU7.[11]

### 
Notch's birthday splash text in early alpha.
Notch's birthday splash text in 1.7.9.
On June 1, Notch's birthday, the only splash displayed is "Happy Birthday, Notch!" 

This splash was removed in Java Edition 1.8.5, since Notch no longer works for Mojang.

#### 
When Notch died in-game, he dropped an additional apple along with his inventory. At a certain time in-game, these were unobtainable.[12] This no longer occurs.[13][14]

## References to other franchises
### Portal
The achievement for crafting a cake is called "The Lie", likely in reference to the phrase "The cake is a lie" from the popular Valve game Portal.

### Super Mario
Elytra's behavior, Tommaso tweets, "is like Mario 64" in reference to the Wing Cap from Super Mario 64.

One of the paintings is a reference to the Donkey Kong arcade game.[15]

### The Shining
If a vindicator is named "Johnny", it behaves like a zoglin, attacking every mob except agents, ghasts, illagers and themselves. This references the scene "Here's Johnny" from the movie The Shining.[16]

### Star Fox
The achievement for using a trident enchanted with Riptide is called "Do a Barrel Roll!" in reference to the popular phrase said by Peppy Hare in Star Fox 64 and Star Fox Zero, telling the player to execute an aerial maneuver called a barrel roll.

### 2001: A Space Odyssey
Before 1.13, using /help in a command block displays one of a few joke messages, one of which is "Oh my god, it's full of stats", a reference to a quote from the novel 2001: A Space Odyssey. In the witty comments of a crash report, there are two other quotes, "I'm sorry, Dave." and "Quite honestly, I wouldn't worry myself about that."

### Age of Empires
If an evoker sees a blue sheep, it turns the sheep into a red sheep while uttering "wololo". This is a reference to the Priest unit from the Age of Empires real-time strategy game series, which would utter "wololo" while converting enemy units to their side, changing their color. The evoker specifically uses the sound sample from the 1999 title Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings.[17][18]

### Terraria
The summoning mechanism for the wither boss, according to Jens, was inspired by the summoning mechanisms for bosses in Terraria. The game is also directly referenced in a splash text, "Also try Terraria!".

### Counter Strike 1.6
Three of the paintings in the game are of stages in Counter Strike 1.6, de_aztec 1 & 2 and Target successfully bombed.

### Grim Fandango
The painting 'Mortal Coil' is a reference to the character Bruno Martinez from Grim Fandango

### Project Zomboid
One of the games splash texts recommends the game Project Zomboid. "Also try Project Zomboid!"

### 
The "missingno" data tag on an iron pickaxe
In Java Edition, using commands to obtain an item that can mine a non-existent block ID (any block ID that is not in the game), sets the text to simply display "missingno", likely a reference to the famous glitched pokémon MissingNo. in the Pokémon Red and Blue video games.[more information needed]

The translation key in Bedrock Edition for invalid structures is feature.missingno, in reference to the same glitch.

### Quake
The "Quake Pro" FOV option is likely a reference to the Quake series of first-person shooter games, specifically the fact that pro players often use an extremely high FOV to see as much around them as possible.
