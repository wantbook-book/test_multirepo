## Finding a zombie villager
Zombie villagers spawn in place of a normal zombie 5% of the time and can also be found in igloo basements and zombie villages. Manually scouting your base's perimeter during the night is a good way to find zombie villagers.

If you cannot find a zombie villager, you can summon them via commands or use a spawn egg if you have cheats on.

In Bedrock Edition zombie villagers have the same 5% chance to emerge from a zombie spawner as they have of spawning naturally on the Overworld surface. This makes zombie villager farming possible.

## Curing a zombie villager
1. Prepare before the curing process by taking off yourThornsenchanted armor (if your armor isn't enchanted with Thorns don't worry about that) and put away anything that might hurt the zombie villager, such as splash healing potions. Try to keep your golden apples next to your splash/lingering weakness potions or your bow if you're using weakness arrows, since you might forget your golden apples and the zombie villager loses the weakness effect by the time you find the apple. Grab a shield with a durability above half so you can block the attacks more safely. If you're planning to use weakness arrows, use an unenchanted bow since enchanted bows mostly deal more damage to the zombie villager. Make your tamed wolves sit and move youriron golemsaway from the zombie villager. Make sure you don't heal the zombie villager in the middle of araidbecause the raidingillagersmight attack the newly-cured villager. Try to keep your health above half because the zombie villager might kill you if you have too little health. Now after the preparing is complete and you had turned off most of your defenses, go find a zombie villager in any of the places stated above.
2. When you find a zombie villager, lure the zombie villager and secure it in a safe area that no hostile mobs can break into (make it following you it is best, and try to use a door to secure it), in case a zombie kills or infects the newly-cured villager, making you lose your hard work and patience. Make sure to include a roof of opaque blocks so the zombie villager does not burn when the night ends. Also, it's best not to heal multiple zombie villagers at a time (unless you can feed all of them a golden apple around the same time, or if they're sealed in separate areas) because if one zombie villager is healed, other zombie villagers attack that villager and turn it back into a zombie villager.
3. Select theSplash Potion of Weakness, use your bow if you are using anArrow of Weakness(don't enchant your bow withPowerorFlameor else it might kill the zombie villager), or lure awitchclose to the zombie villager or vice versa. Don't worry about the zombie villager attacking the witch after the witch threw the weakness potion because the witch's potions (except weakness and slowness) do nothing to the zombie villager (poison does nothing to the zombie villager because the zombie villager is immune to poison and harming heals the zombie villager since it's an undead mob).
4. Throw the splash/lingering potion or shoot the tipped arrow at the zombie villager from a distance. Or stand within 3 blocks of the witch and the zombie villager until the witch throws a splash potion of weakness. If done correctly, the zombie villager should have gray swirls emanating from it; this means that the zombie villager is currently inflicted withweakness, which, as it is an undead mob, gives it lives (giving "live energy" so to say, the first part of the cure).
5. Feed the zombie villager thegolden apple, done by facing the zombie villager and pressing theusekey. If done correctly, the zombie villager emits red particles and starts shaking. Note that iron bars and beds speed up the curing process. Keep the zombie villager safe at this point and don't attack it.
6. After 3 to 5 minutes have elapsed, the zombie villager converts into a normal villager. If you found your zombie villager in an igloo basement or a zombie village, you have to transport them, likely viaboats,minecarts, upwardbubble columns(soul sand and water),nether portals, or other ways of manual movement, as villagers cannot be leashed unlike other mobs. You can also push the villager onto the ladder to make it climb up. Make sure you bring the villager's job site blocks if you're in an igloo!

Curing a zombie villager grants you the Zombie Doctor achievement/advancement if it has not been obtained yet. If the cured villager has a profession, it permanently provides heavy discounts while trading to the player that cured them.â€Œ[Java Edition  only] There is also a heavy discount on Bedrock Edition with 1.16, another thing to keep in mind is that in Bedrock Edition, the discount spreads through the "talking" of villagers 16 blocks in a cube from the cured Villager.
