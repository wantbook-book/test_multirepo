### Oak tree farming





A space-efficient fully automatic oak tree farm. A TNT Duplicator is used for automation.


Since the player can only harvest 7 blocks above the ground without climbing on something, the most efficient tree farm design limits the height of trees to 9 blocks. This allows 7 blocks of logs as a "trunk" and 2 block of leaves above that. This is accomplished by adding a ceiling at 10th block above the ground, leaving a space 9 blocks high in which trees can grow. This allows all of the wood from the trees to be harvested quickly and with minimal effort. The other option is to grab what you can from the ground and use a flint and steel to burn what you can't reach.

It should be noted that leaving 9 blocks of space for trees to grow does not guarantee that all trees grow to this height. Trees grow with trunks 4-7 blocks in height, but not higher. Some may also grow branches despite the height limitation.

This height issue can also be avoided by planting a sapling on the bottom of a 2-block-deep hole. This ensures that the top layer of the tree remains reachable, and has the added benefit of preventing mobs from hiding in the shadow of the tree and surviving daylight. It also prevents growth of the smallest size, whose leaves would be blocked by the hole.

Note that oaks can grow through certain blocks: Small oaks can replace many blocks (fences, glass (but not glass panes), paintings, stairs, pistons, torches, buttons, ladders and doors), while the branch wood of large oaks can grow through even solid blocks (including bedrock).

Because trees grow underground with a nearby light source, and also grow when in direct or diagonal contact with other trees, quite compact arrangements can be used for efficient use of space.

Underground saplings rely on torch light to grow. Various patterns of saplings and torches can be used to achieve varying degrees of space efficiency. Since saplings only require light level 9 to grow, a single torch starting at light level 14 can sufficiently light 60 saplings. However, this torch-efficient model comes at the cost of stability. Trees can grow and block the torch light to other saplings. Underground tree farms should stay clear of magma blocks because a bug relating to the south-east rule may let magma affect any leaf/wood blocks occupying the same corner.[verify]

#### Space-efficient farming
It is also possible to grow trees to maximize wood for the territory. However, because the canopies overlap, you harvest fewer saplings. Oak, birch, jungle, and acacia trees ignore logs of their own kind when calculating when to grow. However, spruce trees still require two blocks between other trees.

A space-efficient oak tree farm.
The most space-efficient way to prevent grown trees from blocking light to other saplings is to have every sapling
directly next to a torch (not diagonal). This strategy yields a basic space efficiency of 80% since the pattern is made up of units of 1 torch + 4 saplings. The plus-sign shaped units can be arranged to completely fill an area.

It is recommended that the perimeter walkway and all blocks with a torch underneath be a different material, such as cobblestone. This allows for quick visual identification during re-planting, of which blocks get saplings and which get torches that may have been inadvertently knocked out during harvest. It is recommended to do the same for torches on the wall, as these may get knocked off by growing trees. If you dig down two blocks instead, and place the torches under glass blocks, the trees still receive the proper light level, and you are far less likely to inadvertently break your light structure during harvesting or replanting.

This design takes account for the fact that all saplings adjacent to the walkway are supplied by light from the torches on the walkway. Thus the farm yields an efficiency of 84%.

Note when the tree farm is cut down, the amount of returned saplings per tree is much lower than cutting trees in a forest, as the canopy is shared by many trees. Using an iron Hoe with Fortune III to break the leaves will, on average, drop enough saplings to replant the farm.

### Farming spruce and birch
Farming spruce trees in an efficient way.
Unlike oak trees, spruce and birch trees never grow to a branched tree. This makes them easier to harvest, but to farm Birch and Spruce trees efficiently, more space is required.
Birches can be planted next to other birches with 2 blocks of space between them since the birch leaves can overlap with other birch leaves. This same spacing holds true for spruces. However, when planting the different types of trees together, birch and spruce trees need 4 blocks of space in between the saplings (the tree does not grow if leaves of a different tree are obstructing its path). Both birch and spruce trees require 9 blocks of vertical space above the sapling to grow regularly (10 is more efficient for growth). Both spruce and birch grow with less space, but not as regularly. Like other saplings, they must receive light level 8 or better to grow.
