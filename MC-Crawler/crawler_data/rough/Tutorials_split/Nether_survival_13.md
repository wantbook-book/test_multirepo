### Disabling mining spawns
Most people mine by having a main "hub" tunnel, and having a lot of seperate tunnels that go off of that.

You do not want to have your mines where you are farming mobs. More spawn in your mines and less spawn where you are farming. To prevent this, know where your main hub mining system is in proportion to your base. You need to make sure all of your biomes where you are farming things are outside of your mines. For example, if your base is at X point, and all of your biomes where you farm mobs are south of your base, then your mining tunnels must go north in proportion to your base. That means that your main hub mining tunnel must go between east and west, with the seperate mining tunnels going north, in that specific example.

## Farming
### Bone meal farming
A bone meal farm is essential to obtaining mushroom stew through a mushroom farm, and farming trees and fungi. Most vegetation items in the Nether can be composted in a composter, including nether wart, shroomlights, nether wart blocks, warped wart blocks, weeping vines, twisting vines, warped roots, crimson roots, nether sprouts, crimson fungi, and warped fungi. However, weeping vines and twisting vines are arguably the easiest to grow in large quantities because they grow to a maximum length of 25 blocks, and the twisting vines specifically grow up from the ground like sugar cane or bamboo which makes it simple to harvest. Twisting vines and weeping vines can therefore both be farmed in a manner similar to sugarcane, with the whole plant growing from one single source block.


Farming these vines is quite simple. For twisting vines, plant them on any solid block on the ground. After it has grown tall enough that you'd like to harvest it you can break the second block off the ground, to destroy the entire stem but leave the one from which the plant is growing and avoid having to replant them. Weeping vines can be a bit more challenging to farm because they grow down instead of up. But, ideally you plant them on the ceiling and make a platform to reach them and collect your harvest (again, using the second block from the source block from which the whole plant is growing), and then the plants fall onto the ground. You can then use the items on a composter to create bone meal. When farming either one of these be sure to allow your plants plenty of space to grow.

### Vegetation farming
Vegetation farming is essential to tree farms, hoglin farms, and strider farms. When you bone meal nylium of any type, it generates vegetation on that nylium block and surrounding nylium blocks. The vegetation includes fungi of both types, roots of both types, and nether sprouts. Certain types of nylium generate more of their color type of vegetation, for example crimson nylium generates mostly crimson fungi and roots, but can generate warped vegetation. The only thing you need to obtain from these farms is warped and nylium fungus, used for breeding animals and growing trees. All other items are used only as decoration. There is no setup for this, but make sure you are doing it on the maximum amount of nylium possible so that there is space for it to generate. If your area of nylium is not wide enough, you can spread it by putting bone meal on netherrack adjacent to nylium. You can also obtain nylium in the warped forest, where endermen are often found holding it

### Tree farming
When a fungi is placed on its corresponding nylium and then fertilized with bone meal, it can turn into a huge fungi. Warped (blue) fungi can turn only into a huge warped fungi if placed on warped nylium (blue nylium), and vice versa with crimson. There is no special setup, but you need to destroy the nether wart blocks (fastest with a hoe), because it needs space to be able to generate a huge fungi. Also, after it grows into a huge fungus, the nylium below it decays into netherrack, and you need to apply bone meal to it, which turns it back into nylium if there is adjacent nylium next to the netherrack.

### Mushroom farming
Mushroom stew is the easiest food to farm. When bone meal is applied to a mushroom placed on any nylium, it can grow into a huge mushroom. They can be placed on nylium only to be fertilized, and unlike other blocks like dirt, they do not require a low light level to grow. Setup:

- They need space to grow.
- After it is grown into a huge mushroom, the nylium below it decays into netherrack, so you need to put bone meal on it, which turns the netherrack back into nylium if there is nylium adjacent to it.
- The blocks are fastest broken with an axe. They can be hard to reach from the ground, so you can build stairs up to a platform that lets you jump on top of the mushroom.

After the establishing food and wood farms, you can begin the next stage of progression. Next, you need to explore. Exploring is the most essential part to the next step of your progression. While exploring, you need to 

1. Find a nether fortress. You can find 1-3 diamonds as loot for a 19% chance in both Java and Bedrock, You can also find other loot including saddles, and golden armor, golden swords, golden and iron horse armor. The armor you can wear to be protected against piglins. You can also smelt it into gold nuggets, and you can smelt the iron horse armor into iron nuggets too. You want to also find nether wart, and in the future, blaze rods
2. Mine a lot of nether gold ore. Since this can be found through the Nether, it is definitely worth it to get all of the gold that you can, since it is valuable in bartering. Get any in sight.
3. Find a bastion remnant. There are four variants, and each one has different treasure. Bastion Remnants can provide a large amount of gold and various items in treasure, including large quantities of iron, arrows, gold, and even diamonds, diamond armor, or diamond tools, which can be enchanted. This is definitely worth the exploration since it speeds everything up by a lot
4. Find a ruined portal. If you are planning one escaping the Nether, having a nearly finished portal is helpful. The treasure can also be good, including obsidian, gold armor for Piglins, enchanted gold tools, and iron nuggets sometimes. They also have gold blocks near them, which you can't mine with a stone pickaxe.
5. Discover the rest of the biomes. Each biome has helpful things about it, and having access to all of the biomes is extremely helpful.

Next, you want to do bartering with the piglins. Hopefully, you have around two stacks of gold ingots, which can be a grind to get. You can drop a gold ingot near piglins or use it on them. They'll pick it up and drop you a random item. 

You are looking for several items in particular: 

1. Iron. There is a 2.18% chance of piglins giving you 10-36 iron nuggets, which you can craft into ingots. Since you cannot afford the luxury of making iron tools, your first priority would be to make a shield. Next you need to make an iron pickaxe. The reason for this is that gold blocks generate in bastion remnants, and you cannot obtain them with a stone pickaxe. You cannot afford to make any other tools, but if you have enough you can make a hopper. That makes your total iron to explore a bastion remnant 9 iron
2. String. Piglins have a 4.36% chance of giving you 3-9 string. Striders drop string as well, dropping 2-5 string, without Looting on a sword. You need string to craft a bow, which you need for taking down a bastion. You also need it to craft wool for beds for Netherite mining, however that is late-game.
3. Spectral arrows (Java Editiononly). Piglins have an 8.71% chance of giving you 6-12 spectral arrows. These function like normal arrows, and do the same damage, however they give entities the glowing effect for 10 seconds. That causes a white outline to appear around the target that shows up through obstructions, which is effective in bastion remnants
4. Potions of Fire Resistance/splash potions of Fire Resistance. Piglins have a 1.74% chance of giving you a 3:00 Potion of Fire Resistance or a 3:00 Splash Potion of Fire Resistance. These are useful for fighting blazes, and useful for lava and fire if you slip by accident.

That's all you should need for exploring the bastion remnant or the nether fortress. However, you can receive many more good things. Visit the bartering page for more information.
