While pixel art is often colorful, appealing results can be achieved even with a limited palette, as demonstrated by this pixel art portrait of the Pokémon Sandshrew.
Pixel art refers to a player utilizing Minecraft blocks to make certain figures from within the video game or in real life. These pieces of art are usually composed out of colorful blocks, such as wool or concrete, though you could also use other types of blocks to further match the reference or idea with the art that you are constructing. Although pixel art has no real purpose for survival, it may be a fun way to show people what you can build with the blocks that you have access to, or it can just be a hobby you could do to express your artistic talents. 

## Designs in Minecraft
Designs drawn that are copied from Minecraft are usually mobs or blocks, drawn so that a 1 pixel is equal to 1 block. This makes pixel art that copies Minecraft textures around 16 times bigger than the mob or block. To make these even bigger, you can upscale your design by making 1 pixel equal to any square (1:1) ratios bigger than a 1×1 block area, such as 2×2 blocks, 4×4 blocks, etc. 

### Blocks
Blocks can be rather difficult to make with pixel art, because of the fact that some blocks use many different colors for each pixel, but they are all similar. The reason this makes the pixel art difficult is that there may not be enough wool or concrete colors to simulate every pixel. If this happens, you can either try to figure out what colored block simulates each pixel the closest, or use blocks that are not wool, concrete, or terracotta. Blocks that are not these colors usually have many different colors within themselves, but from a distance, it looks equal.

#### Sea lantern
Sea lanterns are arguably one of the easiest blocks to make with pixel art. Therefore, they're a great block to start off with. Simply make the outer edges of each face with cyan wool or concrete. Then, add cyan wool/concrete in the corners of what you just made. For the rest of the next layer inward, use light blue wool/concrete. Once again, add light blue wool/concrete in the corners of what you just made. Finally, fill in the middle of it with white wool/concrete. You are done.

#### Stone
The pixels in stone blocks are different shades of gray. Making a stone block for pixel art should consist of gray wool or concrete, light gray wool or concrete, and stone itself. If you want an even bigger contrast, you can use white concrete for the lightest pixels in a stone block.

#### Obsidian
For the purples in an obsidian block, use a combination of a few of the following blocks: magenta wool or concrete, purple wool or concrete, magenta terracotta, and/or blue terracotta. For the black, use a combination of black terracotta and black wool or concrete. Use black wool or concrete for a more solid black color.

A cake made using pixel art, with its colors being almost identical to what's being described to the right.
#### Cake
Use terracotta and brown wool/concrete for the base of the cake, or the actual "cake" part. For the top of the cake, or the "icing" of the cake, use white wool/concrete. For the specks of red on top, which simulate "strawberries", use red wool or concrete. If 1 pixel is equal to 1 block, the cake should be 8 blocks high, rather than 16 blocks, because a cake is a half-block in height.

#### Pumpkin
For most of the pumpkin, use a combination of at least 3 of the following: orange wool/concrete, brown wool/concrete, orange terracotta, light gray terracotta, and/or white terracotta. For the "face", or front of the pumpkin, use brown terracotta or brown wool/concrete for the lighter parts, and gray terracotta or black terracotta for the darker parts. The "stem", or the center of the top, should be made with green terracotta, yellow terracotta, and yellow wool/concrete.

#### Glowstone
For the dull background of the glowstone, use cyan or green terracotta. For the highlights, use a combination of white wool/concrete, yellow wool/concrete, white terracotta, and yellow terracotta, and surround these highlights with brown wool/concrete and gray terracotta. Do this on each of the 6 sides.

### Mobs
Mobs have varying heights in Minecraft, depending on what mob it is. Like blocks, they can be difficult to create, but generally, mobs have slightly more varying colors than blocks.

#### Zombie
A partially completed pixel art zombie made with concrete and terracotta, with a head and 1 arm missing.
The "feet" of the zombie should be made of gray wool or concrete. The legs should be made up of purple wool/concrete, with blue terracotta to highlight the "knees". The torso of the zombie should be made of light blue wool or concrete, with cyan to highlight certain spots, and the arms should be made of green and lime wool or concrete. Finally, the head of the zombie should be made with lime wool/concrete and green wool/concrete, or if desired, also include green and lime terracotta, and white wool/concrete.
