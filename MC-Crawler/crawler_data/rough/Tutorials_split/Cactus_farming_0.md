# Tutorials/Cactus farming
Cactus farming is the systematic planting and harvesting of cacti. Cactus farms are useful for acquiring green dye by smelting the cactus blocks or for storing experience in a furnace due to its high XP output when smelted, though it does not produce nearly as much XP when smelted in Bedrock Edition. Efficient, productive, and interesting farm configurations can be achieved with the creative placement of water source blocks and sand.

## Manual designs
Manual cactus farms can be a great start to farming cactus. Manual designs are generally cheaper, easier to build, and more lag efficient than automatic designs. However, manual farms are also less efficient and much slower than automatic designs. If you do not need a large amount of cacti, manual farms should be enough.

### Cactus rows
This design is probably the simplest next to looting a desert biome. To build it, simply place cactus in rows 1 space apart from each other. It may be desirable to space rows 2 blocks apart to make harvesting easier without getting pricked. If you are not careful, there may be some loss from the cactus being destroyed.

### Diagonal rows
This method of cactus farming allows for the player to harvest cacti without taking damage. It uses a platform and a water canal to collect the cacti. Wait for the cactus to grow and break the upper block while standing on the pedestal. It is not the most efficient nor compact design, but it could do for smaller farms. It has about a 15% loss rate.

### Piston harvester












































































































Compact piston placement (Bedrock Edition only).
Generally speaking, the use of pistons in a cactus farm is a very laggy and noncompact way of harvesting. However, in a manual design, the use of pistons can be beneficial as they allow the cactus to be more tightly packed and make it easier to harvest without being damaged. Additionally, since all the cactus are broken at once, there is less for broken cactus to be destroyed.

The schematic shows an efficient way of building a farm like this. The redstone and pistons should be built 1 block beneath the sand. Cacti should be placed on every sand block. A block will need to be placed on the pistons or they will not push up high enough to break the cacti. If you are lacking in slime, gravel or another falling block can be used instead of sticky pistons.

Notice how each cactus is only next to 1 piston and each piston except on the edges is next to 4 cacti. When building, make sure it is same if you want to  use the least pistons. The first time you build this, it may be helpful to place the sand and pistons first. You could do this on a level surface, digging an extra block lower for each piston. When you are satisfied that the placement of the pistons is correct, remove the sand and ground where the redstone goes.
