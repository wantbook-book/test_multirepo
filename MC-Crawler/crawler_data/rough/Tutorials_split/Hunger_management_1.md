** Golden apple **
Restore 
Advantages:
- Cause temporary constant health regeneration that is not dependent on the player'shunger.
	- The rate of regeneration is faster than the natural health regeneration inBedrock Editionand beforeJava Edition 1.9, making them useful in combat and emergency situations.
- Compared withpotions of regeneration, their effects are available without the need forbrewing, which is only possible by accessingthe Nether.
	- Not to mention that golden apples are stackable up to 64, but potions are not.
- Tree farmingcan provide a good supply ofapples.Tradingwith farmervillagers can also get them in quantity.
- Can be used to curezombie villagers. Ifgenerated structuresare turned off, this is the only way to obtain villagers and trade with them.
- Although they restore fewer hunger points, they grant 5 seconds ofregenerationII and 2 minutes ofabsorption, giving the player an extra 4.
- Restore 9.6 saturation, a large amount considering their low hunger restoration.
- They can be eaten while the hunger bar is full, which means the player can maintain a high level of saturation (and the natural regeneration it offers) without being only able to eat until the hunger bar starts draining.

Disadvantages:
- Require 8gold ingots to be crafted, meaning that they are too expensive to be an efficient food source inSurvival mode, unless with an efficient gold (zombified piglin) farm
- Eating them takes a few seconds, whilesplash potions orlingering potions of Healing can be instantly applied bythrowingthem.
- Finding them in structures (dungeon,mineshaft,igloo,stronghold,underwater ruins,desert pyramid,woodland mansion,ruined portal,bastion remnant) chests is rare and unreliable.

- Finding the golden carrot itself is also difficult, as they can be found inruined portalandbastion remnantchests.
- Though cheaper than golden apples, they still need gold nuggets to be crafted.

Restores 
Advantages:
- They restore one of the highest amount of hunger and saturation (12.8 points) of any food in the game.

	- Cows, mooshrooms and hoglins also supply the player withleather.
- Hoglins are a source of porkchops inthe Nether.
	- Since hoglins are hostile mobs, theyrespawn quickly, making breeding unnecessary, enabling efficienthoglin farmsto be built.
- Raw beef and porkchops can be cooked quickly using acampfireorsoul campfirewhen away from a reliable source of food.
	- All these mobs can also be killed while on fire to get cooked meat directly.
- Cooked beef ‌[BE  only]and cooked porkchops areoffered by butcher villagersat reasonable prices.

Disadvantages:
- Their availability is dependent on the presence of animals within sight, which can be random and require extensive traveling depending on the biome the player spawns in.
- At least two animals of a type must be found to breed them for a reliable supply of meat.
- Breeding pigs requirescarrots,potatoes orbeetroots, which can be difficult to obtain, if there are novillages with carrot or potato farms nearby, orshipwrecks with supply chests, as they only very rarely drop fromzombies.
- Hoglins are hostile mobs that can cause massive damage, and they can only be hunted and bred inthe Nether, because in otherdimensionstheyzombify.

- Similarly, to beef and pork, at least two sheep must be found to breed them for a reliable supply of mutton.
- Salmon cannot be bred, so the player has to hunt for them every time they need food, not to mention salmon are agile and hard to hit.
