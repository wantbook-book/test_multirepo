#### Useful resources
Water, salmon, blue ice, trident, treasure map, prismarine shards, prismarine crystals, gold, sponge, wet sponge, ink sacs, magma block, cod‌[Bedrock Edition  only] are useful resources found in deep frozen oceans.

### Snowy plains
This biome is made up of large expanses of flat, snow-covered grass. These contain scattered trees in about the same density as plains biomes, although spruce trees generate instead of oak. There is also a sub-biome consisting of mountains which, while tall, are not as tall as the ones in the mountain biome. This biome can be beautiful, but the cold can make finding a reliable food source difficult.

#### Pros
- Plenty of snow and ice.
- The snowy landscape can be appealing, especially when near to its mountain sub-biome or other snowybiomes.
- Igloossometimes generate here and contain the basic necessities for a starting player: a bed, crafting table, and furnace. Furthermore, an igloo has a 50% chance of containing a basement (under thecarpet), which can contain rare treasures like abrewing standand a weakness potion, as well as having a loot chest with basic loot and onegolden apple, and cauldron. The player also finds twovillagers, one being azombie villager, locked in cages.
- Snowy villages can generate here.
	- Village shepherd houses generate chests which can be looted.
	- Snowy villages are the only place where sheep, cows and pigs spawn in this biome.
	- Some snowy village houses are made out of packed ice and blue ice.
- InBedrock Edition, skeletons and strays are the only monsters that can spawn in this biome, so the underground may be safe to explore as the only other mobs that can spawn are zombies from sieges,pillagersfrompillager patrolsand mobs frommonster spawners.
- Rabbitscan spawn here.

#### Cons
- The cold temperature means any exposed water in this biome freezes without a nearby heat source, making farming difficult without light sources.
- Cows, pigs, and sheep spawn only as part of village generation.
- Polar bearsspawn fairly frequently and attack when approached if there is a nearby cub (otherwise they attack only when hit).
- When it snows, snow layers are created on any flat, solid blocks, which can be a nuisance.
- Top snow can stack during snowfall.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
- During the night,straysspawn on the surface. Unlike skeletons, strays shoot arrows ofSlowness, which makes it harder to either advance or run away.
- Pillager outposts can generate.

#### Useful resources
Snow, ice, igloos (and any rare loot they generate with), snowy villages, pillager outposts, arrows of Slowness from strays, raw salmon and raw cod from polar bears, rabbits and spruce wood from trees are useful resources found in snowy plains biomes.

#### Tips
- If low on wood, a snowy or normal taiga biome is usually nearby.
- Polar bears are generally best avoided unless the player needs theraw codorsalmonthey drop.
- Light sources keep snow layers from forming on blocks.
- Village farms are usually lit up, providing an easy first farm.

### Mountains
Mountains are often sights to behold, usually reaching high above the clouds. They often begin from a meadow biome near the ground, and as the altitude increases you may find snowy slopes or sparse forests. Depending on the type of peak, there may be a jagged stone peak, a snow-capped peak, or a more flat icy peak. Goats can often be found jumping around the higher areas of mountains, but be careful that you don't get rammed off the mountain by their horns. Watch your step, as you may find yourself sinking into powder snow, which slowly freezes you to death if you do not escape. 

#### Pros
- The views from on top of the mountains are spectacular, though a higher render distance may be required to see the bottom of the mountain.
- Some mountains may have a caldera/basin formation at the top, a secluded area surrounded by snowy slopes.
- Goats can sometimes drop their horns when they charge into certain blocks. These horns are mainly aesthetic, but the sounds they make can be used for communication in multiplayer.
- Emerald ore generates here, mountains being the only biome (alongside extreme hills) to do so.
- Thedeep darkcave biome is typically generated under mountains, and thus anancient citymay be underneath the mountain, ready to be looted.

#### Cons
- This is the biome the player is most likely to die from fall damage in. Take care when climbing or descending.
- Powder snow can be quite dangerous, and there is plenty of it hidden along the snowy slopes. Leather boots can be worn to prevent the player from sinking into it, so having a pair on hand when in this biome is a must.

#### Useful resources
Goats, goat horns, snow, packed ice, emeralds, stone, spruce wood.

### Ice spikes
Ice spikes is an interesting biome with its random giant spires of packed ice, which have a pleasant appearance, but also, like the badlands, lacks resources. This biome is also good for building homes that are more for show than for function. The taller ice spikes can be made into a tower with some work, although inside, it is little more than a spiral staircase with a room on top. The smaller ones can also be hollowed out and used to make an igloo. If you decide to live in an ice spikes biome, try to find one that is near a snowy taiga biome, so that you can harvest wood more easily.

#### Pros
- This is one of the places where you can naturally findpacked icebesides the frozen ocean and snowy villages.
- The scene is beautiful and unique.
- Great source of ice and snow.
- The packed ice can be used as spawn areas for mob grinders, or to craft blue ice.
- A good place for ice-related builds.
