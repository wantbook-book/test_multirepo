# Tutorials/Island survival
An "island" in Minecraft is typically any collection of terrain that is above sea level and is surrounded by water on all sides. Islands often generate in relatively remote areas and are often cut off from the mainland. If a player happens to spawn on one of these, they may be faced with a major resource shortage.

An immediate option would be to simply create a new world, but for many players the challenge is appealing.

## Know your environment
Islands often generate in remote areas. Often, no other land is visible, and the island you are on may host just one tree, or just a few trees. If the island has no trees and the bonus chest option is turned off, you may want to start a new world, or try to find a different island, unless you want the challenge.

When on an island, few to no animals may be present. It may be worth keeping animals alive for their resources. For example:

- A singlechickenlays eggs, which can be thrown to get a chance to spawn a chick, which then grows into a chicken and can be bred with the first chicken to produce more.
- A singlesheepis your best option for creating a bed, once you find two blocks of iron ore to smelt into ingots and createshearsfor gettingwool. Shears and abucketare good first uses of iron. You can also use fourstringto craft a block of wool, but this requires killing a lot of spiders, and string should be prioritized for making a fishing rod.

When on small island in a deep ocean, ironically, you don't have to worry much about monsters if the island is small enough to be within the minimum 24-block spawning range. Drowned may spawn in the ocean but they typically don't emerge from the water in a deep ocean. This is the situation with the "Ocean Monuments Ahead" seed in the Bedrock Edition seed picker. With larger islands, it is a good idea to light it up as soon as possible to prevent monsters from spawning on it.

As soon as you get the chance, look around and out to sea: are you on a solitary island or is the island you are on part of a larger group of islands, an island chain or archipelago?

If the former is the case, then you should focus on what the island you are on has to offer and try to establish yourself.

If the latter is the case, however, then it may (depending on resources, time and how far apart the islands are) be worth taking a look at what the other islands have to offer as well. They could contain what your island lacks that you need to survive.

## Surviving your first night
Before doing anything else, go to the nearest tree and collect the wood. If it is the only tree on the island, harvest the leaves first, because they drop saplings that can be planted to get more wood. Plant the saplings immediately after harvesting the wood. This is vital for obtaining more wood and more saplings. Oak trees can even yield apples, which can be used as an early food source.

If the island has any flowers, try putting oak, mangrove or birch saplings next to a flower, to give the sapling a 1⁄20 chance of growing with a bee nest, which can be useful as a source of honey and honeycomb. Trees that don't grow bee nests can be harvested again.

Because resources are low, craft only a minimal number of essential things.

## Food
With good strategic resource management, there should be little fear of running out of food. To conserve energy the first few days, be conservative with moving around, and avoid sprinting and jumping altogether, if possible.

### Food from plant sources
Without animals, there are ways to get food:

- Kelpis an easy initial source of food, which can usually be found offshore a short swim, and can be broken by hand. When broken deep down (leaving one block to continue growing) all the kelp above the breaking point breaks and floats to the surface. It is easy to harvest a lot of kelp quickly, and safe to do on the first day before threatened by hostile mobs. It must be smelted in a furnace first to getdried kelp. Dried kelp can, in turn, be used to craftdried kelp blocks, which function both as a substitute building block and furnace fuel.
- Farming cropsis a simple and easy source of renewable food. A farm can be created on any island. Look forshort grassand break it by hand, and you may get somewheat seedsbefore exhausting the supply of short grass, althoughbone mealcan be used ongrass blocksto grow more short grass.
	- Just one seed is enough to start a farm. Put a block of dirt level with the shore water up to 4 blocks from the shore, craft a woodenhoeand use it on the dirt to turn it intofarmland, and plant the seeds. Wait for them to mature before harvesting the wheat, which also yields more seeds, allowing for expansion of the farm. Threewheatcan be crafted intobread, which is a good food source.
	- With a farm, you can growwheat,carrots,potatoes,beetroot, and other crops. Some crops can be used to breed animals, if animals are available to breed.
- Fishingwith afishing rodis the best way to get high-saturation foods once you have twostringfrom killingspiders. Crafting a fishing rod gives an infinite supply of good food, and it is usually renewable as damaged enchanted fishing rods are often fished up.
	- While fish may be eaten raw, they are most nourishing when cooked. You need 8cobblestonesfor afurnaceas well as fuel (wood logs, or logs smelted intocharcoal, which is the more efficient fuel) to cook the fish. An alternative option is to make acampfire, which requires no fuel apart from the charcoal or coal used to craft it and cooks four pieces at a time.
	- Swimming after fish to kill them with a weapon or pickaxe risks being attacked bydrowned. On the other hand, killing a fish this way can also drop abone, which can be crafted intobone mealfor speeding up the growth of crops and trees.
- Applesoccasionally drop from oakleaves(1⁄200drop chance) when broken or decayed. Of course, this requires the island to have an oak tree.
- Carrotsandpotatoesare also rare drops fromzombies, but not available early in-game. These can also be found from shipwreck chests later in the game.
- Rotten fleshis a last-resort when all else has failed. Wait until zombies spawn at night and kill them, or wait until morning when they burn in sunlight to get rotten flesh.
