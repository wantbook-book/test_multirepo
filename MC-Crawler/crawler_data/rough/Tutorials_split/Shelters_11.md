### Quarry
A Quarry yields large amounts of materials such as cobblestone and dirt to make your buildings, and coal and iron to make tools and torches. It can require several days of game-play to finish building. Some rarer materials like gold can be found as well. See the quarry page for instructions.

### Mining shaft sunroof
Making a sunroof that points directly down your mining shaft has its advantages: you can tell the time of day more easily, and burn mobs like zombies and skeletons. The sunroof can also provide enough light to discourage other mobs from spawning in your mine.

### Lava beacon
Make a large pillar of stone or any non-flammable material and pour a lava bucket on it. It helps when you are a long way from home. Make sure not to build it too close to your base if it's made out of a flammable material.

### 
No mobs can spawn on glass floors, making for a handy alternative to a well-lit shelter. Light is still important, though; you could even have a 1 block high space below all glass blocks on the floor and pour lava there. This keeps your shelter visible and provide a fancy, creepy feel.

### Doorbell
Players (and mobs) entering your house without your knowledge is a pain, that's why you need a doorbell. When a mob or player steps on the pressure plate the note block plays a sound, and you can make this more sophisticated making chimes or even a whole song that play upon entering.
If you have multiple entrances to your base, place different blocks under each note block to make sure that if a creeper comes to your west entrance, you don't get blown up when you try to run away through that door.

### Blinker beacon
A more technical variation on the Lighthouse: the light blinks on and off like a real lighthouse.
You may also use a minecart rail system, which can be made so you put down rails in a square(4 rails on every side), then put down a booster and detector rail, power the booster, and connect the detector rail to the torches you want to blink with redstone. Place a minecart on the booster and it loops forever.
This can be used to blink multiple torches with the same system, and does not require maintenance. You can connect more detector rails for faster blinking speed.

### 
If you find yourself using boats in a general area often, making a dock or two is a good idea. They can help prevent your boats from drifting off into the ocean, or slamming into a wall when you exit, thus breaking the boat. Dispensers can also be placed here and filled with boats for convenience. Chests filled with boats are a good idea too. There are several ways to make useful docks.

- Placing half-blocks in the water. When a boat moves on top, it slows down and stop immediately. Half blocks are shorter, so your boat does not collide with it and break.

Warning: it is recommended to only use this method on Peaceful difficulty and to land on the half blocks at a lower speed, since instant death is possible when landing on half blocks at a higher speed.

- A closed dock. One type of dock is by making a small area (2×3 or larger) that is filled with water. You can place doors in the water to prevent your boat from drifting off.Soul sandis a suggested building material, as it prevents all of the impact damage from colliding with a wall made out of it.

- Water currents. By using a bucket to remove the top layer in 2+ deep water, you create a + shaped water current flowing toward the center. You can use this to hold boats, while still being able to escape somewhat easily. This design does not always prevent the boats from moving if you or a mob bumps into it, but helps prevent it from drifting away.

### Fridge
Create a fridge by placing a dispenser on the ground, a block on it and a button on the side of the block to quickly get something to eat when you're starved. Add a door in front of the dispenser if you feel it would look better, or if you just like the idea.

### Miniature zen garden
Either above the surface or underground, create decorative minimalistic works of art using water currents, plants/crops/flowers, sand, clever use of fence posts, signs, torches, etc.

### Fountain
You need 22 stone and a bucket of water. Make a 5×5 square with the nine in the middle taken out so the water won't spill, then make a 4 block high pillar in the middle and place the water on top of the highest block. Taking out the stone pillar in the middle of the fountain can look nice, and placing half-blocks around the stone blocks can look fairly cool. You can also make the fountain a source of light by replacing the stone pillar with glowstone. After making a fountain like this, you could experiment with making fountains in other ways.

### Piston doors

These look cool. Have these anywhere in your house: library, craft room, furnace room, you name it. All you need is redstone, sticky pistons, and levers. Be sure to keep them hidden if the rooms are secret. A good way to do so is hide the device you use to power the pistons.

### Tunnel to a stronghold
After you find a stronghold, make a tunnel to it. This is an easy way to get to and from the End. Keep it well lit and defended so that if a creeper runs into you in the stronghold, it can't follow you back to your base and blow it up.

### Add a carpet
You can spice up your base by adding a carpet made out of colored wool. Make sure that fire and lava aren't within two blocks from the carpet, otherwise your carpet goes up in flames! Bright colors, like red, blue and purple are recommended, because black and gray carpets don't have the same feel. Try mixing colors together in cool patterns if you're looking to give a room a bit of flair. With the new carpets added in snapshot 13w16a, you can carpet the upper floors of your base without having your lower floors' ceiling made of wool.
