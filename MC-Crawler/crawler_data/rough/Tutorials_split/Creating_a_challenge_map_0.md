## Planning
If your map is going to be more than a sequential bunch of random puzzles, it is very helpful to plan out your map in advance.
Though a plan can range from a simple bullet list to a block-by-block blueprint of the entire world, a good plan should include:

- Theme of the map; what it will be about
- Type of map
- General storyline (if any—used more for story-based adventure maps)
- A basic outline of what traps, challenges and dungeons you will put in (what they are and where they will be)
- Basic blueprints for any large structures that will be put in the map
- Redstone contraptionstested in another world.
- Loot and rewards the players will gain along the way

## Types of challenge maps
Before you choose to make a challenge map, you need to choose what type of map you want it to be.  Here are some types:

** Adventure **
A challenge map made for players that go on an adventure in order to accomplish some goal.  Most of them have the /gamerulekeepInventory to true to make it easier.  E.g.: Zombie apocalypse maps.
** Parkour **
A map that's just made for parkour.
** Survival **
Asurvivalworld that is changed to make survival more difficult, or easy.  A good example is the Skyblock map.
** Puzzle **
A map that's made for puzzles.
** Game **
A Minecraft mini-game, showcased in the form of a challenge map.
** PvP **
Maps made for PvP.
** Arena **
An arena with mobs spawning that you must defeat.
** Dropper **
A type of map when you need to survive falls in style.
** Capture The Flag **
A type of PvP, but the goal is to capture the other teams' flag(s)
** Minigames **
A map designed to have many different and random minigames that players can play.
** Role-Play (RP) **
RP maps are simulation maps that are related to jobs or situations in real life. These maps are best to be played in multiplayer.
** Tycoon **
Tycoon games is where you have some type of money-making machine, which you can upgrade over time to produce more money. You can use that money to build specific things in your map. For example, If the tycoon is a building, then you need to save (not actual price) $5,400 to build it. You know when a tycoon is finished when all the land plots are bought, and the map is filled in.
## Tips and tricks
### Customize the Superflat world type
See also: Superflat § Customization

Changing the Superflat options can make a good Superflat survival world.

### Make a spawn area
See also: Spawn

You could make a spawn pad, a pre-made house, or anything you can think of!

- Top tip: If players will be in survival, you must add spawn jails to prevent players from escaping! (seeTutorials/Spawn jail)

### Add bonuses
Hide some little rewards for the player. Extra surprises make a challenge map exciting and fun.
Diamonds or emeralds work well, because it can be a fun way to keep score. If you want a surprise ending for the players to build up to (literally and figuratively), make the maximum bonus count a multiple of 9, only if the prizes are diamonds, gold, lapis, emeralds, or iron (maybe even coal!) to make the necessary block; for others, it may vary.

Beacons give extraordinary powers, so you can add a mystic powers room. Power the beacon so that it produces haste, speed, strength powers etc. You can also add an enchantment table, the experience farm outlet, and some positive splash potion dispensers (maybe add some negatives for the lulz.)

### Make obstacles
Add pits, traps, and more to your map to make it more interesting and challenging. Check out the Puzzles and Traps section of this page for more. Note that if you want to build something enormous and complicated, such as a giant slime dispenser of doom, you would probably want to have a lot of redstone and/or MCEdit knowledge.
