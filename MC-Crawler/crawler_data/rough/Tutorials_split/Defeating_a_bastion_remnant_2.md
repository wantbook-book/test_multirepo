#### Potions
If you have already gathered blaze rods and nether wart from a nether fortress, splash potions can prove effective against piglin brutes, especially if you encounter a group of them.  Slowness can slow down their fast movement speed, poison can allow you to gradually drain their health while staying at a safe distance (it also damages them without angering other piglins), and weakness can help reduce their massive attack damage, which also reduces the penalty to armor that their heavy hits cause.  If you're in a pinch and need to make a quick escape, a Turtle Master potion augmented with glowstone dust, while making piglin brutes incredibly resistant to damage, will slow down their movement speed to 10% of normal speedâ€”even stronger than an augmented Slowness potion.

You can also use a potion of Harming to instantly deal a large amount of damage.  However, unlike poison, harming potions will anger nearby piglins.

Bringing a drinkable Fire Resistance potion is also a good idea for any nether trip in general should you lose your footing and fall in lava.

### Piglins
There are many ways to overcome piglins. Here is a list:

- Wear at least 1 piece of golden armor.This stops the piglins from being initially hostile and allows you to travel relatively safely through the bastion, especially after clearing all of the piglin brutes out.
	- However:  Attacking a piglin brute will make all the piglins and piglin brutes in range become hostile, which can pose a problem since piglin brutes will attack you regardless of what armor you're wearing.  As usual, so will using a chest or barrel, or mining any golden block including ores,  However, if you can block them off or otherwise shelter yourself from them, their aggro will wear off in the usual 30 seconds after the brute is dealt with.
- 2 or 3-block tall pillar (not recommended for piglins with crossbows)
- Boats (works best for melee piglins)
- Summoningiron golems
- Distraction by dropping golden items
- Taking advantage of their fears by placingsoul torchesor using other soul fire.
- To prevent angering the piglins:
	- UsingTNT. However, don't light up the TNT with aflint and steelor afire charge, or else the game will know that TNT was ignited by a player, and the piglins get angry.  Instead, usebuttonsor pressure plates to light up the TNT, as the piglins will not get angry at you for hurting them that way.  Their lack of knowledge about redstone is intentional.
	- Lava bucketscan also damage piglins without angering them, as Minecraft does not keep track of who placed the lava.
	- Placinghoppersunder their chests, taking advantage of their ignorance of redstone. Note that chests now have gilded blackstone under them, so mining it out to make space for the hopper will anger the piglins anyway. Conversion to a double chest or using a piston to move the block underneath will solve this issue, and let you safely loot from the hopper.
	- If you can kill the brutes and perhaps the crossbow piglins from shelter or a pillar, you can then wait for the others to calm down, which will take about 30 seconds.  Throwing gold at them will help.
- For crossbow wielding piglins, you might want to do traditional ranged combat by simply shooting at them with bows and crossbows. Melee is also viable if you can get close to it and you have a shield to negate all of the damage and knockback taken. A shield is incredibly helpful in general when fighting them, as it can prevent you from getting knocked off of ledges.
- When groups of piglins become hostile, RUN AWAY. Get as far as you can away from the bastion, and simply return later. Being surrounded in piglins is NOT a good feeling. Alternatively, if you can find a corridor and block off the passageway with blocks letting none of them through. Then simply wait for them to calm down, and problem solved!
- Pouring lava on them.

### Hoglins
Hoglins don't appear in bastion remnants too often, but they do sometimes. Keep these in mind when fighting them:

- Hoglins can attack from a 3 block tall pillar, but not a 4 block tall pillar. Although you cannot hit them from 4 blocks, you can still shoot them. If you make a 3 block tall pillar, it is possible to kill Hoglins with melee weapon as long as you don't lean too far over the edge.
- Piglins will never hunt any hoglins generated in bastion remnants. Don't rely on piglins to kill the hoglins for you.
- It is extremely hard for hoglins to get in boats. Instead, take advantage of the fact they can't fit through 1 block wide spaces[Java Edition only].
- If you must engage in melee combat with a hoglin, use a sword withKnockbackII,SharpnessI-V, andFire Aspect.
- It's a good idea to bring some warpedfungusto scare away the hoglins, but make sure you also have flower pots or dirt to place them on.
