### Shifting to one side
Often you may want to continue a flow in the same direction but shift it to one side by one or more blocks, to align the flow with something ahead. You can stack these single-block shifts, making a diagonal channel, until the water runs out, and then you must create a new gap. Just make a channel that keeps shifting to the left or right as needed.

The directional shift (not the flow) can be perpendicular to the desired direction, or diagonal. The boat's movement is slightly faster with the gentler turn into a diagonal flow.

Alternative 3-block shift without diagonals. In this case the next turn or shift must be in the same direction (left).

Either the first or second designs can be adjusted easily for a two-block shift.

### Example: Endlessly circling moat
See also: Tutorials/Endless circling pool

The smallest endlessly circling moat that can accommodate a boat.
The smallest circling pool that can accommodate a boat has one solid block in the center and four quadrants of water flowing from one corner of each quadrant. This design requires a 7×7 area, 1 layer, 4 water source blocks, and 8 buttons or signs — one on each side of the central block and one on the wall opposite each central sign or button.

The smallest circling pool that can accommodate a boat, using four water source blocks and eight buttons.
This can be used as an AFK pool for the purpose of continually moving to avoid getting kicked off a server. The advantage over a normal AFK pool is that you don't get hungry because you're in a boat.

Remember, in Java Edition you need to use signs, not buttons. You can use either signs or buttons in Bedrock Edition.


## Floating uphill

  

This tutorial is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition. 


In Java Edition, the simplest way to make a boat float uphill is to use soul sand to build a bubble column elevator, although this requires a foray into The Nether or an ancient city to obtain the soul sand. The technique described in this section for floating a boat uphill doesn't work in Java Edition because boats want to sink, whereas in Bedrock Edition, boats want to float.

In Bedrock Edition, it is actually possible to cause a boat to be propelled uphill using only the power of water flow; no fancy techniques like pistons or bubble columns are required. A boat can be made to float up a slope as steep as 1⁄2 (one block elevation per two blocks horizontal distance) with careful attention to water flow management.

The concept involves a zig-zag water flow, changing diagonal direction at each step, while ensuring that all surface water is flowing, and the necessary deeper water at the step is used to buoy the boat up into the flowing water. As with the level-ground water management techniques described above, each section of water flow must push the boat across an empty space into the next flow, and the next flow must pull the boat out from the previous flow.

### Basic up-step
To float a boat up a step, the construction requires blocks to form a channel with a step, four buttons (or signs), one water block, and one temporary block (such as dirt) to be removed as the final step.

In the blueprints below:

- Stone represents the water channel.
- The water flow direction isupin these illustrations.
- The buttons are shown unattached in the diagrams. Each button is actually attached to the channel wall nearest to the button.
- The incoming water is assumed to be diagonal flow up toward the temporary dirt block.

The final block to be placed is the water source block. The temporary block of dirt causes the water to flow over the step. Without the block of dirt, the water simply stops at the step. After the water is placed, destroy the block of dirt.

** Up step with zigzag flow left to right **
The incoming water in the lower channel should be upward diagonal flow toward the dirt block on the left. The water block on the left resumes the flow diagonally upward to the right.

** Up step with zigzag flow right to left **
Each successive step is a mirror image of the prior one. Here, the incoming water in the lower channel should be upward diagonal flow toward the dirt block on the right. The water block on the right resumes flow diagonally upward to the left.

Remember the dirt block shown is temporary. It must be removed after placing the water source block.
