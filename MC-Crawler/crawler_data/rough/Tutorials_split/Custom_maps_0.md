## Map types
Playing the maps is the most fun part. Custom maps often have objectives and sometimes a storyline. They can be great fun and there are many types. Here are a few of the types, as well as some tips to completing them.

### Puzzle
A fork shown in a Minecraft maze made of sandstone.
These are obstacle courses involving puzzles to complete. They might have a scoring system, such as chests hidden with gold. The more you collect, the higher your score. Here are some obstacles you may see:

- RedstonePuzzles. These will give you some redstone components, such as arepeateror two and someredstone dust, and ask you to rewire a door or something to open. Check the relative redstone sections on them in this wiki to find some tips on how to make the most of what you have.
- Mazes. Wander around narrow paths aimlessly until you see a door. Mazes can be very fun to play. At each fork, it may help to mark chosen paths with a torch to track where you have been.

### Action
Generally, these maps involve fighting and survival skills.

- Survival Maps. Like regular Minecraftsurvival, but with a twist. You may be in theclouds, have limited resources/space, etc.
- CTM maps. Short for "Complete the Monument", these maps are known to be very difficult. The goal is to complete a "Victory Monument", where you have to fill it up withwool, records, or some other type of items. These maps have many traps along the way.
- Arena Maps. These maps have stages and in each stage, you must fight a wave ofmobsin order to progress.

### PVP
These maps are for Player vs. Player. They are great if you get tired of fighting the same in-game mobs, since the AI can be very predictable.

- Race For Wool maps. This is when teams of four go into a lane and try to complete a monument there. They include dungeons and crossfire from the other lanes. This is a type of CTM.
- Capture The Wool maps. This is where people rush to the opponent's base and attempt to steal wool from a fleecy box (wool chest). They then have to return to their base. Can be played in small or large groups.
- Destroy the Monument/Core maps. Self-explanatory. Usually only played in large groups, sometimes up to 50v50.
