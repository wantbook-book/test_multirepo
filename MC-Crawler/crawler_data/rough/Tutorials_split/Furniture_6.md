### Sink
A sink allows you to have a water supply right in your kitchen. Many sinks use a 2×2 square. You could also create a 1×1 block sink just for show, or a flowing sink. You can use a cauldron filled with water (or alternatively a hopper) and then, a lever (or tripwire hook) above it representing the tap. Putting iron blocks below or surrounding your sink would look cool, or gold or diamond blocks if you have the resources.

Materials Needed:

- 1cauldronorhopper
- 1leverortripwire hook
- 1bucketof water if you use a cauldron (optional)

1. Place the cauldron or hopper against the wall.

2. Place the lever or tripwire hook above the cauldron.

(Optional) Last, fill the cauldron with water from your bucket.





Cleaning sink

After Java Edition 1.4.2, Minecraft added the ability where one could use the water-filled cauldron to remove any kind of dye from any kind of dyed leather armor. Right after Java Edition 1.8, in which banners were added, cauldrons got another use of removing the last pattern on a banner. Thus, this design is now useful.

### Fridge
You can make a refrigerator for a nice finish, and to make your kitchen more distinguished. Many fridge designs allow you to store food inside them, making them functional as well as decorative.


Design 1

Materials: 

- 1 Chest
- 1 Iron block (Quartz or Snow for alternate texture packs)
- 1 Iron door
- 1 Lever

This fridge will look fancy and you will have the ability to store items. Firstly dig a block where you want to put your fridge, then put in there a chest, leave the above block blank. Put above the blank space an Iron/Quartz/Snow Block, then put an iron door and a lever above or next to it.

Layer 1








Layer 2










Design 2

Materials:

- 1dispenser
- 1block of iron
- 1iron door
- 1button

This fridge will give you food when you need some.
Place a dispenser on the ground with an iron block on it (you could also place the dispenser on top of the iron block).
Place an iron door in front of those and place a button on the iron block. When you press the button, the door will open and the dispenser will drop the food you stored. You can also use a dropper instead of a dispenser.















Layer 1














Layer 2


Design 3

Materials:

- 2 Iron blocks
- 1 Button
- 1 Dispenser

This fridge needs to be built on a wall. To build it, dig one block into the wall. Place a dispenser in the wall, and from inside fill it with food. Place two iron blocks in a stack in front of it. Place a button on either side of the bottom block.
When you press the button, instant food! Perfect if you need some food in a hurry.


Design 4

Materials:

- 1 dispenser
- 1 iron block
- 1 iron door
- 1 button or lever

Place a dispenser and on top, put an iron block. Then, place an iron door in front of it, and put a button or lever on the iron block. Then just fill the dispenser.


Design 5

Materials:

- 7 iron blocks
- 3 sticky pistons
- 2 Redstone torches
- 1 lever
- 8 (?) Redstone dust
- 1 Block (any kind) to place some of the Redstone dust on
- 1 ice block (Obtained in survival with silk touch or pushed into place with pistons)
- 1 chest
- 3 stone slabs

To set up this fridge, make 2 wide and 3 tall rectangles out of the iron. Make sure it is against a wall and in a corner. On the side facing into the corner, cut out the walls and place the sticky pistons, setting up Redstone torches appropriately as inverters to the pistons. Then, attach the lever to the 2nd block up on the non-piston-attached side. Wire this lever into the piston inverters, and voila, a working fridge. inside the fridge, place an iron block in the middle, a stone slab as the roof, and put a chest in the top space. At the bottom, put a block of ice in as a sort of "freezer."


Design 6

Materials:

- 4 of any solid block
- 1rail
- 1Minecart with chest
- 1piston(not sticky)
- 6-8 blocks of the material you want your fridge to be made of (I.E- iron or quartz)
- 1redstone torchorredstone block

This is a good fridge that can make a tower, three blocks high, of any solid block. Now add another solid block in front of the three high stacks. Add a rail to it. Put a storage minecart on top of the rail. Destroy the block with the rail on it so that the minecart fawn.
Add a piston on the top of the 'tower', facing down. Now, put the block underneath the piston that you want your fridge to be made out of (I.E- if you want an iron fridge, the block underneath the piston would be iron). Now put a Redstone torch/block on top of the tower. This will force the piston down. Destroy the piston, the tower, and the Redstone torch/block. You should be left with a block with a shading error. Add blocks around it so that you can't see the black… stuff. You now have a fridge!


Design 7
by -metalmanII- 

Materials:

- 2 dispensers
- Iron door
- 2 buttons
- 2 blocks of any kind (preferably iron blocks, you can use the blocks of your wall material if you are building this fridge into a wall)

Instructions: place 2 dispensers one on top of the other, then fill with food.

Jump on top and place an iron door so it is touching the dispensers.

On either side place your 2 blocks, one on top of the other.

Add buttons to these blocks.

Result: a nice compact fridge! When you press one of the buttons, the door opens and one of the dispensers launches food out, then the door closes.


Design 8

Materials:

- 6 iron blocks
- 1 iron door
- 1 pressure plate (not weighted) or 1 lever
- 1 chest
- 1 quartz stair (optional)

Once you pick a spot along a wall where the fridge is going to go, dig a two-block deep hole and place one iron block at the bottom of it. Next, put the chest inside that hole, then destroy the three blocks behind, left, and right of the chest. replace those blocks with iron blocks. Next, place an iron block two spaces up (if you place a solid block directly on top of the chest it won't open, therefore, make one space between the chest and the iron block). Optional: At this point, you can place an upside-down quartz stair on the iron block. Since the quartz stair is not a solid block, the chest can still be accessed. However, the quartz stair will not match the iron blocks, so they may need to be replaced by quartz blocks, but they will still not match the iron door. If you do not plan to use the quartz stair, place an iron block on top of the iron block behind the chest. 

Next, jump on top of the iron block (which should only be two spaces above ground) and place the iron door in front of the iron block, making the door and the block touch. Jump down and place the pressure plate in front of the door, or place the lever on the side of the iron block. You will notice that on each side of the fridge there are holes, just places things next to it (i.e. walls, wood planks, crafting tables, etc.). Now you are done, you can put perishable foods in the chest like milk or eggs. 


Design 9

Materials:

- 2 iron blocks
- 1 stone button

Place the iron into a 1×2 rectangle, then put the button on the top block. There you have it. A simple and pretty decorative fridge. It looks chunky, but it's still pretty cool.


Design 10

Materials:

- 2/3 iron doors
- 1 stone slab
- 1 chest
- 1 stone button

Depending on where you want your fridge, place the first iron door on the inner side of a block to the left or right of where you want your fridge. Then place the other iron door on the other side, leaving one blank block in between. Third, place your chest, and the last door in front of the chest. On top, place the stone slab. Finally place the button so you can open one of the 3 doors, whichever works for your room layout. 
To make a corner fridge with this method, you will only need 2 iron doors, with the layout like so:

 * S *
 * C D
 BD *


Design 11

Materials:

- 1 iron door
- 8 iron blocks (you can use snow too)
- 1 lever
- 1 daylight sensor

Find a place in your wall where you would like to put your fridge (NOTE: this must be at least 2 blocks away from anything you don't want to dig into). 
Dig into your wall 3 at eye level and 2 deep on the bottom.
Dig behind your wall 2 wide.

After following these instructions, your wall should look like this from overhead:



|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |


Next, you will start placing your blocks.

Place two-high iron blocks in all of your empty spaces minus the two in the middle.

It should look like this now.



|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |



Now, place a block in the middle of all of your iron blocks (note that the one in the middle is lower than the others).



|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |


Finally, put a daylight sensor on top of that block, a door in front, and a lever on the wall next to that.



|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Tip: The daylight sensor can be clicked once to make it look like a freezer pack. Or, if you want to leave your fridge door open and click it again, it will look like you're letting the cold air out and you need to refreeze your freezer packs. 

 Design 12 

Materials:

- 1 iron door
- 1 iron block
- 1 rail
- 1 minecart with chest
- 1 lever

First, place the iron block on the wall 2 blocks above the floor.
Place the rail under the iron block, then put the minecart on the rail back into the fridge. 
Look down, place the door, then place the lever next to it.
Now, you have a nice looking fridge!

So functional due to minecarts with chests not needing a free space above it to open it. 

Note: this looks best with counters on the sides.

Design 13

Design 13 should look somewhat like this when finished
Materials

- 1 hopper
- 1 button
- 2 blocks of iron
- 1 dispenser or dropper

Wherever you want a fridge, dig a 2-block-across hole (1 block down). On the far end of the hole, put a dispenser/dropper facing you. On the inside of the hole, put a hopper that goes into the dispenser/dropper. Next, put 2 blocks of iron on top of the dispenser/dropper and put a button on the lower iron block. The finished fridge should look like this:

To get some food from the fridge, press the button and the dispenser/dropper will drop food at your feet.
To put food in your fridge, put the food in the hopper using whatever method.

Design 14, made by Logan5123

- 1 Redstone
- 2 of any block, quartz looks the best
- 1 button
- 1 iron door
- 2 dispensers

First, place your two dispensers on top of each other. Fill the dispensers with food, Then, to the exact left/right block depending on where you are placing it, put the Redstone. Then, in front of the Redstone, stack the blocks and put a button on the bottom block. Place the iron door in front of the dispensers. If you click the button, food comes out and the door closes.

’’’ Design 15, made by Mimiengland’’’

- 2 iron trapdoor
- 2 dispensers
- 2 Stone buttons

Place one dispenser on the floor and the second one on top, place the trapdoors on the dispenser.
Place both buttons on both dispensers. Now you have a freezer and a refrigerator.
