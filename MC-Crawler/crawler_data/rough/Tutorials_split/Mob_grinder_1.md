### Wither roses
Wither roses can be used in a similar manner to magma blocks and sweet berries to kill mobs. Wither roses placed on top of soul sand allow items to sink into soul sand blocks and be picked up by hoppers directly below, avoiding having to use hopper minecarts to pick up items through full blocks.

Wither roses deal the same damage as magma blocks and sweet berries: 1 heart per second. (Also applies the wither effect)

### Lava grinders










































A simple lava grinder.
If you have a lava bucket, a lava grinder is often the simplest and most practical grinder, particularly for iron golems or mob farms that are not high up above the ground.

While lava is good at dealing damage, it also tends to destroy items. This can be fixed by suspending the lava on a sign and pushing the mobs into it. When a mob dies, its items then fall below the lava and into the hopper. This type of grinder is often called a "lava blade."

Another variant is a pool of lava that the mob falls into, with the lava being suspended above a space that the drops fall into.

Lava grinders are typically ineffective against baby zombies, because even if they fall through a pool of lava, they often survive, and they can fit in the one-block space under the lava being suspended by the signs. It is a good idea to put a fence between the hopper and your collection room (a fence over a chest does not prevent the chest from opening). Then, if a baby zombie happens to be waiting on the other side, you can easily kill it.

- Another lava grinder (front view).

Instead of pushing mobs into the lava, it is also possible to douse them using a dispenser. During the short period of time in the lava, the mobs catch fire and are weakened until a player can easily kill them with one or two hits.

### Campfire killer






























































































For normal mobs, only one campfire and one hopper is needed. Two are shown here, as a 2×2 layout of campfires is needed to kill iron golems. Large slimes would need a 3×3 layout.
A campfire killer has advantages over both a lava grinder (above) and a trident killer (below). A campfire does not destroy items like lava can. A campfire can kill nearly any mobs, including baby zombies that would normally fit in a space under lava. While it does not bestow experience on players like a trident killer, a campfire killer is much cheaper and simpler to construct, requiring only water, a sign, a hopper, a chest, a glass block, and a campfire. A campfire requires only wood to make the crafting ingredients. It is an excellent choice for early-game farms.

In the figure on the right, a sign (or a button) is used to stop the water flow. The water pushes the mob onto the campfire. A hopper placed directly underneath a campfire pulls in any items dropped. The hoppers feed into a collection chest. The glass block traps mobs in the campfire space, and glass is useful for viewing the mob being killed. The half-block gap between the glass and the campfire allows for safe manual killing if needed (which gains experience for the player).

Although a campfire damages mobs slowly, it works reasonably well on any mob without fire resistance. Most hostile mobs (creepers, zombie variants, illagers, spiders, etc.) die in less than 10 seconds in a campfire. A campfire kills an iron golem in about 50 seconds. A campfire killer does not work well on witches, because they give themselves potions of Fire Resistance and Healing. A witch can survive indefinitely in a campfire, so if a witch gets stuck in this trap, it should be killed manually.

If you have Soul Sand available, you can make soul campfires instead. These kill twice as fast as regular campfires, and give off less light, which usually makes them a better choice than a normal campfire.

### Trident killer

  

This tutorial is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition. 


Projectiles that can be picked up again by the player after lodging in a block (i.e. arrows and tridents) also have the ability to hit mobs if they are moved after becoming lodged. The total number of hits a projectile can inflict before becoming inert and impossible to retrieve depends on its type and the piercing enchantment: a normal arrow can hit one mob; arrows shot by piercing-enchanted crossbows can hit (enchantment level + 1) mobs; and tridents can hit an infinite number of mobs.[1]  Hits inflicted by moving the projectile after it has been lodged in a block count as hits for the player who launched the projectile, even hours later and/or while the player is no longer nearby. Such hits cause the mob to drop experience and player-kill loot as long as the player who launched the projectile is loaded somewhere in the world. In addition, the loot dropped is subject to the looting buff if the player holds a looting sword in the main hand at the time the kill occurs.

Trident killers make use of these mechanics to produce a completely automatic method of killing mobs and making them drop experience and other player exclusive loot. They work by throwing a trident into a mechanism that uses a piston to push the trident into mobs and a clock circuit to power the piston on and off.

Trident killers provide a way to get large amounts of player-kill loot and experience from a farm without the need for repetitive clicking and travel between different kill locations. Many Bedrock mob farms are much less productive than their Java counterparts due to differences in the spawning algorithms. Moreover, since Bedrock Edition does not have the sweep attack, it can be difficult to kill large quantities of mobs manually with a sword. Players may therefore wish to enhance the effectiveness of their farms by limiting the distance mobs must travel before being killed, and by using the looting enchantment while still killing mobs automatically. Trident killers make this possible. They allow for remote player kills in small, separated modules of a farm, and they allow the player to get the looting buff on those kills. On top of these benefits, tridents in trident killers never despawn. Tridents decrease in durability only when they are thrown. Because the trident is thrown only once, a trident killer can run indefinitely without needing to be supplemented with additional tridents.

Because tridents cannot be crafted or found in chests, they must be obtained by hunting drowned or by building an aerial drowned farm. Only one trident is needed for a trident killer, and it only needs one point of durability to work.

It is recommended to enchant the trident with Impaling V, as it will improve the efficiency of the trident killer. Waterlogging the pistons is required for this method, so trident killers with observers are recommended.
