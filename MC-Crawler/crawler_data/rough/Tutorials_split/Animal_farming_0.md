# Tutorials/Animal farming
Players may find themselves in need of cooked meats, leathers, feathers, wool, eggs, rabbit hides or rabbit's foots in large quantities, or need to gain experience from animals. A quick hunt across a large area may temporarily provide a player with these. However, due to slow passive mob spawning mechanics in Minecraft, mobs may not spawn quick or many enough to meet these demands in smallest amount of effort and time. This may force players to hunt elsewhere in further new chunks.

To prevent this issue, players can herd a small supply of livestock, breeding them to create new livestock, and then kill a portion of the adults whenever the player needs more meats and other drops. Manual slaughter farms also provide a modest amount of experience from breeding and killing animals, but this should not be the main focus of an animal farm. For players interested in farming experience quickly for enchanting or other needs, they should focus on hostile mob farms.

This tutorial page aims to explain some methods used to manually, semi-automatically, and automatically farm cows, sheeps, pigs and chickens (see egg farming).

## Basic farming
1. Round up at least two animals of the same kind into a pen.Fencesare useful, but you can also dig a hole 2 blocks deep so that the animals cannot jump out.
	- You can make the hole as wide as you want to make it easier for them to fall into. In Java Edition, players should be careful ofentity crammingwhere mobs suffocate to death. This mechanic can be exploited to create farms,like a cow crusher.
	- Rabbitscan jump off a two-block deep gap, but they can't if the hole is at least three deep.
2. Breedthem until you have a reasonable number.
3. Kill some adults to obtain their resources. Do not kill all of them, as it is harder to breed animals again. The less left, the harder it is for them to rebound back to their original numbers.

To lead animals around, you need to wield the same food that you can breed them with or a lead. Leads can be obtained by killing trader llamas or by crafting them, using string and slimeballs.

- Seedsof any type leadchickens.
- Carrots,dandelionsandgolden carrotsmay be used to attractrabbits.

Once they're in the pen and fed, the animals pair off and reproduce. Experience orbs are granted on successful breeding. Both animals cannot breed for five minutes afterward. Two adults make one child per breeding, which take about 20 minutes to grow up and do not drop any items or experience on death before then.

Chickens, apart from being bred with seeds, can also lay eggs that can be thrown for a chance to produce chicks (there is a low chance more than one chicken generates). This process can also be fully automated with the use of dispensers to create a fully automatic chicken farm.

Shearing a sheep yields 1-3 blocks of wool instead of the usual singular block obtained from killing the sheep. This process can also be automated with dispensers. However, sheep must eat a grass block in order to regrow their wool coat, meaning a large pen with plenty grass blocks to recover their wool after shearing is necessary for wool production. Large amounts of sheep can turn all of the grass inside of the farm into dirt, which can be avoided by placing few neighboring grass blocks should be placed outside of reach of the pen where they can safely regrow back into the pen.

A building to house the animals may prove useful useful to avoid nasty surprises in the form of skeletons, creepers, and other hostile mobs from finding their way into the animal pen and creating a mess. Lighting does the same job, but doesn't protect from outside attackers firing in or blocking the entrance, especially in the case of phantoms.

### Entity cramming farm

  

This tutorial is exclusive to  Java Edition.Â 


Only 24 living entities may be in a single block at once before dying from entity cramming. If there is a mix of adult and baby animals, the adults die first, which allows for construction of a farm that relies on entity cramming. This does work for pigs and sheep, but cows are usually chosen for access to leather.

1. Prepare a two-deep hole with solid blocks on all four sides, and a hopper at the bottom pointing under the blocks on one side. Whichever way the hopper points becomes the front of the crusher.
2. Place a chest connected to the hopper, and replace the block over it with an upside-down stair so you can get at the chest.
3. Put a water source at the bottom of the hole, and lead two or more cows to fall into it.
4. Place a fence or wall over the hole to keep the animals in the hole and other things out.
5. Feed the animals until the entity cramming limit is reached.
	- While less effective in that it loses out on experience and looting, it automates the process and drastically reduces the amount of time it takes to farm animals.
