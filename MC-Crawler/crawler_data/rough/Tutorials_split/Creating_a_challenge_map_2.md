Create a maze with netherrack sides at ground level. Set the netherrack on fire. Players will find it hard to complete this maze without a scald. To stop them from jumping over the flames put some floating obsidian, bedrock, or end portal frame blocks, two blocks above the maze path. To make it more challenging for the player, make it a maze that climbs upwards and then add a lever with a sign saying "Trophy," which when pulled will create a lava flow that chases the player, who has to either burn in lava or burn in fire.

#### Be smart...
Put a hard question to solve with 3 answers. To do so, put 3 levers and 3 signs with answers. The correct answer will open a path for the player to pass. Others will throw lava into the room. Take advantage of the fact that dispensers with buckets can place lava, and then suck it back up. Or, if you wish for a fancier way to kill your hapless victims, you can always use command blocks to do cruel stuff, such as striking a player with a lightning bolt, or blow the player up with instantly detonating TNT. Here's the command:

/execute @p ~ ~ ~ summon tnt ~ ~ ~ {ExplosionPower:-10,Fuse:0.5s}

#### 
In a very long corridor/mine, put a block at head height and place a redstone torch on it. Connect it to a sticky piston just below a huge tower of gravel! When the player breaks the torch block, the piston will retract and the gravel will fall down! Alternatively, make a double NOT gate (see Tutorials/Basic logic gates)leading to a command block that teleports the player to a Funbox room! However, this can be bypassed with ender pearls, but you can solve this problem by putting bedrock on the bottom.

#### 
Make a path that goes slightly underground, then fill it to the ceiling with water. Add some air pockets so your players can breathe, using signs or open trapdoors. Spawn some squid to annoy players even more.
In third party mods, you could make the squids hostile and make them shoot ink to damage and blind the players. Or you could go for a similar effect in vanilla Minecraft and have some command blocks that cause Blindness every time the player touches a squid. In addition, you could use pufferfish guardians, to deal damage, or maybe, even, a room with an elder guardian.

"Bedrock!"

Make a BUD switch next to a bed that detects when a player is in that bed. Hook it up to a command block that teleports the player to a bedrock room that you made!

#### Creepers
Creepers are nice for dealing with your challenge map victims but can blow up parts of your structure, so try building the creeper room out of obsidian and add some inaccessible charged creeper spawners. Alternatively you can use /gamerule mobGriefing false to make it so that creepers, endermen, zombies,         ghasts, withers, and ender dragons can't damage the environment.

Also, you might want to drop the player into a pit full of creepers. One of the nice things about this is the pit gets bigger as the creepers blow up. Give them a cheap tool such as an iron pickaxe, to kill the creepers with, and add some small elevations or safe spots, or a complex redstone device that can make them invisible. You could also add a disabled "creeper generator" that adds in creepers, and the player has to break it to stay alive.

Look Before You Detonate

Because of the fact that end crystals explode when broken, you can use these for your advantage when making traps on your custom map.

Put some lines of TNT underground, 1 block under the floor. Line these up to a central end crystal obstructing the player's way. A simple lesson: look before you detonate something.

#### Sand Falls...
Tripwires are a very good tool and plays a role in this trap. Place a tripwire, then wire it up to a set of pistons. Make sure that the tripwire hook is in a place where it's impossible or very difficult for the player to see it. When the player comes along, they will not see the tripwire, so they will trip over the wire, and stumble into a pit that you made beneath the pistons.
Make it fall into a ravine, a funbox or, if you are really mean, an end portal.

#### Run Fast
This trap takes advantage of the very fast speed you can achieve by sprint-jumping in a two-block high passageway. First of all, build a two-block tall passageway of whatever length you want. Put a pressure plate at the beginning of the hallway, and connect it to pistons that will retract the floor. Put in a delay, so that the floor will retract just after a sprint-jumping player gets through. If they aren't fast enough, they fall to the bottom and from there, it's up to you what happens to them...

#### Test Your Brain
Put numbers along with the game that players have to remember, then add a room to enter these numbers. If they get it right, they can move along. If not, they would fall into a deadly trap, such as lava, cactus, or the void. It is probably a good idea to prevent the players from going back to these numbers somehow, for example, using pistons to create a door that locks behind the players. 

If in multiplayer, a good idea is to have one player could be in the number room, and one could be in the question room. The one in the number room can tell the person in the question room the answer, and then the one in the number room is stuck but he can use the tp command to teleport to the one in the question room and carry on (this will only work if cheats are on).
