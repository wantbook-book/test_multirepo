### Update Aquatic
If you are playing in Minecraft after Update Aquatic, there is a chance  that you might find a shipwreck or buried treasure chest near or on the island you are on. If this happens, you can consider yourself quite lucky indeed as a shipwreck effectively solves all of the above three points (Crafting, Food and Shelter): the hull can be broken up and dismantled for wood, the ship often contains chests that oftentimes have food in them and the ship itself can be converted into an impromptu improvised house for surviving the initial nights. The shipwreck is also likely to contain a map that shows the path to a Buried Treasure Chest.

Craft shears and use it to collect some seagrass, then breed turtles, which spawn on the beach. They lay turtle eggs; make sure to protect them as the undead, stray wolves, and cats try to break it. When these eggs hatch, make sure to not let those baby turtles get to the ocean before growing up. The recommended strategy is to fence them in (during their egg stages). Now protect the baby turtles from zombies and skeletons. When those turtles grow, they drop scutes, an item used to craft turtle shells, which is a useful helmet because it has the same protection as iron, lasts longer than iron, and allows you to breathe underwater longer.

Finding a buried treasure chest on the island can be a boon for survival, because the chest often contains treasure such like iron and gold ingots, various types of fish, (in rare cases) iron swords and leather tunics ‌[Java Edition  only], cake, TNT, potion of water breathing or regeneration, and chain armor‌[Bedrock Edition  only]. Buried treasure chests are also guaranteed to contain a single heart of the sea item, which is used alongside 8 nautilus shells to craft a conduit. Nautilus shells are drops from the drowned, which are underwater zombie variants. They can also be caught as treasure from fishing. Buried Treasure is much rarer than shipwrecks and are also much harder to find, as they consist of only one block. However, if you find one (and are able to craft the conduit), you need to find some prismarine, dark prismarine, prismarine bricks or sea lanterns (all of which are found in ocean monuments), and you could construct yourself a conduit and live underwater.

Underwater Ruins are another rare structure that has the potential to greatly benefit a player's survival game. They generate mostly underwater, although if you are lucky enough to find one that generated on land, you effectively have a half-done house. As an added bonus, underwater ruins also contain chests with loot and treasure. If you have access to a conduit, you could use an underwater ruin as a base. Beware, however, as underwater ruins may potentially be inhabited by drowned which can, in the worst-case scenario, spawn with tridents, granting them a lethal ranged attack. Drowned are extremely dangerous underwater because they have no distraction from a limited breath meter.

If your island is near or next to a warm ocean, you could see a coral reef which can be visible at night with sea pickles as a light source. Kelp does not generate in this biome and pufferfish may poison you when you get close to them.

Wandering trader spawn on the same island you are on (typically in the water). In island survival, however, because you likely have no emeralds, you can kill the trader for its leads and its llamas. If you have found emeralds from shipwrecks or treasure chests, ruins, or mineshaft chests, you can purchase some useful things from the wandering trader. There is no penalty for killing one, and another eventually appears afterward.

Besides beach and forest biomes, the plains biome likely exists on the island you live on. Even though you live on an isolated island, an illager patrol could still spawn on your island; watch out if you see them. If your island is small, the illagers sometimes spawn in the water, and you can easily pick them off with a bow and arrow, then swim out to collect their loot.

## Exploring
Once you have managed to set up a stable and reliable food- and tree farm and secured your basic necessities (housing and sleeping arrangements in some form), you can now begin to look outward and get on the business of exploring the greater world around you.

Start by making sure you have the materials shown above (a boat, food, weapons and tools, torches, and other necessary building blocks). Now, you can place the boat and start traveling away from the island. Be careful near underwater ravines, as bubble columns from magma blocks give you oxygen, but these blocks may also break your boat and pull you down underwater.

You can also travel the ocean by swimming instead of using a boat. Swimming near a dolphin speeds up your swimming, and also you can dive to see if there is a ruin or shipwreck at the ocean floor. You can also explore underwater caverns, but Water Breathing is required for exploring.

While exploring the ocean, there is also a chance you might find a monument, where guardians and prismarine can be found, which is useful for your conduit. See Tutorials/Defeating a monument for more. Once the island is out of sight, you can start searching for other islands or the mainland.

### Beaches
If you find a beach, try looking for sugar cane. If you find some, harvest it and then return to the home island and craft the sugar cane into paper, then a map (but save some sugarcane so you can farm it to get more). Then, travel in the same direction with your map, this time bringing a lead. Use the lead to bring animals to the home island.

While you are filling your map, be sure to stop by any islands you see, as they may house generated structures underneath them.
