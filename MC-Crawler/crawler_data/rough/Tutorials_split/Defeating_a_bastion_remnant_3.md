### Magma cubes
Magma cubes can come from spawners hanging from chains over lava. They are very hard to reach and the cubes can knock you into lava. Although breaking these spawners works and protects you, the problem is that you can no longer use them for magma cream farms. Here is a list of some strategies:

- Attack the big magma cubes first. This is because they have high health, do heavy damage, and jump high enough to knock players off 3-block tall pillars. The other magma cubes are much less dangerous, and can easily be killed in one hit with a decent weapon from atop a 3-block tall pillar, and the smallest ones can be killed with just your fist.
- Summoning iron golems is almost a perfect solution. Because they are immune to magma cube damage (knockback too), and deal massive damage, this is a good approach. But one problem:Lava.  The area where magma cube spawners exist is filled with lava, which iron golems avoid and take damage in.  Fortunately, this can be mitigated with asplash(orlingering)potion of Fire Resistance.
- If you don't have those kinds of resources, consider shooting them from afar. You should be far enough away to kill all of them before they make their way to you.
- You can fill in their lava pool piecemeal, making the area much safer.  A potion of fire resistance can also help.

### Magma cube spawner disabling
Using 9 solid blocks, the magma cube spawner can be completely disabled.
What a disabled spawner looks like from below. Take note that the blocks are one block higher than the level of the spawner.
There is always a magma cube spawner in each bastion remnant of the treasure room type. It is located close to the bottom of the large room, above a lava pool, guarding the ultimate treasure: a pile of gold blocks, and a chest. Most players would just easily disable the spawner by breaking it, as magma cubes spawn at any light level, torches won't do anything, and it takes a lot of time and blocks to fill up the entire 9×3×9 spawning area, enough time for the local piglins, piglin brutes and magma cubes to tear you into pieces. However, there exist a simple way to disable a magma cube spawner entirely and reliably, using as little as 9 blocks.

This disabling grid makes use of the mechanic that a magma cube, no matter large, medium or small, checks for the space requirements of a large magma cube before it spawns. Since a large magma cube is slightly wider than 2 blocks, there is no horizontal space within the 9×3×9 area for it to fit in. Also, a spawner can only spawn a mob's "feet" at 3 heights: one block below the spawner, same height as the spawner, or one block above the spawner. No matter which layer it chooses, even the lowest layer, since a large magma cube is slightly taller than 2 blocks, its "head" will slightly intersect with at least one of the solid blocks, cancelling the spawn attempt.

## Defeating the bastion
General

Regardless of what part of the bastion you're trying to explore, it's a good idea to start exploring from the top and work your way down. Piglins won't hesitate to take fall damage to get to you, which can easily result in you getting ambushed if you start exploring from the bottom. A piglin brute landing on top of you is especially deadly, as they can disable your shield, leaving you completely vulnerable to their high damage attacks. Because of this, it is highly recommended to bring at least one totem of undying to a bastion remnant.

Getting to the top can be treacherous though; building to the top carries the risk of being shot off by a crossbow-wielding piglin (If you've angered them or aren't wearing gold armor) or a ghast, which can cause you to fall to your death or into lava. Digging through nearby netherrack to the top avoids these threats, but can result in you digging into a lava pocket and getting yourself melted. A potion of Slow Falling can help protect you from the dangers of building up to the top and a potion of Fire Resistance will keep you safe from any lava pockets you dig/fall into.

Once you have reached the top of the bastion, it is highly recommended to secure a respawn area, set a respawn anchor and lay a nearby chest or hopper with a supply of glowstone, should you need multiple respawn attempts. If you die in the bastion, getting your items back will be extremely difficult since piglins can be very tough without armor, and will steal your armor leaving you unable to get it back. Because of this, it is also worth having a chest with back-up armor so you can safely retrieve your stuff without being instantly killed again by piglins and piglin brutes.

Because the bastion remnant is almost completely made of blackstone, navigation can become difficult as the monochrome makes it hard to spot un-explored stairs or corridors. Marking your path (especially where you entered the bastion) with torches or brighter blocks like cobblestone can help you can see where you've already been. The ruined pathing of the bastion also means you should have a good supply of blocks to fill in the holes in the paths so you don't fall through them.

Remember that all nearby piglins will become hostile if you attack a piglin brute, even if you're wearing gold armor. Most of the time, this makes it a better idea to avoid or trap brutes instead of fight them. You can also pour lava on the brutes to kill them, since this does not count as player damage, other piglins will not become hostile. If they're guarding a chest or there's no practical way to avoid fighting them, it can be a good idea to take out the surrounding piglins first, especially the ones with crossbows, so that you can have an escape route ready if things don't go as planned. This also holds true for when you want to loot a chest or gold blocks, although you may not have to do this if there aren't any piglins around; they can only detect you doing this from up to 16 blocks away.

You'll likely find your inventory filling up easily, given how much loot and equipment bastion remnants can hold. Shulker boxes and an ender chest can greatly expand your maximum item capacity, but you can store the excess loot in chests that are already there if you're okay with making return trips. A furnace can also be used to smelt all the gold weapons and armor you'll come across into nuggets; just make sure to leave one piece of gold armor unsmelted so you can equip it in case the one you're wearing breaks while you're exploring. Enchanted items can be disenchanted for experience with a grindstone.

Specific Bastion Types

When exploring a hoglins stable, you should kill the hoglins first. They have more melee range than the piglins, are inherently hostile, and deal a lot of knockback, which can easily push you off the pillars and bridges of the bastion. Be careful not to hit any piglins while doing this; Hoglins are dangerous enough when fought by themselves.

When exploring a treasure room, after clearing out the areas above, you should fill in the surrounding lava and disable/close off the magma cube spawner. Gravel and sand can help you fill in the lava from above, as the lava pool is only 2 blocks deep with the exception of the occasional hole in the base of the bastion. A potion of Fire Resistance can save your life if a magma cube knocks you into the lava pool while you're trying to fill it. Note that because magma cubes spawn at all light levels, the only way to disable the spawner is to completely cover it with blocks in a ~9×5×9 area with the spawner being in the center, one block under the top of that area. It's usually more practical to wall off the 9×5×9 area they spawn in instead.
The entrance also has 4+ chests at, so make sure to loot those as well. You can loot one room, then mine into the left side (facing the entrance), and the second chest room will be on the other side.

When exploring a bridge, the gold statue is generally somewhat safe to mine. It is on a 3-block tall podium, so piglin brutes and piglins with swords are easy to kill. Crossbow piglins can knock you off, so prioritize killing them first with a ranger weapon. After killing the piglins that rushed to you, the bastion is somewhat safe in the center. Avoid melee combat, as it is easy to get pushed into lava. A Punch bow will help shove piglins and brutes into the lava columns. Turning left will bring you to another dangerous area, so snipe the piglins from afar. Make sure to block off all entrances when opening chests, as piglins will be aggravated, so you can take your time picking out the lodestone and other valuables in the chest. Afterwards, open a small hole if piglins are nearby trying to attack you. If none are there, the bastion is pretty much free to explore.
