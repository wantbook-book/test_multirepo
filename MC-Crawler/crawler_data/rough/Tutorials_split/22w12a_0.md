## Additions
### Items
** Spawn Eggs **
- Added warden spawn egg.

### Mobs
** Warden **
- The first fully blind mob.
	- Has a sense of smell. It can detect and pathfind toward the general location of a player or mob through a "smelling" action.
		- Prioritizes smelling the player or mob that it is most suspicious of, rather than the one closest to it.
	- Has a sense of vibration. When sensing movement, it pathfinds toward the source of the movement.
		- It follows and attacks players, mobs, and other entities that make vibrations.
		- When it detects a vibration, the growths on its head rattle and light up, similar to thesculk sensor.
			- If any projectile (e.g.egg,snowball,arrow) lands near it, the warden inspects the location where the projectile landed, due to the projectile creating significant vibrations. This feature can be used in order to cause a distraction.
		- Does not detect players that are sneaking.
	- Can detect players or mobs that have theInvisibilityeffect.
- Becomes more suspicious of a player or mob as it detects its location more through vibrations and/or smelling. When it suspects the target enough, it identifies its exact location, which aggravates it, causing it to pathfind toward the target to attack regardless of outside distractions.
- Spawns when a player activates sculk shriekers three times.
	- It is the only mob that spawns in the deep dark biome.
- "Emerges" from the ground when spawned bysculk shriekers.
	- Digs back into the ground when it doesn't sense any vibration after 60 seconds.
		- Like howname tagsprevent despawning, name tags can also prevent wardens from being able to burrow back to the ground.
		- Wardens will not dig back when they're in water.
- Has 500× 250health points and does 30× 15damage on Normal difficulty, bringing players wearing fullnetheritearmorfrom full health to 7health points.
- Is about 3.5 blocks tall, making it one of the tallest mobs in the game, exceeding theiron golemandendermanin height and width (the same).
	- Wardens have long melee reach, being able to hit the player when on top of a four block pillar, thus making it capable of countering certain cheese tactics, such as pillaring.
- Wardens disable shields when they hit the players with their fists.
- The warden doesn't qualify as a target for the advancement "Monster Hunter" and isn't needed to receive the advancement "Monsters Hunted" due to its role.
- Warden's chest has a glowing core that appears to brighten and dim in tandem with the Darkness effect.
	- The core creates a low throbbing or "heartbeat" sound as it pulses. The sound and animation speed up rapidly as the warden gets more suspicious of or closer to attacking a player or mob.
- Is immune tolavaand can float up lava columns very fast.
- Is immune to knockback and never slows down in water.
