This menu allows you to choose which game type to play as well as access Realms, the game Options, or quit the game.

### Singleplayer
Singleplayer Menu
The Singleplayer button, located at the top of the group of buttons on the main menu, leads you to the screen as shown at the right.

If you don't have any worlds, the game will direct you to the Create New World scene.

In the example at the right, there are two different worlds. Each world has its own section in the list, which contains the following information:
