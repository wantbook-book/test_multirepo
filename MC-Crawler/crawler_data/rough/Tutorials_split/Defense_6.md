### TNT Defenses
TNT, although dangerous and lag intensive, is very effective when killing mobs. Obsidian or self repairing land is useful in an area of little or no use to minimize damage. If you use more than 1 TNT, most drops will also be destroyed.

It can be useful to place the TNT trap above sand or gravel so that a player will be trapped with the charge and a mob won't be able to wander away.

#### TNT Cannons
TNT cannons are one of the best weapons to use. These should be put outside your perimeter. Go to Tutorials/TNT Cannons to find steps to build these.

#### TNT Self Destructing Systems
When you are on multiplayer server, and you don't want your enemies taking your loot. To prevent this, you can make TNT SDS (Self Destruct System) under your base. You need the following to build SDS:

- A lot ofTNT
- Plenty ofredstone
- Any block (It is recommended that you use a "junk block" likedirt.)
- Alever
- Redstone repeaters

To make a TNT SDS, first dig 3 blocks under your base. Fill it with TNT on 3 blocks under your base. On top of the TNTs, put your normal blocks. On top of that, fill the 3rd floor with redstone. Now put repeaters on the 3rd floor (right-bottom of the real base's floor) and make a road to where you want activator be. Put a lever in the activating zone, and connect your SDS to the lever lever using redstone and repeaters. When your base is in danger and lots of enemies in your base, take as much loot of yours as you can and run. When you are near the Activating Zone, you can now pull the lever and kill all the enemies. One SDS looks like this:         

|  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

Advantages:

- You can take some of your loot
- Can kill a lot of your enemies at once

Disadvantages:

- You will lose at least 90% of your base
- Takes time to build
- Will lose most of your loot

#### Land Mines
To create a land mine, you'll need:

- SomeTNT
- Pressure plates
- Any block exceptobsidianorbedrock

To make a landmine, you need to dig a two-block deep hole. At the bottom of this hole, place a single block of TNT. Next, place any block on top of the TNT. Lastly, place a pressure plate on top of the block that was placed on the TNT. Once an entity steps on the plate, the TNT will explode, thus causing damage to the entity and the terrain.

Advantages:

- Mobs are usually killed in one blast
- Landmines are relatively easy to make
- They can be triggered from a safe location withredstone

Disadvantages:

- Landmines must be recreated after each use
- The blast may set off other landmines
- You or your shelter could be destroyed
- Themobmay go past theTNTwhile chasing you
- In most cases, TNT is more valuable than the killing of a single hostile mob.

To prevent terrain or structures from being destroyed, place water on a side of the TNT. This trap will still damage mobs, but the surrounding blocks will not be destroyed. However, the trap won't be as effective. You can also put blocks that have tough blast resistance like obsidian around TNT landmine.

If you want to make sure that the mob is killed in the explosion and that your base won't blow up, dig a deep hole (break the block NEXT to the one that you're standing on). Jump in, then replace the bottom block(s) with obsidian and pillar back up. Break the blocks again, and put a TNT block two blocks down, followed by a gravity affected block (either sand or gravel). Finally, put a pressure plate on top.

#### Instant Land Mine
Regular land mines take a couple seconds to detonate, allowing players to run away from the blast. You could always add more TNT to make the blast too big to run away from, but that is a lot more expensive than an instant land mine, which explodes as soon as a player touches the pressure plate and can be made to do more damage than normally.

Tutorial

You will need the following to make one land mine:

- 1pressure plate(Preferably stone, as things such as drops from burning mobs can activate wooden pressure plates.)
- 1powered rail
- 2 or moreminecarts with TNT(If you use more than 2, the explosion will do more damage.)
- 1 block (Choose a block that matches the rest of the ground on which the mine will be made on/in.)
- 1rail(You will get it back once you are done.)

To make it, dig a 1Ã—1 hole 2 blocks deep where you want the mine the pressure plate to be located. At the bottom, put the powered rail on one of the blocks. Then, place the regular rail like this:

[] = Normal blocks
__ = Regular rail
== = Powered rail
++ = Pressure plate

     __
   [][]  [][]
   [][]==[][]
   [][][][][]

Place a minecart with TNT on the regular rail and push it off the ledge onto the powered rail. Repeat this with the other minecart(s) with TNT. Once you are done with that, remove the rail and a block next to the powered rail. The block you remove has to be one of the blocks that the powered rail is facing. When you are done, it will look like this:

   [][]  [][]
   [][]==  []
   [][][][][]

Next, replace the block above the powered rail (and minecarts with TNT) and put the pressure plate on it. The finished product is this:

       ++
   [][][][][]
   [][]==  []
   [][][][][]

When the pressure plate is pressed down, the powered rail will activate, moving the minecarts with TNT off the rail. They will then detonate, blowing the player into the sky. If the explosion does not kill the player, the fall into the newly formed crater will kill them, or if it doesn't it will severely damage them.

Advantages

- Instantly blows up, giving players no time to escape
- Deals lots of damage
- Easily concealable

Disadvantages

- Damages terrain
- Has a higher chance of detonating during construction than regular landmines
- Are more expensive than regular landmines
- Like all landmines, it can be easily noticed by a vigilant player
