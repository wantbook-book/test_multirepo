# Tutorials/Sugar Cane farming
Sugar cane is a valuable plant for crafting rockets, making books for bookshelves, maps, and trading paper. Sugar cane can also be used with a composter to get bone meal, however, melon farms are probably more suited for this. The large amount of sugar cane obtainable from some of these farms can make it much easier to get firework rockets or emeralds.

## Mechanics
Sugar cane can only be planted on grass block, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, podzol, mycelium, sand, red sand, moss block and mud. The block must be directly adjacent to water and not merely above or diagonal as with crops. If a plant's water source is removed, it breaks when it is next updated. In Bedrock Edition, the sugar cane is updated with its water, so it breaks immediately.

Every 16 random ticks, sugar cane grows 1 block in height, similar to how cactus, kelp, and bamboo grow. On average, sugar cane grows 1 block every 18 minutes. Sugar cane's growth rate is unaffected by the absence of light.

Sugar cane can naturally grow up to 3 blocks in height. This limit can be bypassed by placing additional plants on top of an existing one but it does not grow naturally any further.

Sugar cane, like saplings, wheat, and cacti, grows only if the chunk they are on is loaded into memory, so you should not venture too far from the field if you want it to grow. The growth range is based on simulation distance.

## Manual farm designs
This pattern is easier to harvest since the player doesn't fall into the water as often.
The first step in building a sugar cane farm is choosing a design. When starting out, simply placing sugar cane on a river bank should be sufficient. However, this quickly becomes impractical when implemented on a large scale. Sugar cane farms must balance between compactness, ease of harvest, and difficulty to build.

A double rowed design, while not the most efficient of designs as it has only 2 canes per water, is relatively easy to build and harvest. It is also a good choice for some of the semi-automatic designs below. With this design, it is recommended to use flowing water rather than water sources. Not only is it easier to build it flowing, but when harvesting, any items that fall into the water flow into a central location.

This compact pattern allows planting four sugar cane per water block.
A more efficient grid pattern design can also be used. This design has 4 sugar canes per water source, so it is highly compact. Placing lily pads or something similar on top of all water blocks makes the ground smooth and easy for the player to walk on without falling. Light blocks can be used under or above the water to prevent mob spawning. Slabs or trapdoors can be placed as waterlogged blocks in the upper half of the water sources instead of lily pads without interfering with their ability to sustain plant growth.

When harvesting, walk slowly and sweep side to side breaking all but the bottom block of each sugar cane. Then, pick up any missed items and continue. Watch out for creepers camouflaged among the plants.

## Semi automatic farm designs
In Bedrock Edition, when sugar cane's water source is removed, it immediately breaks. Using this principle, it is easy to create semi-automatic farms that harvest the sugar cane. These designs should still work in Java Edition, however, it takes a bit more time for the sugar cane to break. Some other designs here are classified as semi-automatic due to their lack of ability to pick up the sugar cane. These can often be easily converted into automatic designs as seen in the next section.

### Water canal design
Build the double rowed design as shown in the manual farms list. Then, place dispensers containing water buckets to control the water flow. Removing the water streams with the dispensers should cause the sugar cane to break so the player can pick them up and replant.

### Piston harvester

This design uses pistons to harvest the sugar cane. If the sugar cane is only two blocks tall, it can all be pushed into a water stream. However, if it grows any taller, the top blocks may fall down to the sand where the player can pick it up. This design is often used as the basis for fully automatic farms, however, it must be modified to push the top blocks as well or some of the sugar cane may be lost.

### Bone meal design

In Bedrock Edition, bone meal can be used to instantly grow sugar cane to maximum height. This mechanic can be used to create automatic sugar cane farms.

In the shown design, the dispenser can be filled with bone meal to constantly grow the sugar cane. Since bone meal is not used up on fully grown sugar cane, none is wasted. The player can then stand and constantly break the middle block of sugar cane to quickly farm large quantities.

It is not difficult to connect this with a piston to make it more automatic. However, since pistons cannot push and retract as quickly as the observer clock, it may be desirable to use a different redstone clock. Additionally, a single hopper may not be able to keep up with the large amount of sugar cane, so multiple hoppers or a slower clock should be used. Ideally, a 4 gametick delay clock should be used instead of an observer clock. Even more ideal is a 2 gametick alternating dispenser bone meal system with a ravager in a minecart to break the top 2 sugarcane blocks.
