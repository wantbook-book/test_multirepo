#### Layout 5
Room and fork layout

1. Dig a room that is 7 blocks long, 10 blocks wide and 3 blocks high. Have their stairway or ladder in the middle of one of the 10 block walls, preferably 2 spaces wide.
2. Starting in one of the corners, dig parallel to one of the walls of the room the player just dug for 20 spaces, and place a torch every 5 blocks.
3. Then, dig another 20 block tunnel that has two blocks between it and the previous tunnel.
4. Continue until the player reaches the other side of the room.

By utilizing this variant properly, players can uncover all the blocks in quite a large area, and the mineral yields are quite high. Having the stairs 2 blocks wide allows for thorough strip mining as they can be strip mined around. Also, a good length for each tunnel is 20 blocks long.

Branch mining with "pokeholes".

A branch mine with pokeholes is a variation on a traditional branch mine, but designed to have a better blocks-revealed to blocks-mined ratio. Like a traditional branch mine, branch mines with pokeholes have several parallel 2×1 shafts that branch out of a main trunk shaft. However, they are much further apart than in a branch mine (11 blocks as opposed to 3). The reason for this is that as player dig the 2×1 shafts, every 4th block forward they have go, they dig a 1×1 hole to the left and the right, revealing many previously hidden blocks. This technique used to be called "feather mining", but after xisumavoid's video covering this method, it's more commonly known as "branch mining with poke holes", or simply "pokehole mining". The mine got its old name from its feather-like shape when viewed in a cave map or with an x-ray resource pack.

### Tiered Branch Mining
Advanced branch mining is one of the most efficient way to mine 100% of the ores on multiple levels.
This setup allows for linear navigation along tunnels by first selecting depth, then choosing an appropriate tunnel at that depth.
Tiered branch mining is the art of stacking shaft mines on top of one another.

If the player decide to stack their mineshafts, however, they should use an odd-spacing, or they will get inefficiency and blind spots.

For instance, the following tiering has the advantage of being very thorough, while finding any 2×2×2 cube of valuable ore. It has the disadvantage of missing some of the smaller blobs, though it doesn't miss as many as players might expect it yields somewhere between 80 and 90% of the ores in a region.

(x=branch, o=stone)

This is a good mine for single player if the player can't stand the mere possibility of leaving 2×2×2 cube of diamonds just below or above their initial mineshaft and this will find them.

The next one has a tiering distance of 3, and is noticeably less thorough, but it finds at least 90% of the diamonds in a chunk:

oooxoooxoooxo
oooxoooxoooxo
ooooooooooooo
oxoooxoooxooo
oxoooxoooxooo
ooooooooooooo
oooxoooxoooxo
oooxoooxoooxo
ooooooooooooo
oxoooxoooxooo
oxoooxoooxooo
(bedrock begins)

This is a good mine for somewhat crowded multiplayer, where thoroughness is actually worth something.

Should the player be willing to sacrifice efficiency in exchange for revealing every last block, players can use a tiering distance of 2:

oooxoooxoooxo
oooxoooxoooxo
oxoooxoooxooo
oxoooxoooxooo
oooxoooxoooxo
oooxoooxoooxo
oxoooxoooxooo
oxoooxoooxooo

This particular tiering, however, is not only inefficient, but requires one of the access methods shown in the pictures-either an 8 tall, 2-3 wide tunnel with staircases as shown in the gray picture, or with one access shaft for 2 sets of layers. This should be used only in ridiculously crowded multiplayer servers, when what matters is finding that one redstone blob that got missed by all the random-miners.

However, nearly any spacing and layout can be used with a given tiering distance, as it is fairly thorough, only slightly less efficient than a straight shaft, and it can be transformed into nearly any level of thoroughness without wasting effort.

Nearly any layout, spacing, and branch-length can be combined with any tiering distance, though doing it with a phoenix mine on the compact spacing is not recommend for anyone who gets headaches easily.

### Windmill mining
Windmill mining is an efficient mining technique invented by a Japanese Minecrafter てりぃ (pronounced like Terry).

Pros: 

1. Players don't need to count a large number of blocks.
2. Players won't get lost in their own labyrinth.
3. Players can easily predict biomes that they are going to mine. If they want to mineemeralds, just choose the center ofmountainsfor their start point.
4. It is relatively easy to suspend and resume mining.
5. It has the same efficiency as 3 space branch mining.
