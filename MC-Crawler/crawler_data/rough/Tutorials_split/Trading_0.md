## Notes
Before you proceed, here are some things you'll have to do:

For a villager to offer useful items, you must level it up by trading. The ideal trades to do this are listed below, but as a rule of thumb, selling items for emeralds increases a villager's experience more than buying items, and later trades offer more experience.

The items that villagers offer are random. If you get offers you don't want, you should either break and replace the job site block if you haven't traded with the villager yet, or you need a way to efficiently kill off villagers without lowering popularity. The best way to do this is by digging a 1Ã—1 hole that is 3 blocks deep, and then use either lava or enough gravel or sand to kill them. You can also use magma blocks, campfires, and flint & steel to do the same thing. You can use zombies and husks to kill them, but they can be used for zombie discounts.

## Uses of each profession
### Armorer
This profession is a must, as it allows you to obtain chain and diamond armor easily. In addition, you can buy bells if you plan on starting a new village. The best way to level it up is using iron. Iron is not too hard to get in large quantities after a large mining session, and it offers decent XP. Diamonds and lava buckets are too hard to obtain in large quantities to be ideal. In Java Edition, one villager is enough to provide a full set of diamond armor, while in Bedrock Edition, at least two villagers are needed.

Armorers are also the only reliable source of renewable diamond armor, as the only other way is to kill extremely rare zombies and skeletons that spawn with diamond armor. The diamond armor is enchanted upon purchase, but can be easily disenchanted using grindstone if the player wishes to add better enchantments.

### Butcher
This profession does not sell anything other than food. However, it is useful to sell raw meat if the player has an efficient animal farm. Chickens and hoglins can be farmed fully automatically, meaning raw chicken and raw porkchops can be sold to butchers in large quantities. Sweet berries and dried kelp blocks can also be easily farmed and sold to obtain emeralds.

Butchers can provide a good source of cooked food. Cooked Porkchop is the most nutritious. 

### Cartographer
The main reason to have a cartographer is to obtain explorer maps for ocean monuments or woodland mansions, in addition to unique banner patterns. Paper is sufficient to level it up, but if you have lots of sand, glass panes work fine, too. Once you have purchased the maps, the villager is still relatively useful, as paper can be continuously sold to it, as long as the player's sugar cane farm productivity is high enough.

### Cleric
This profession is mainly useful for purchasing ender pearls, as well as bottles o' enchanting to raise your experience level, or as a portable experience storage. In addition, it allows you to trade away rotten flesh that has probably been either accumulating in your chests or thrown out. It is a little hard to level up, as aside from the flesh, it buys hard to obtain items, but this profession is still useful nonetheless. They are also one of the only renewable sources of lapis lazuli, but a 1:1 ratio of exchange makes it highly expensive. 

### Farmer
The main use of this profession is to obtain emeralds by trading away crops, as well as buying golden carrots and glistering melon slices without having to craft them using gold. It is recommended to sell pumpkins, as these grow fast and are easy to mass farm. However, level them up with the melon trade, as it gives twice as much experience to the villager than the pumpkin trade.

The golden carrots obtained from these villagers can serve as a staple food for the player, thanks to their high nutritional value. The player can also buy cakes and apples relatively easily from them, so they do not need to craft the cakes manually, or chop down hundreds of oak trees for apples.
