### Drawbridge
Using trapdoors, some redstone, and switches, a simple drawbridge can be made. Dig a moat around your base and make sure it is too long to jump across. Now, make short walls next to your entrance. Depending on whether you have a single door or double door, you have to use one row or two rows of trapdoors respectively. Run redstone next to the trapdoors and connect them to switches inside your base, then cover up the redstone walls. This prevents mobs from getting close to your door while you are inside your base, but the bridge has to be left open while outside your base, otherwise you'll have to find another way back in. Alternatively, you can make a T Flip-Flop gate and place another switch outside your house to trigger the drawbridge from anywhere.

### Sticky piston drawbridge

Inaccessible

It is possible to make a drawbridge using sticky pistons that is difficult for a mob to cross. This draw bridge also involves the use of a moat or lake. A knowledge of redstone logic gates and how power is supplied to blocks is needed as the mechanism uses multiple redstone repeaters, NOT Gates and a T-Flip Flop. Using the T-Flip Flop one can wire the drawbridge so that it becomes accessible or inaccessible with the touch of a button from either side of the bridge. When the player(s) wants to cross the button is pressed causing both ends of the drawbridge and the center to be even allowing the player(s) to cross. When activated to keep mobs out both ends of the drawbridge are raised 1 block higher than the water level making it impossible to jump from the water to dry land and the center blocks are lowered 1 below the water level causing the center area to flood. Assuming both areas are properly lit and secured this creates an impassable entrance to one's base.

### Secure waterfront
Because zombies and skeletons can survive sunlight in water and hostile mobs can swim, if you have a base on the coast it's a good idea to make sure it isn't vulnerable to mob attack. Additionally, drowned pose a threat in the water. Building canals, lighting nearby islands, and building walls on areas of water you don't use can stop rare, but still as deadly, attacks from the sea.

### Land mines
If you like to blow up stuff, you might like this. All you need is a lot of pressure plates (wood) and TNT. Once you found your spot dig two blocks down. Then place the TNT then another block, then the place the pressure plate. You can have a big mine field but usually more effort than it's worth.

### TNT cannon
TNT cannons are a good destructive way to take out mobs. Make a TNT cannon (a chaos cannon is also nice) and have a chest full of TNT. For more detail go to Tutorials/TNT cannons.

### Iron golem trap
If you have a lot of iron, you can create a separate room containing multiple iron golems. This can be opened via a piston door to allow iron golems into a courtyard or garden. This allows them to be sent to kill zombies if your house is under siege.

### Cactus wall
If you have a small house near or in the desert, and you want some more protection because you're just starting out, or if you're a veteran and you want a cheap, effective wall, then this is the wall for you. It's basically composed of cactus blocks, placed about 3 blocks high, and all around your base in a way like this:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

and only make one path to your door, this trips up most mobs, other than skeletons because they shoot, and spiders, and they tend to jump over it, but it's an excellent defense for a beginner.

### Snow golem sentry
Place a snow golem in a small booth and give it a hole to throw snowballs at mobs through. Elevate the golem so that creepers can't blow it up and zombies can't hit it.

### Outer walls
The best material to construct these are stone, stone brick or brick. Obsidian is harder to obtain but a lot better than stone-based blocks. They should be at least 4 blocks high and 2 iron doors for the exit. Make sure to build ramparts and cover walls, and fill with lava/water. Also have a 1×1×1 moat of lava/water with a torch in front like this:

|  |  |  |
|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |

### Weaponry room
This is a room you can solely use to make weapons and store them. You'll want a crafting table and some chests for materials. This is useful since you can then use your original crafting room for things other than weapons, therefore leaving more space for such. Some holes in the side would be useful for sniping all the mobs and creepers outside.

### Blacksmith
This room is where you can put your anvils and grindstones and some chests with tool making materials (eg.iron ingots,sticks,wood). Also put a good bit of furnaces, for all your mined ores to be smelted. This can also be used for good looks if you do it right.
### Alarm tower
This can be used to signal if enemies are near your base. Using the command block, you could make it so a message gets sent out when you pull a lever or press a button, and could also turn on a source of lighting so people can see the signal from far away. Can be fun on single player or LAN, but it is also quite useful for multiplayer.

### Drop trap
This is useful for those short corridors from one part of your building to the other, as when you pull a lever at one side of the corridor, the floor would open making enemies fall down who are chasing you. Easy to make, all you need are a couple of sticky pistons and redstone, and optional lava, then you're set!
