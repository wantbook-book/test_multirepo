Alt+F4 is patched, but using Task Manager to end the task, on the other hand, is NOT patched, and still works. This is very similar to the Alt+F4 method.
Steps:

1. Open task manager
2. Go into the world you want to dupe the items in
3. Make sure 'Pause on Lost Focus' is off. Do this by pressing F3+P until you see something like "[Debug] Pause on lost focus: disabled" in chat
4. Put the items that you would like to dupe in your inventory
5. Close the world and open it up again
6. When it loads drop the items on ground by pressing 'Q' on the item. Don't close your inventory.
7. Quickly press ALT+TAB or  CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to get into Task Manager
8. End the process "Java(TM) Platform SE Binary" or "OpenJDK Platform Binary"
9. Open Minecraft and load the world again
10. Collect your items

From testing, it doesn't always work. Try playing with different timings.

This duplication glitch works on 1.16.5 multiplayer. It requires an elytra and firework rockets that deal damage to the player. If the rockets do not damage the player, the duplication will not work. Video below: (duplication glitch starts at 0:33)




This is known to work in vanilla servers and realms, however Spigot has patched the bug and Paper has patched it long before its discovery.

##### Dirt Duplication

The mechanism for growing giant spruce trees is known to be glitched in JE 1.16 snapshot. Instead of growing a giant tree on the saplings, the game grows the tree on the first position where space is sufficient and a dirt block is present in the north-west position. When the tree is grown, all the dirt blocks are filled in. With bone meal and piston automation, a semi-auto dirt duplicator can be produced (YouTube by ilmango).

Bring an animal to the end, put a lead on it, and then lead it into the end portal. When you get back, it should have dropped two leads. Sometimes one of the leads ends up in the end, so make sure to check there. It may not always be in the end, though. This also works when bringing animals into the nether.

##### Book player-profile rollback glitch

|--------------------|--------------|
| ? - 1.18?          | ?            |

This duplication glitch works on Singleplayer and Multiplayer. All you have to do is place a chest in front of you and then leave the server as it saves your player data, then relog and put the items you want to dupe from your inventory in the chest, get a book and quill, overload the book with excessive characters and it will cause you to get kicked from the server and rolling back your player data to last save while server files stay the same. As a result, the items will be in both your inventory and the chest.

The book mod (requires fabric download and custom download to work) automates the process.

Carpets can be duplicated using a contraption made of two Slime Blocks, a Sticky Piston, and an Observer. This glitch gives infinite fuel and is very easy to automate give thousands of carpets per hour tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezM2Hs_-hbE

Whenever the dragon lands on the end portal and releases the purple fog, be above or below the purple fog, look at the fog at a steep angle, and proceed to harvest the dragon's breath. The fog will first shrink as intended, but after it reaches the smallest size, it will expand with each bottle used, and keep expanding until the fog disappears as too much time passed.

##### Shulker Box breaking glitch

| ?                  | Spigot, Paper |

Shulker Box dupe allows you to duplicate any item in Minecraft singleplayer or Realms. This glitch works with 2 players or with an auto mine mod. So you quickly spam your item in and out while it being broken. The key is to take the item out just before the shulker box breaks. This may take a few tries but eventually you will dupe your items.

You can also use autoclicker with these settings: time between clicks- 1sec 487milisecs. Then you bind the autoclicker to key n, and automine to key m and press n,m,right click at the same time. This opens shulker. Hover over item you want to duplicate; shulkerbox should break and item in it, and item on the ground.

##### Piston-based TNT Duplication

TNT duplication works in a similar way as rail duplication. A TNT block is BUD-powered, such that when the contraption is pushed by a piston, the TNT is updated and ignites into a primed TNT entity. Then, the piston moves the TNT from the list of TNT block left. This doesn't so much duplicate the TNT block as it creates free primed TNT entities from it without deleting it. Many TNT duplicators still work, but unless properly constructed will blow themselves up.

One common TNT duplication design uses a minecart on a detector rail to power the slime block it is placed on, and moves a TNT block next to a coral fan underneath, the combination of the TNT and the coral duplicates the TNT whenever the whole contraption is moved forward with a piston. For an indepth tutorial of this one checkout Cheesysponges video https://youtu.be/3Izrj2m6Li4





































Slice 1




































Slice 2
The second slice may be placed on either side, and the coral fan has been marked with vines. To prime the mechanism, the upper slime blocks must first be moved forward, pushing the TNT under the rail. After this, moving the whole assemblage forward with a piston will duplicate the TNT, spawning a lit TNT entity directly below the TNT block.

For a list of variations, see e.g. [1]. TNT duping as a glitch is notable in that it has been patched by Mojang Studios several times in the past but was ultimately allowed in the vanilla game due to its immense value to the technical community. In the words of Mikael Hedberg, "TNT dupers fill a slot in the game that the intended game mechanics still cannot."
