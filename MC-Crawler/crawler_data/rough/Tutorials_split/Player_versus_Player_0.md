# Tutorials/Player versus Player
Player versus player, also known as PvP, refers to combat in Minecraft which involves players fighting other players in multiplayer. Whether fighting in teams or in one-on-one duels, this is a difficult skill to hone for many players.

This guide covers PvP in vanilla Minecraft, though it will acknowledge well-known server plugins.

## Important terms to remember
- Sprint Resetting: Ending and restarting your sprint after each KB hit to deal maximum KB.
- S-Tapping: After KB hitting your enemy, immediately press S to create some space between you and your foe
- Crit-chaining: Also known as crit spamming or critting out. It's the act of critting out an enemy multiple times without stopping.
- Jump Resetting: Jumping at the same time as getting hit, reducing the horizontal knockback you take significantly.
- Combo: A combo is done when you hit somebody 2 or more times without them being able to hit you back. There are many ways to do and hold a combo, but the most common and easiest way is by S-Tapping.
- Hit Selecting: KB hitting someone right after you get hit. Doing this reduces your horizontal velocity, reducing the knockback you take.
- Range Sense: A skill that takes time to learn. Its the ability to hit someone just at the edge of your 3 block range.
- Punish crit/P-crit/Revenge crit/counter crit: Critting your opponent after being hit by them, hitting them while falling after taking knockback from their hit. Very useful as you do not have to jump.
- Quickdrop/Dropping: Dying early in a fight due to a failure to heal yourself. Always to be avoided in PVP.
- Toteming: Offhanding a totem so that it pops and saves you from fatal moments. Only present in Crystal, SMP and Neth Pot.

## PVP Kits
- Axe and Shield PVP: A style of PVP where the main weapons used are axe. Kit includes a full unenchanted diamond armor, diamond axe and sword, 6 arrows, crossbow and bow, and a shield.
- Crystal PVP: A style of PVP that mainly uses end crystals and respawn anchors, and many totems of undying. Is much different from other PVP kits, barely using conventional weapons at all.
- Sword PVP: A style of PVP that uses only diamond armor and a diamond sword. Very reliant on quickness with PVP techniques and knowledge of maneuvers.
- Diamond Potion / Dia Pot: A kit with fully maxed out diamond armor, cooked beef, a fully maxed out sword without Fire Aspect II and a lot of Instant Health II, Strength II, Speed II and Regeneration II potions. It plays similarly to sword but mechanically very intensive and fast, as players mostly rely on using Healing Potions quickly to stay alive. LOKA is a special variant of Dia Pot featuring a 33% damage buff to all players, making fights a lot faster and more intense.
- Netherite Potion / Nethpot: A kit of PVP that has fully maxed netherite armor and sword, 64 golden apples, 2 stacks of XP bottles and a lot of Instant Health II, Strength and Speed II potions and Fire Resistance potions (8 minutes). Unlike Diamond Sword and Potion, this kit heavily relies on critting out your opponent.
- SMP Kit: A kit usually used in most SMPs where crystal PVP is illegal. It's similar to Netherite Pot but has ender pearls, 2 swords (one enchanted with KB 1) and healing pots are discarded. A shield and axe are also included in the kit and is more of a mix between Neth pot and UHC.
- UHC: A unique kit without natural regeneration. Players are armed with partially enchanted diamond armor, sword and axe, a few stacks of building blocks (usually cobblestone or planks), cobwebs, a few water and lava buckets, 13 golden apples, a bow and piercing crossbow (with arrows of course).

## Overview
PvP in Minecraft results in the death or injury of one or more players. When a player dies in normal difficulty, the contents of their inventory are scattered on the ground. This creates a powerful incentive for players to participate in PvP, as successfully killing another player rewards the killer with all of their items, and sometimes reputation and power too.

PvP can occur on any server where the admin has not set rules on it, or has allowed it. As some servers endorse building and adventuring cooperatively, while others are PvP-oriented, servers will usually have rules which dictate whether or not PvP is allowed. 

One such rule may be only allowing PvP in "war zones", which are designated areas of land wherein players are allowed to engage in combat. It is impossible for players to damage other players outside of these war zones. This type of rule may be in place to give players a safe area to restock on items or simply take a break from PvP.
