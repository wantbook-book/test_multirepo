### Hotbar
If you have thumb buttons, assign them to your weapon and water bucket. If a bucket is not available or you are in the Nether, equip a solid block instead. If you do not have a shield, it is best to put torches or food in your off-hand, as they can be used while having an equipped sword.

- Sword. Use the best material available and discard damaged/weaker swords.
- Axe/Shovel. An axe can shorten lumber trips and save daylight. One can be used as a weapon if your sword breaks. Shovels are unnecessary unless the player is doing lots of digging.
- Bow. Conserve ammo and only use it on witches, skeletons and creepers. Skeleton arrows can be avoided by building a 2-block dirt pillar and hiding behind it.
- Pickaxe. Indispensable in cave systems or the Nether. Use an iron or diamond pickaxe if available. Can be used as a weapon in a pinch.
- Water bucket. They can extinguish you, prevent fall damage, let you safely travel down mountains or save you from an enderman.
- Fire Resistancepotion.  It can be a life-saver if you are mining or exploring near lava in the Nether.
- Torches. Handy when exploring cave systems. Place them on the right walls when going deeper so you can remember how to exit.
- Dirt. Common, can be broken without tools and does not obey gravity. Can be used to scale walls, build bridges, create quick shelters, stop skeleton arrows or prevent endermen from reaching you.
- Steak. As plentiful and effective ascooked porkchops, but killing cows also gives youleather. Keep your hunger bar full whenever your health is not full.Golden applescan be used for dangerous situations.
- Healing items. Items likegolden applesandenchanted golden apples, along with potions can save your life when fighting mobs or trying to swim out of lava.
- Spyglass. Spyglasses allow you to zoom in on your surroundings, which can be helpful for spotting a dangerous mob or a useful structure.
- (Offhand)Shield. They can block Skeleton's arrows from pushing you and reduce damage from attacks. It is best to have it in your offhand so you are able to attack and defend easier than without.
- (Offhand)Totem of Undying. They can help you cheat death. Extremely useful. With them, you can save your world.

## Step by Step Guide to Hardcore
### Above-ground Preparations
Duration: 5–20 minutes

- Find the closest tree and punch it. Gather only 4 logs to save time.
- Craft acrafting table.
- Craft a wooden pickaxe.
- Find the neareststoneand mine 9 blocks to start. If there is no stone nearby, dig an angle shaft into the ground to reach stone.
- Craft a stone axe, stone pickaxe, stone shovel and stone sword.
- Get about half a stack of logs.
- Killpigs, cows, and sheep to get at least 12 pieces of meat. Grabmushroomsif you see any. Having food now is worth the effort it takes to find more animals later.
- Since it is safer to skip the nights early on, try to kill enoughsheepto craft abed.
- If you do not have a bed to skip the night, do somebranch miningunder your shelter so you can get iron.
- Start looking for acavesystem, although it's best not to explore a cave or ravine this early on.
- Don't make any stops. It is safer to wander around during the day with at least iron armor.

### Firm Footing
Duration: 15–60 minutes

At this point, either find a cave or create a mine (such as a branched mine). While it is usually safer to create a mine, using existing caves is often quicker.
While descending to the depths, avoid risks. At first, it may be dark so watch carefully for monsters and ores. Be sure to light everything in reach, and don't get lost. It is often helpful to use signs or another distinguishable block to mark the path. Right-hand rule for torches is recommended.

Coal is the first resource to find. Since inventory management can become a problem, try to keep a stack of coal as close to 64 as possible, but not above it, while keeping a similar number of torches in hand. If necessary, craft blocks of coal to store extra.

The next important resource is iron. 64 ingots is probably enough; piling up stacks and stacks is not necessary except for longer games. When equipment is nearly used up, or you just have enough iron, find a safe area(preferably beautiful) and set up a few furnaces to smelt/cook items quickly. Make, in this order: an iron sword, a shield, a pair of buckets (filling one with water), iron armor, an iron pickaxe, and an iron shovel. Also, toss any wood tools and store your stone tools.

Once fully equipped, go further down and collect diamonds. Only seven are necessary, although more is better (2 for a sword, 3 for a pickaxe and 2 for an enchanting table. These and full armor total up to 31 diamonds.) Use the diamond pickaxe to mine at least 14 pieces of obsidian for a Nether portal and an enchantment table (4 are enough if the player builds the portal using a bucket).

In the meantime, try and avoid lush caves and dripstone caves. They do not offer many useful items that cannot already be found in regular caves, and are usually dangerous to explore without the help of advanced gear.

It is hard to have too much gold because it is good for making golden apples, and netherite ingots. 8 ingots are required for a normal golden apple, and since the 1.9 update, enchanted golden apples aren't craftable. Be sure to grab some redstone for brewing potions.
Lapis lazuli is required to make enchantments, so don't forget to mine it if you find some.

The 1.17 update introduces a new item called a spyglass. If you can find an amethyst geode, grab some amethyst, gather some copper, and make a spyglass. This simple but useful investment allows you to zoom in on your surroundings, which is a useful ability.

This sums up all mining you need to do in the Hardcore mode. If you gathered, at any point, enough string to make a bow, do not hesitate to craft it and use it with whatever arrows skeletons dropped. If you come across a mineshaft, be careful. Avoid cave spider spawners, but loot any chests.

When you get home, make an infinite water spring, then build farms for wheat, carrots and perhaps potatoes. If you've gotten seeds for pumpkins, cocoa beans, and/or melons, farm those too. Sugar cane is very important (for bookshelves), so spread and harvest up to 3 stacks of that.

Wheat, seeds, and carrots can be used to lure and breed animals, leading to large supplies of meat and resources over time, so it is worthwhile. You need chickens (arrows) and cows (bookshelves). It is a good idea to tame cats to repel creepers, and wolves to fight.

Many resources (including bookshelves and enchanted diamond gear) can be gathered by trading though leveling up villagers can be a somewhat long process.
