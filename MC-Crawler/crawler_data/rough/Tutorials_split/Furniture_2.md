### Lamps or light sources
Using a redstone lamp is the easiest way to create a toggle-able light source. Alternatively, you can use one of the following methods:

To make a lamp, place a fence block and put a torch (or some glowstone) on top. it can also work with a cobblestone wall or end rod.

One method to create a side table-looking light is placing a glowstone, sea lantern, redstone lamp or other full-block light source on your floor, and put a trapdoor on each side. Or you could put lights behind paintings as well.

Another method is making an invisible lamp, by placing your preferred light source in your floor and cover it with a carpet, which doesn't block the light.

Or, to make a different kind of lamp, build up three blocks from your original ceiling, place glass where the original ceiling was and leave one block open for an escape hatch and start placing lava. This would be best used in creative mode in a netherrack/nether bricks structure (creative mode because depending on how big your house is it might take a lot of lava to cover the ceiling!)

Mood lighting can be made by placing a glowstone block and shield it on all sides but one. Next, place a slab in the remaining spot. The result is a small patch of slightly whiter light. This will not create a radius of light however, so it's solely for the effect.

A modern/futuristic style light can be made by placing down any block and then a stone slab (or any half-step) on top. Then remove the bottom block and put another half step in its place. Put a glowstone block on top of all of it. It should look like the glowstone hovers above the stone slabs.

Another modern way is to have a wall with stairs on all of the bottom row of blocks but the corners, and place glowstone in the corners. Then place one more stair piece next to the glowstone to make an 8Ã—8 pixel square of glowstone. Lastly, place a half slab of the same type of the stair (wood plank, cobblestone, stone brick, sandstone) on the glowstone. There you have a modern 'glowing' couch piece. I recommend either stone brick (modern) or sandstone (blends in with glowstone).

Using lava as lighting can create a cool effect. Place a non-flammable block on the ground. Place a block next to that, and place glass on there, before removing the second block you placed. Do this on all sides, before placing any amount of layers of glass on top of the glass. Pour lava down the resulting tube, and place a non-flammable block on the top. Another way (This is best for dungeons) is to place lava and put iron bars in front of the lava (This may not work in 1.13 because of updated water physics).
Note: This is dangerous if anything within four blocks of your lava lamp is flammable. Not recommended for houses with lots of wood/wool.

### Curtains
Curtains can be useful for the sides of bathtubs, or just as decoration anywhere. Attach a row of blocks under your ceiling, and then attach vines to the sides. The vines will grow hanging down, and create curtains for you. 

Another alternative is to use wool. Just make a small wall of wool in front of your window or open space, and privacy is perfect!

Also, as of version 1.8, you can use banners as curtains. First, make a banner. The color and design are up to you, but a plain white banner is good with many homes. Next, you must put up the banner. For one block high windows, place the banner on the block above it. If the window is two blocks high, place the banner on the higher glass block of the two. For three or more, place banners on every row except the bottom one. This design makes a nice hanging curtain that lets light in and can easily be removed.

Ladders and/or trapdoors could also be used as open window shutters.

### Other furniture
It's a good idea to add a crafting table to your bedroom, and possibly a jukebox. Crafting tables and jukeboxes already exist in the game, so there is no need to build them differently. You can also make mini-tree from a leaf block on a fence block or a moss block atop a potted azalea.

## Closets
To make a closet, first, dig two blocks tall and one block wide into a wall. If you want to make it wider, dig in deeper and start to dig spreading out. Then, go outside of the little "room" you've made and put a door at the entrance. You can make a four by four entrance but you will have to put double doors.
Since you cannot really "place" armor in the game (except in 1.8, if you use an armor stand), you must use a chest and put the chest into the closet, or if you still want to be able to see the armor put up a row of item frames with the armor inside.

## Living room furniture
The living room is your house's heart, where you can gather with friends (if you're on a server) and spend your time, if you want to.

### Tables
Tables are an essential furniture item in every living room. Read on to find out how to make many different table designs!

#### Coffee table
To create a coffee table, use any type of slab and place them near your sofas, chairs, etc. To make a mug, try a flower pot with nothing in it. As part of the new 1.13 update, sea pickles will work as mugs too. You can also place multiple sea pickles on one block.
