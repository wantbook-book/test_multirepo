### Spread Mechanics
When a mushroom receives a  random tick, it has a 4% chance of attempting to spread. When this happens, the game chooses a block near the mushroom and, if a mushroom could be planted in the chosen location, a new mushroom appears there; otherwise the attempt fails. The algorithm used to choose the new location for the attempt is not a simple random selection, but a multi-step algorithm that depends partly on which surrounding blocks are valid locations for planting a mushroom.

Some key aspects of the spread algorithm are:

- Mushrooms may theoretically spread up to five blocks away (including diagonally along all 3 axes), though only if the blocks in between are valid mushroom locations. Spreading this far has a low probability as a majority of spreads are within 2 blocks of the original mushroom, and the most common locations are within one block of the original mushroom.
- The algorithm is weighted in a way that favors spread to nearby y-levels. This further reduces the chance of a mushroom spreading far in the y direction.

Note that a block is considered a valid location for a mushroom to be planted if:

- the block at the new location is empty
- the block below the new location isopaque
- the light level at the new location must be < 13 (unless the block below is mycelium, podzol, or nylium)

In addition, mushrooms attempt to spread only if there are fewer than 5 mushrooms of the same type in an area of 9×9×3 around the original mushroom.

## Mooshrooms
Shearing a mooshroom drops 5 of its respective mushrooms and convert it into the normal cow. Every ~5 minutes mooshrooms can enter love mode and make a baby, which can replace any adults that have been sheared.

## Farming methods
### Mooshroom farming
This method involves breeding mooshroom cows or striking Mooshroom cows with lightning, and then shearing them for their respective mushroom type. 5 mushrooms are dropped when sheared. This is a cheap and quick method to obtain large quantities of mushrooms in quick succession.

### Basic small mushroom farming
This method relies on thorough lighting to ensure a monster-free, no-mining-required farm for the beginner mushroom farmer. Create a room two blocks high and as large horizontally as desired. At regular intervals dig one block up into the ceiling of your room, and place a torch to create recessed lighting. This casts light of level 12 at floor height, allowing mushrooms to grow and spread. You can place torches at a distance of up to six squares between each other with no danger of mobs spawning. This setup allows for the fastest mushroom growth. Spread the mushrooms on the floor with room around them to grow and wait.

Another way involves making the farming area just one block high and paving any walkways with slabs and using a water system to channel the mushrooms out of the farm room and into a collection point. This removes most of the danger since mobs cannot spawn on half-blocks or in one-block-tall areas and any other areas can be lit up. The Nether is a safe place to start a mushroom farm since mobs there do not spawn in small spaces.

Farming mushrooms in this way can be rather difficult due to their slow growth. The most efficient method if one must use small mushrooms would be to plant unlike mushrooms in pairs, each pair no less than 9 blocks away from its neighbors -- preferably on mycelium so they can spread in any light level. By planting unlike pairs, one can get 10 mushrooms in a 9×10×3 space instead of just 5 in a 9×9×3 space. Obtaining a high yield requires a significant time and space investment, and typically isn't preferable unless huge mushrooms aren't feasible.

Another option is to prepare a large underground room and use bonemeal to grow huge mushrooms, which can then be mined for multiple mushrooms per mushroom block. In order to secure a reliable source of bonemeal, the player can set up a crop farm and grow wheat, potatoes, carrots, pumpkins or melons as a "fodder crop" and use a composter to convert the produce and any excess seeds into bonemeal.

### Tunnel method
One way of growing a red mushroom on the surface of the world at any time of day without mycelium (using bone meal) is to dig a tunnel starting from several blocks where the mushroom should sprout, and plant the mushroom two or three blocks below the surface at the end of the tunnel. Then, dig a single block chute to the surface from above the mushroom. If the mushroom is deep enough underground, it does not pop off when exposed to the light above it. Once there's light, use the bone meal and see if it grows the mushroom. If it does not, there may be too many blocks in the way of the mushroom, in which case, planting the mushroom closer to the surface may make it grow.
