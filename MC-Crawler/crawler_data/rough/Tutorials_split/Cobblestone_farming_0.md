# Tutorials/Cobblestone farming
Cobblestone farming is the technique of using a cobblestone generator to produce cobblestone without damaging the terrain. Cobblestone generators work on the principle that when a lava stream comes into contact with water, the lava is turned into cobblestone. This fresh cobblestone then prevents the two streams from touching. When this fresh cobblestone is removed, the two fluids produce another piece of cobblestone. Variants of the generator can also produce stone, but this is generally trickier, because for stone, the lava must enter the water from above.

Many generator designs exist, but the simplest way is to make a five block long trench with a one block gap in the middle. Then, place water in it at the end closest to the hole and lava at the other end. This creates cobblestone where the fluids meet.  

When producing cobblestone, one must be careful not to let the flowing water touch the lava source block. Doing so destroys the lava source, converting it into obsidian. A basic understanding of fluids is helpful to prevent this.  If you place a stair into the water source (flat side to the lava), this prevents the water from flowing over the lava source, but the cobblestone still forms where flowing lava touches the waterlogged block.  Placing a non-flammable block over the lava helps prevent the cobblestone item from being destroyed by the lava when you mine it, as well as keep you from falling into it.

Adding pistons can let a generator extrude a whole line of blocks, safely away from the lava and easily mined as a batch.  Subtle variations of these designs can produce "plain" stone as described below.  The pistons and other arrangements for these generators can also be repurposed for a basalt generator.  Basalt generators don't need the water streams at all, just the lava, blue ice, and soul soil.  Note: soul soil is needed, not soul sand.  You can convert soul sand to soul soil by making and breaking soul campfires.

## Reasons to build
While the popularity of building any form of cobblestone generator varies, there are many reasons why a player should build a cobblestone generator. Here are a few.

- Obtaining cobblestone without changing the environment.
- Need for a massive quantity of cobblestone.
- Self-repairing objects, e.g. walls, floors, pillars.
- On a map without stone, e.g. superflat.
- To obtainexperiencethrough smelting.
- To trade stone with Mason villagers.

## Pistonless generators
Pistonless generators have been around for quite a while. However, Their usefulness is limited because cobblestone is so readily available. These generators require the player to mine and collect the fresh cobblestone in close proximity with lava. This both presents risks to the player and reduces efficiency if the dropped cobblestone is destroyed by the lava. These drawbacks can be mitigated by design choices, for example by removing the block under the cobblestone, allowing the loot to fall in a safe place, or collecting drops using a hopper.

Notes about the schematics here: Gold blocks indicate any fireproof block. Water and lava source blocks may be marked with "s" when there is possible confusion. Cobblestone or normal stone appear only where they form. An "x" indicates a place to stand while mining the cobblestone.

### Basic generators
A lava stream touching a water stream is the simplest type of generator. In a 10-block long trench with sources at either end, the cobblestone forms next to the lava. With a little more digging, you can manage this more compactly, and even get a current to wash the mined cobblestone away from the lava. This and the next design are easily expandable for multiplayer use.

### Fountain generator
A fountain-style generator offers more convenient mining, but takes more work to construct than the basic version. This one also uses two lava streams for faster production.

### From below generator
The "From Below" generator is a small building with the generator on the roof. Putting the generator on the roof means very little cobblestone is lost to the lava, but it is a lot more work. This one also uses two lava streams.

## Piston generators
Pistons can be used to automate cobblestone generation and reduce the amount of cobblestone lost. Piston cobblestone generators work on the same principle as standard generators, but rather than mining, a piston pushes the fresh stone out of the way, allowing the streams to touch once again. Piston cobblestone generators can be used both to create a large supply of cobblestone that the player can mine later, or to supply a self-repairing structure with blocks. The piston can be driven by a clock, or by a circuit to detect when a cobblestone block has appeared. The cobblestone extends in a long line or pillar; if you don't want it to extend out to the full 12 blocks, you can "cap" it with any unpushable block. Furnaces work well, and you have plenty of cobblestone handy to make them.
