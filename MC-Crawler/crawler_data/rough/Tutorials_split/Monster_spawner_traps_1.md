### The Front
The setup at the front will vary according to which monster you are farming:

- Zombies:a simple gated fence will do. Maximize your view of the monster spawner, so that they come to the fence quickly.
- Spiders:cover the front with pillars of blocks, floor to ceiling, but with 1-block wide slits open between them. Some glass at the ceiling can keep the spiders from sticking up there out of reach. You can then attack them freely, but they can't come through. To defend against creepers and other non-spider spawns, you can make these slits two-high, between the top and bottom slabs (that is, three blocks total, but with the top and bottom spaces half-blocked by slabs). The "tall" monsters will not recognize these as passable, but you can move or attack through them easily (or you can just put fences and gates to block walking monsters).
- Cave spiders:you can place a door between floor-to-ceiling fences (see pictures below). Iron doors are better so that you can't accidentally open them while you're attacking the spiders. Note that cave spider monster spawners don't come pre-enclosed in a dungeon, so you'll likely need to start by building a room around them. Remember to open up the entire 9×9×3 area so that you don't get snuck up on by spiders spawning in a way that ignores walls. Again, glass can help keep them from climbing out of reach.
- Skeletons:are the trickiest, as they can shoot through even brief gaps the moment they get the angle. For the actual killing zone, you want fences/gates at eye level (so they can't shoot you), with an open row below (so you can attack). If you stand directly in front of the fence, they will usually come up to the front so you can attack them. That row in front of the fence can also be a trench—you can reach further into the room, but then they can occasionally get an arrow or two under the fences.

### Redstone and other contraptions
1. The most common use of Redstone is to switch a flood system on and off. Instead of placing the water blocks yourself, embed dispensers in the floor or wall, each containing a bucket of water. You will need Redstone dust and switches to power these, but remember that flowing water will wash away Redstone and switches.
2. If you're ambitious, you can build a system to light up the dungeon when you flick a switch. This will be much easier if you haveredstone lamps, but it can even be done with blocks pulled by pistons to uncover jack-o-lanterns.
3. You can also convert the front to feed monsters into a killing device as discussed below. If they are killed without player intervention, you will not get all of the drops, nor experience, but this can still be useful for the drops you do get. You can also tune the device to soften up the monsters before killing them yourself.

- A classic water floor for normal dungeons.
- Redstone lamps controlling a monster spawner.
- Containing cave spiders.
- A more elaborate farm, using water to wash them forward.

## Killing mechanism
Any standard mob grinder can be connected to a dungeon. However, the purpose of this device is for players who are currently low on materials and can't yet build something larger. A hopper can be used to collect the items into a chest.

### Lava blade traps
A 3-tier lava blade trap, intended to kill mobs of different heights.
A lava blade trap consists of using water underneath the monster spawner and funneling these into a single line. At this point, the mob should find themselves approaching a sign at ground level and a 'lava blade' above it which flows over the top of the sign, but no further. This allows the mob to drop items at their feet for your collection. A tutorial can be found here:
https://youtu.be/EcOySVPf_t0 .

#### Timed lava dispenser
The external view of a timed lava mechanism, showing the end of the water stream, the hoppers, the nether brick fence, the dispenser, the sign to stop the lava, and the button.
A variant to the classic lava blade, the timed lava dispenser can be used to damage a zombie or skeleton to the point where one hit can kill it, allowing the player to get advanced drops and XP.

1. The mob arrives by water stream through a two block high, one block wide tunnel, and is pushed up against anether brick fenceor acobblestone wall).
2. A dispenser is placed to dispense lava on top of this fence post, while a sign prevents the lava from flowing into the tunnel.
3. A button is linked to a redstone timing mechanism that will activate the dispenser twice; once right away when the button is pressed, and then a second time a few seconds later to retract the lava.
4. Since the mob is halfway on the block with the fence post, it will be damaged by the lava, but since its feet are still in water, the damage stops exactly at the moment the lava is retracted.
5. Hoppers under the fence post and the block before that in the tunnel can catch all dropped items.

The timing in the repeaters will have to be adjusted depending on the mob type.

### Drowning traps
See also: Tutorials/Drowned farming

Drowning traps employ water to drown the hostile mobs. Mobs and items float in water. In this example, the dungeon is a 5×5 spider monster spawner, since drowning traps don't work on zombies and skeletons.

1. Capture the monster spawner and place water in one of the corners. The opposite corner should have one dry block.
2. Dig a small hole in the dry corner. This is where the water channel is recommended.
3. Place two signs in the corners and one in the hole. Water considers signs to be solid blocks.
4. When water is placed in the corner, it will be held in place, even though it will look like it is flowing backward.
5. Placeglassblocks in the corner to create the drowning chamber. Any solid block works. Glass panes and iron bars have a space of air that the mobs can breathe in, rendering the trap useless.
6. Fill the chamber with water to the ceiling.
7. Close up the chamber.
8. Place a water stream at the top of the chamber to push the items.
9. Place a top slab in the water source. It should get waterlogged, so it will still drown the mobs and also push the items.

Take out the torches and enclose the dungeon. Use signs to hold up water.

Zombies and skeletons will sink instead of float, and will not drown. This new feature provides other opportunities, however; for example, harvesting drowned in Bedrock Edition is a source of tridents and nautilus shells.

Please note that the below tutorial is slightly imperfect; the glass panes have air spaces, sometimes letting the mobs survive. Use glass blocks instead, to prevent this.

- Capture monster spawner.
- Place water in one corner. Dig a hole in the opposite corner.
- Place signs.
- First source in drowning chamber.
- Glass panes.
- Fill the rest of the drowning chamber.
- Enclose drowning trap.
- Collection stream.

Please note that you must fill up the column using source blocks, not just one at the top.
