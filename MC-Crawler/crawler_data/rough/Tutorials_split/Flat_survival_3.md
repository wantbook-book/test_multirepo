## Getting the most out of your village
### Villager professions
Decide what professions your villagers should have. For your first villagers, with the resources you have available, you can craft only five different kinds of job site blocks:

- Acauldron(which you already have) is used by aleatherworker.
- Acomposteris used by afarmer.
- Abarrelis used by afisherman.
- Aloomis used by ashepherd.
- Asmithing tableis used by atoolsmith(and requires 2 iron ingots).

Any beds or job site blocks should not be near the villager at first. Put them in your inventory or in a chest (including your cauldron). Your newly-cured villager might be one that wouldn't normally exist because it doesn't match any of those professions (such as an armorer, butcher, cleric, fletcher, stone mason, or weaponsmith). Trade what you can with that villager before giving it a profession. 

If you get a nitwit, keep it for breeding.

After you get a few emeralds from trading with villagers, you might be able to obtain sugar cane from a wandering trader. With sugar cane, you can craft paper, from which you can create books and bookshelves, which in turn let you craft two more job site blocks:

- Acartography table(not useful in a flat world) is used by acartographer.
- Alecternis used by alibrarian.

The rest of the job site blocks require stone, but stone isn't available in a flat world without a lava bucket.

### Useful trades
Villagers can sell you useful items which are otherwise unobtainable or extremely hard to obtain. They can also have useful trades that let you obtain emeralds easily.

- Cartographers don't sell you anything useful in a flat world, although you can get emeralds from them by selling them paper once you get sugar cane from a wandering trader. It isn't worth selling them glass panes (you can get glass from a librarian) until you getHero of the Villagefrom a raid.
- Farmers can sell you great food sources, like golden carrots, bread, and apples. You can also sell them the crops you grow in exchange for emeralds. Farmers can buy wheat, carrots, potatoes, beetroot, melons, and pumpkins.
- A fisherman can sell youcampfires. A campfire is quite useful to you, because you can cook food to make the food more effective, you can use it in place of lava to kill iron golems in an iron farm, and breaking a campfire gives 4charcoalfrom which you can make 16torchesfor much-needed light. You can sell fishermen items you get from fishing, like cod, salmon, tropical fish, and pufferfish, which is handy for getting rid of junk items. You can also sell them string and boats, and they can cook fish for you.
- Leatherworkers can sell you saddles and leather horse armor, which are useful because a horse is the fastest and most efficient way to travel in flat. You can also sell them leather from cows and trader llamas you killed. It's a good idea to breed cows for this.
- Librarians can sell you lanterns, which are slightly better light sources than torches (emitting light level 15 like campfire). They can also sell glass, which is not obtainable otherwise, and enchanted books, which you can use on tools and weapons after you get an anvil.
- Shepherds are a source of emeralds. They sell mostly non-essential things like dyed wool, carpets, banners, and beds in colors that are unobtainable or hard to get. They can also sell youshears.
- Toolsmiths can sell you diamond pickaxes, hoes, shovels, and axes. They are the only reasonable way to obtain diamond tools. You can also get stone and enchanted iron tools from them, and you can sell iron to them, which is handy if you have an iron farm.

### Wandering traders
Before you have any emeralds, a wandering trader may appear occasionally. There is no penalty for killing it, and no real advantage either. Killing a wandering trader gives you a couple of leads, which you can also get by crafting the string and slimeballs that you likely already have in abundance. The trader llamas can be a source of leather, which you can already get from the cows that spawn in a flat world.

However, after you earn some emeralds from trading with villagers, wandering traders become valuable resources, because they offer items that are normally impossible to get, such as:

- Glowstonefor an additional light source beyond the four torches you started with
- Sugar caneto make paper, which opens the way to making a librarian job site block and librarian villager, which can sell youlanternsfor more light
- Different colormushroomsthat let you to makemushroom stew, because you most likely got only one color of mushroom in your bonus chest
- Crop seeds that you may not have had before
- Saplingsto grow more types of trees than what you already have
- Apumpkin(or the seeds to grow a pumpkin), which lets you increase the illumination of a torch from 14 to 15 if you useshearsto create aJack o'Lantern
- Sandorred sand, which you can use to growcactusif your bonus chest included cactus (and the wandering trader may also sell cactus), which can be used for defense or in mob grinders
- Cocoa beansthat you can grow on jungle logs (and the wandering trader may also sell jungle saplings)

### Iron golem farming
Main article: Tutorials/Iron golem farming
You have many options for an iron farm in either Bedrock Edition or Java Edition. If you have trapped a villager in a boat, it's easy in a flat world to drag the boat wherever you want using a lead‌[Bedrock Edition  only], or row it over land, to put each villager exactly where you want it.

In Bedrock Edition, you can have a working village and an iron farm coexist so that you can obtain iron at a decent rate while continuing to trade with villagers (see Tutorials/Iron golem farming § Survival mode build: Iron golem village), but because you have limited illumination, you must make sure your village and sleeping bunker have no spawnable surfaces anywhere inside the fence.

You can use campfires to kill the iron golems. It is a much slower method than using lava but it is the best available in a flat world where lava is unobtainable. Without campfires, you may need to resort to slower or more dangerous methods, such as using the cactus from your bonus chest, or contriving to have a confined skeleton shoot at the golem.
