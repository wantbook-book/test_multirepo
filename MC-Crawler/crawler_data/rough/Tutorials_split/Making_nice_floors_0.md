## Overview
If a player is planning on staying in a certain house for a long time, they probably want it to look nice. Having nice floors can help with the appearance of a house greatly. Additionally, floors can give players a certain "feel" to the house; for example, using different colors of wool may make them think of the house as happy and colorful, while a mix on nether bricks, diorite, and netherrack with fire on it may make give them a sinister and foreboding feeling of the house.

Fancy and polished floors are usually achieved best by alternating two different blocks. This can be wood and wood planks, polished andesite and polished granite, black concrete and white concrete, or more. Brighter floors that look happier are usually achieved with different colors of wool, concrete, terracotta, or glazed terracotta, such as red, yellow, orange, and lime.

The exact types of flooring to put in your house is up to you. However, read through this tutorial for some suggestions on certain floors that may look nice for your house.

## Floor textures
The requirements listed below are calculated for a 5×5 floor. The grids show sizes for many types of floors, often including a 6×6.

### With Wood and Wood Planks
Wood is one of the most common materials used for floors in Minecraft, as well as floors in real life. Different combinations of wood logs and wood planks can give houses different styles. The advantage of wood is that trees are both very common and fully renewable.

#### Horizontal Wood Logs
Requirements: 18 wood planks, 18 logs 
This design has a fancy and polished look. It is somewhat spareful, but not as spareful as if it were made with solely wood planks. The wood logs are hard to orient, but this can be solved by placing the wood planks first and then the logs. Place the wood logs on the back and front sides of the wood planks, to get them to face the correct direction.

#### Vertical Wood Logs
Requirements: 18 wood planks, 18 logs 
This design requires the exact same materials as the previous. It is not as fancy as it would be if using horizontal wood logs, but it's easier to orient.

#### Differently Oriented Wood Logs
Requirements: 36 logs 
This design has a detailed and polished feel to it. However, it requires lots of wood, and it is hard to orient the logs. The easiest way to orient the logs is to place all of the vertical logs first and then the horizontal ones.

### 
Granite, andesite, and diorite, were added in 1.8 for building. These three types of stone, when un-polished, can give a floor an old, eroding feel to it, while using combinations of the polished versions of granite, andesite, and diorite, can result in a tile-like floor.

#### Tile-like Floor
Requirements: 18 polished andesite, 18 polished diorite 
This design with alternating polished andesite and diorite is great for a tiled floor, such as for a kitchen or a bathroom.

#### Eroding Floor
Requirements: 16 andesite, 9 diorite 
This type of floor does not look fancy or polished, but it is great for an old floor that looks like its eroding away. It is basically a floor of andesite with diorite placed randomly throughout. Note that this grid is for a 5×5 floor, unlike the others, which were for a 6×6.
