### A note on lava
Lava can quickly kill mobs and can be suspended on either a ladder or a sign. To suspend the lava, create a 3-long channel then put a sign or ladder on the last block. Lava spreads three blocks away from the source, so the last section of the lava will be left suspended on the sign or ladder.

Lava generates light, which can lower the spawn rate in the dungeon unless placed far away; however the increased turnover of mobs may compensate for this.

Since Java Edition 1.11, you can use an anvil, nametag and a vindicator to make a monster monster spawner trap.
First, you need to find a monster spawner, then you need to make a wall with a door to make no monsters to leave the trap, then lure a vindicator to inside the trap.

Then you go to your anvil and rename the nametag to "Johnny", then right-click the vindicator with the name tag. After it is renamed, the vindicator will attack any other mob except other illagers.

It's recommended to put more vindicators inside the trap. and also it's recommended to heal your vindicator using Potions of Healing.

- Step 1
- Step 2, Note: Glass is optional.
- Step 3, Note: Any way to lure a vindicator works.
- Step 4 (Have a Name Tag with "Johnny" in it).
- Step 5: Profit!

### Magma trap
Magma blocks can be placed around the monster spawner as a floor, allowing mobs to spawn and then killing them. Items can be collected via minecart with hopper running below the floor, or with water leading to hoppers, making the trap fully automatic.

## Other
Traps that use unusual methods, such as huge pits, fall into this category.

Note: Using a slab of cobble, planks, or sandstone in murder holes will prevent creepers and skeletons from seeing you, then you can retrieve items without breaking blocks, place the slab on top of where the mobs would usually stand.

Note: Water mob elevators no longer work on zombies or skeletons, as they now walk along the bottom of water. They will still rise up bubble columns created by soul sand, but the challenge is getting them to enter the column.

### Pit trap
For this method, you must dig a pit that reaches far under the dungeon. Depending on the height (at least 23 blocks), the mob will die on impact, as long as there aren't any blocks of water at the bottom and the mob has weak enough or no armor. However, this method takes a long time to make and only works for monster spawners near or above the surface. Alternatively, you can build an elevator for the mobs using alternating water and signs to bring the mobs 23 or more blocks higher, and then drop them 23 or more blocks in order to kill them (or you can do 22 blocks if being used for an XP farm). Keep in mind that skeletons and zombies can randomly spawn with armor, which can be enchanted randomly. This can be remedied by placing a platform of magma blocks at the bottom.

### Experience trap
For this trap, you need to dig a large pit 22 blocks deep under the dungeon, or make a water elevator taking them upwards so you can stay near the monster monster spawner. Go to the bottom of the pit and place water in a fashion so that it should flow towards a wall. Then make a room where the water is flowing. This is where you will stay while finishing off the mobs. Make the room so that it has a one-block hole where you can see the mob drop zone. Hopefully, mobs should spawn, fall down the pit and survive with half a heart, get pushed towards you by the water current, and get killed by a single hit. If you like, you can bring food along as your hunger will deplete over time. This should provide normal as well as rare mob drops and experience levels, making it quite useful. Another technique is to leave your player by the dungeon for a couple of hours, overnight is suggested, and there will be at least a hundred monsters waiting to be harvested. Keep in mind that the maxEntityCramming gamerule can limit the output.

- This grinder does not work in 1.13+, since skeletons and zombies no longer swim. However, it is possible to build a similar grinder using soul sand block bubbles to bring mobs to the top of the water column (https://youtu.be/N5m2sReltMc). SeeTutorials/Drowned farmingfor an alternative simpler design
- Note, all dimensions are given the format: Horizontal x Vertical. This method is an indirect hybrid of the aforementioned traps, utilizing both fall damage and mob control with water. In the mob spawning room, dig 1 block down so that the monster spawner is at eye level, and place water blocks at two adjacent corners. On the wall opposite of the two water blocks, dig a 1×2 hole for three blocks in the middle of the wall (allowing mobs to pass through).

Begin digging upwards in a 1×2 fashion for 24 blocks. To get up, place signs on the long-faced wall (your left/right) in a zig-zag pattern going up while placing water blocks in between the signs. The first sign should be placed as furthest, lowest space possible. Stop placing signs after the 23rd level. The last water block should be against the wall furthest away from the mob monster spawner on the 24th level. 

On the 25-24 block levels, dig a 1×2 hole for seven blocks in the direction the mob monster spawner. On the seventh block in, dig one block downwards. Dig in the forward direction for eight more blocks (again, 1×2). You should notice the water block placed on the 24th level should stop where the path drops by one block. Place a water block against the wall of the drop. Notice how this water block stops 1 block short of the path.

Dig further for two block and begin to dig downwards in a 1×1 fashion for 22 blocks, Face the direction of the mob monster spawner and dig another 1×2 hole one block deep. Dig down one and fill the top level with one block so that you can only see through one block of the pit you just created (if you are using a skeleton monster spawner, you need to stand one block away from this hole so that the skeletons cannot shoot you). You are now standing at the loot point. Now that the almost-dead mobs are depositing into your 1×1 hole, simply attack them with any item to gain their loot and experience! You may use TNT + water to do splash damage to kill all mobs at once at the risk of lag spikes. Splash potions of Healing also work, as they do damage to most hostile mobs.

Note: you must have 2 block tall non-exploding mobs to do this or the mob either destroys or escapes from the trap.

Useful tips on this design by Duck//Marvin: When you make the opening in the spawn chamber for the mobs to exit, make it 3 blocks high and place a sign or slab at the top. This lets the mobs into the elevator more easily and prevents water spillage from the elevator. Also, making the transport corridors at the top 3 blocks tall instead of 2 allows the mobs to be transported faster as they do not hit the ceiling when they try to swim and get stuck.
