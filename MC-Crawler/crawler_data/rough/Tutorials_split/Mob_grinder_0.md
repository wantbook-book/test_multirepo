# Tutorials/Mob grinder
Mob grinders are the final part of a mob farm: the mob killing mechanism. Mob grinders can be used to kill many mobs while simultaneously collecting all dropped items at a convenient location.

Most mob grinders are specific to certain categories of mobs. Some grinders work only with tall mobs such as skeletons, zombies, and creepers, but don't work with shorter mobs such as spiders, pigs, and wolves. Other grinders work with both tall and short mobs, but don't work with mobs which are immune to fire damage.

Most of these mob grinders do not produce music discs or other rare drops as the mob deaths do not meet certain conditions. It is possible to build most grinders in such a way that it would be easy to fulfill these conditions, however. Regardless, the mobs drop experience only if killed by the player, not by automated means.

Fall damage is one of the simplest and quickest methods of mob grinding. This method is often done in combination with a mob farm where the mobs are forced into water streams and can easily be dropped from a lethal height. Some mobs are immune to fall damage. These include iron golems, chickens, cats, and flying mobs such as blazes.

The most important aspect of a fall damage grinder is the drop height. Different mobs need to be dropped different distances in order to kill them. Most common hostile mobs can be killed with a 24-block drop, although witches require 30 blocks. Some mobs, such as zombies and skeletons, can occasionally spawn with Feather Falling boots or armor that can change the required distance. Because of this, it is often better to make the drop further than necessary.

On the other hand, it is often desirable to kill the mobs manually in order to obtain experience and other exclusive drops. By dropping the mobs slightly lower than the minimum death height, it possible to make most mobs end up with 1 health points, so you can kill them with one hit. In Java Edition, it is not possible to bring zombies to half a heart, even with a combination of falling and suffocation, because zombies have 2 () natural armor points. If you wish to use your fist rather than a tool to kill the mobs, a strength beacon may provide the extra damage necessary to kill zombies and mobs with armor in a single hit. However, stone swords are cheap and plentiful, and you can also use tools (such as shovels) dropped by the zombies.

Spiders can be tricky to deal with as they can grab the walls and reduce fall damage. To kill spiders, a minimum of a 2×2 pit is necessary. You may want to dig the pit deeper than the required 19 blocks in case a spider does brush the wall at some point in its descent.

Tips:

- Bubble columnsare useful when getting the mobs up high enough to drop.
- If dropping the mobs to kill later, make an opening showing just their feet so they can't attack you.
- Witches and endermen must be killed immediately, or else the witch will heal itself and the enderman will teleport away.
- Magma blocksmay be useful to kill Feather Falling survivors.
- Landing onstalagmitesamplifies fall damage, reducing the height required for killing mobs or bringing them to minimal health points.

### Magma blocks
Magma blocks are a simple method of mob grinding. When mobs walk on a magma blocks, they are dealt 2 damage every second. This means an unarmored skeleton dies in about 10 seconds. To avoid being damaged while building, you should either wear Frost Walker boots, drink a Fire Resistance potion, or crouch.

Although magma blocks do not destroy items, collecting the items can be a little tricky. There are generally two options for item collection: Use water streams to wash items off the magma blocks or use hopper minecarts. Water streams have the downside of negating any fall damage and potentially causing the mobs to bob up and down, taking damage only some of the time. Running hopper minecarts on rails underneath the magma can solve both of these problems but is more expensive.

Not all mobs can be easily killed by magma blocks. Nether mobs, such as wither skeletons and blazes, are not affected by fire damage, so magma blocks are not useful as a nether grinder. Magma blocks are also ineffective against witches as they drink fire resistance potions negating damage. Spiders can also be tricky as they may climb walls and cause issues.
