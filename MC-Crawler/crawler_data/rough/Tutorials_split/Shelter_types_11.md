### Fort
A fort
A walled base capable of housing multiple players. It is built mostly for defensive values. It basically consists of a wall with buildings attached to it.

Materials

128 to 1000 material of your choice.

Description

A square of the wall with buildings attached to the inside of it. Towers can be put on the corners. Some designs have an open yard near the entrance with no buildings nearby. 

Construction

First, build a square or rectangle base with blocks. Then, build walls around the edge, leaving room for an exit/entrance. The next step is to plan the shape and build internal buildings, like towers, a bedroom, storeroom, etc. Give easy access to the walls, which should probably be three blocks high, so falling from them won't cause damage.

If you make your wall spider proof, make sure that you have a lip every second brick to prevent mobs from sneaking up on you as you leave. Not leaving gaps does have the advantage of making skeletons walk under it, rendering them unable to shoot you from the towers (though they will probably ambush you later).

Extras

- Escape tunnels just in case that zombie siege happens
- A mine
- Farms (doesn't have to be inside the fortress)
- Snow golem turrets (keep in mind that this won't hurt mobs)
- Dispenser turrets (put a dispenser in walls with arrows and put a pressure plate hooked up to it)

### 
A nice looking house that stops all mobs and is somewhat easy to build.

Materials

- 128 blocks of cobblestone
- 64 Glass or glass panes
- 32 wood

Construction

Make an outline of your building that is one block high out of cobble. Then, make studs with the cobble and the glass/glass panes like this: cobblestone, glass, cobblestone. Then, top it off with another layer of cobble. Once that is done, use the wood to make a roof and you are set. You can use the roof however you like, but make sure to prevent spiders from entering.

Notes

- This design is visually attractive and repels any mobs.
- To add more layers, simply repeat the process.

### Villager House
A standard home having many different types.

Materials

- Cobblestone
- Wooden planks
- Logs
- Wooden pressure plates
- Wooden stairs
- Cobblestone stairs
- Stone slabs
- Lava
- Iron bars
- Glass panes
- Bookshelves

Description

These homes depend on what you plan to build. How long they take to build will depend on what you plan to build. These are aesthetically pleasing homes, and don't require too many materials to construct them, depending on what you want of course.

Construction

See village blueprints for construction details.

Notes

- These are intricate, but can be completed within one day provided you have the required materials.
- If you are in a desert or other area and cannot acquire the regular materials, you can use materials in place of those; e.g. use spruce logs and planks instead of oak logs and planks or etc.

### Tower House
Description

This is a tower that has several floors and isn't that hard to build, but takes a while to make and requires a good deal of materials.

Materials

- Several stacks of wood
- A good deal of cobblestone to improve the house's integrity
- Lots of ladders/stairs

Construction

Build a one-block layer of cobblestone or other good flooring material. Make it as big as you want, but smaller is better because it means you won't have to make each floor as big. Next, make four three-high pillars of cobblestone on the corners. Make more pillars if you are paranoid of creepers, but the cobblestone should help absorb the blast in case of creeper attack. Fill in the walls with your wood. If you really don't want any creepers or have too much cobblestone, use that instead. Fill in the top with wood for a ceiling—two blocks high is nice, use slabs if you really want efficiency. Add windows. Use glass panes or iron bars. Repeat this until you reach your desired height.

Notes

Sneak while you build this! Falling is fatal from the 7th floor or above. The original author died while building the seventh floor.

Jungle trees are quite helpful. You can get nine or ten floors from two trees.

Make a quarry near this, especially if you are using several cobblestone pillars/cobblestone walls. Make it in the basement if you have a small area to build.

Try to keep the size down. 8×8 is a nice size.

Add-ons

- A quarry in the basement
- Sniper towers/deck
- A farm (make nearby or in basement, luring pigs up three floors is hard!)
- A wall or moat for the really paranoid people
- Wall-mounted cannons

### Treehouse 2.0
Description

Like the treehouse, but better for surviving in.

Materials

- Several stacks of wood planks
- One or more axes
- Torches
- 1–2 hours
- Trapdoors

Construction

First, find a tree. A jungle tree works fine, but it looks better if made in a large oak tree. Then, use wood planks to make a staircase winding around the outside of the tree, so you can jump up blocks all the way up. When you are 4 blocks beneath the top, hollow out an area. If you are doing it on a jungle tree, this step is not necessary. Then, build out as much as you want, replacing the walls, floor, and roof with wood planks. Keep the space open for you to come up the staircase. Keep windows open, and add trapdoors where you enter from the staircase. Add a workbench, furnaces, torches, and a bed to complete your new home.

Notes

This can be expanded upon. Simply build bridges to other trees and repeat this process. This is a good structure for avoiding monsters, but the trapdoors are necessary to keep mobs out.

Add - Ons

- More rooms
- A greenhouse
- Rope bridges
