### The EXTREME survival challenge
Create a superflat world and make a 400×800 barrier cage. Have the map on Hardcore mode. Add spawners for monsters that don't naturally spawn, such as vindicators, cave spiders, drowned, and a command block to summon a wither. At evening, bring in the contestants. Clear everyone's inventory and give each person a diamond sword, a full set of iron armor, and a bow enchanted with Power II and Infinity. Give everyone an arrow and a shield. Don't forget to give everyone some blocks. When the competition starts the wither should be summoned. Have everyone fight the monsters. Whoever is alive the next day gets a prize and can keep the wither's nether star and mob drops.

### Hopper Ball
Have a large 20×20 floor made of hoppers pointing at other hoppers, in a way that there will be no dead ends, but a lot of infinite loops. When the game starts, throw a diamond into one of the hoppers. Watch the contestants open the hoppers to try and get the diamond. Whoever gets it will win the competition and can keep the diamond.

The size of the arena depends on the # of players.

- 10×10: 2-3 players
- 20×20: 4-8 players
- 40×40: 9-20 players
- 80×80: 20-80 players
- 256×256: 80+
