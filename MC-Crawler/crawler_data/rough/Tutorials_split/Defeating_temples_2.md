## Witch hut
### Finding
A witch hut in a swamp biome.
Witch huts generate in Swamps and are a small house made of spruce wood with no door and a front porch. They are small and can be difficult to find.

### Looting
Your first step is to kill any witches that have spawned. Then, go inside and place a torch to light it up. Take the cauldron, crafting table, and the flower pot because they are useful. You can also tame the cat and bring it back to your base, or if you don't have raw fish then you can grab a lead and tie the cat to the fences on the windows.

## Aftermath
After raiding a temple, there are many things you can do with it, such as making it into a home, destroying it, mining it for extra resources, or simply leave. Here on some suggestions:

- Make a base:

These structures are nice looking and can be used to make a house. The desert temple is large enough to provide a long-term base, but the other 3 have to be expanded to make a large enough base. You can transform the structures to make them suitable for your needs. Include crafting tables, furnaces, enchanting room, brewery, and any other decorative rooms, such as kitchen, living room, or bedroom. For the desert temple and igloo, you can expand the lower chamber to add farms, mines, storage, or whatever you prefer. For the witch hut, you should redesign it into a larger base, and use the original structure bounding box to make a witch farm. If you want this structure to be your main base, and you have expanded it enough, consider adding villagers for a villager trading hall and large scale farms, such as crop farms, tree farms, cobblestone/stone/basalt generators, nether access, etc. Tip: The desert temple's 1st floor, above the treasure chamber, has many 1 wide slots, and those slots can be repurposed for a villager trading hall. You should also take advantage of the natural resources. In deserts, there is sand, dead bush, and cactus. There is jungle wood, bamboo, cocoa beans, pandas in jungles, snow in snowy tundra, and lily pads, blue orchids, slime, and clay in swamps.

- Strip it for its resources:

Aside from the loot, these structures contain resources that you can get. For the desert temple, you get sandstone related blocks, terracotta, and the TNT in the treasure chamber. In jungle temples, there is cobblestone and mossy cobblestone. In the treasure floor, you can get redstone components, such as pistons, sticky pistons, dispensers, tripwire hooks, string, repeaters, and redstone dust, which can save you some redstone when building redstone contraptions. In the igloo, there is not many useful items, aside from the redstone torches, ice, bed, crafting table, furnace, cauldron, brewing stand, and the villager and zombie villager. The witch hut is almost useless as it only has a bit of wood. The only thing worth taking is the cauldron.
