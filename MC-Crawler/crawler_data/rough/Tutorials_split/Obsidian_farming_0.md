# Tutorials/Obsidian farming
Obsidian farming refers to methods of obtaining large quantities of obsidian.  There are several places obsidian can be found:

The simplest and most common method is to pour water over lava source blocks to "drench" them, either in a naturally-occurring lava pool or transported in buckets.  Until recently, drenching lava was non-renewable, but Version 1.17 introduces a new mechanic for farming lava, using pointed dripstone and cauldrons.

Several structures can contain blocks of obsidian:  Ruined portals (in the Overworld and Nether), the rare woodlands mansion, and End ships all contain blocks of obsidian.  Obsidian can also appear as items in several loot chests, notably in villages, ruined portals, and bastions.  None of these are renewable.

Whenever a Nether Portal is created (to or from the Nether), a destination portal can be created.  This will be made of at least 14 blocks of obsidian, but the four corner blocks can be mined without affecting the portal proper.  If created in midair, the portal can generate with four more blocks as ledges, which can also be mined.

In the Overworld, obsidian technically does not generate with the terrain, but it can appear where natural lava pools are drenched by water.  Lava underground or at the base of ravines can be drenched by a natural spring, and lava at the base of an ocean ravine will be drenched by the water above it.   

In the Nether, lava is plentiful, but water cannot be used to drench it there.  However, piglins can provide obsidian (as items) through bartering.

The End provides huge amounts of obsidian:  The obsidian platform at entry is relatively small, but it is regenerated whenever a player enters the End.  The End Spikes consist of tall pillars of obsidian, and these are regenerated whenever the dragon is respawned.   And again, a few blocks can be found in the rare end ships.

## Mining times
Most methods of obsidian farming require manual mining. Obsidian is one of the toughest blocks in the game, so you'll need the right tools to take care of it. Enchanting a pickaxe with Efficiency greatly speeds up the farming process. With a beacon, the Haste and Haste II effects can be used to reduce mining time further. Below are the mining times for each level of enchantment. 

| Tool              | Enchantment    | Mining Time   |        |         | Blocks per minute |        |         |

## Lava drenching
The simplest way to obtain obsidian is to find lava and "drench" it with water to convert it into obsidian.  Before Version 1.17, this was not a renewable method of farming obsidian, since lava was not a renewable resource. 

### Obtaining lava
Main article: Lava § Natural generation
In order to create obsidian with this method, it is necessary to have a supply of lava. Lava can be found in a variety of locations, including in the Overworld and Nether.

In the Overworld, lava primarily occurs deep underground or at the bottom of ravines. Sometimes part of these pools will be drenched by a natural water spring.  However, it can occasionally also be found in small lakes, at or near the surface. It is also possible to find small lava springs, but since these typically only contain a single source block, they are not particularly useful.  It also occurs at the bottom of ocean ravines, where it is normally immediately drenched by the water over it.

Lava is much more plentiful in the Nether, but as water cannot be placed there, it is necessary to bring it back in buckets to the Overworld.

As of Version 1.17, there is a new way to farm lava, using pointed dripstone and cauldrons.
