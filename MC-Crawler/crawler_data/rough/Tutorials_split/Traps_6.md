### Chest lava trap




































































Chest trap
1. Build 2 rows ofsticky pistonssuch that are facing each other and the rows are 4 blocks apart.
2. Attach solid blocks to the rows of sticky pistons.
3. Link the rows of pistons toredstone torches.
4. Attach thetrapped chestto the Redstone torches.
5. Dig a hole below the sticky pistons and fill it with lava.
6. Decorate the area around the trapped chest to attract players!

### Lava pit
1. Make a 3×3 pit at least 4 blocks deep.
2. Placelavaat the top,laddersin the middle, andwaterat the bottom.
3. If you get mobs to go into the trap, they will burn in the lava and their drops should go into the water.

### Lava door
Make a house, and right inside the front door make a pit with lava. Most players will likely notice the trap and avoid it, so it works only on really careless players.

### Trapdoor lava pit
If the target should wander onto the pressure plate, good luck getting off!

### Lava filler
1. Make astoneroom.
2. Place apressure platein the room.
3. Connect the plate to adispenserwithlavain it on the ceiling.






## Capture traps
These traps don't actually kill the target. Instead another trap is often used, or the player can come later to kill captured mobs.

### Curiosity trap
1. Place a pressure plate on a piece of 3 by 3 flat land.
2. Place 4 iron doors in a way that when you step on the pressure plate, the doors will close, revoking your chance to escape.
3. Place a ceiling that is either blast resistant or unbreakable. Also have an observer under the pressure plate that connects to some TNT so that when a player tries to escape, they will get blown up. This not only traps the player, but it also kills the player if they try to escape. You can also replace the observer with a block that blends in with the terrain so that they cannot see the TNT.

This might work on only inexperienced players because experienced players can use the parts that are shown to think of what might happen to them if they went in. You may also have a bit like having a dropper that throws out diamonds to lure them over to the trap.

### Piston trap
























Piston trap
This trap is best for 2-tall tunnels, perhaps inside a friend’s mine. Make sure there is a roof over it, so when the target hits the pressure plate, it cannot escape. When the pressure plate is stepped on, two pistons push up. Note that players will easily be able to break blocks and escape so you probably will want to combine this with another trap.

### Door trap
This is a simple and rather obvious trap that is made by putting a pressure plate in the middle of 4 open iron doors so that the target is trapped inside when they enter. If using this trap against mobs such as skeletons, you don’t have to use iron doors.

### Shallow pitfall
Dig a 1-block deep pit at least 5×5 blocks. Place fences on the inside edge. Since fences count as one and one half blocks in height, mobs can walk in, but cannot jump out. Alternatively, line the outside with half-slabs. This can also be combined with a mob grinder, via water currents leading to it. Zombies and Skeletons will take damage from sunlight during the day if the pit is uncovered, making this an effective way to sort out creepers. This design does not capture spiders.

### Trapping pool
This trap is designed to trap skeletons and zombies, not to kill them!

1. Dig out a 5×5 square.
2. Dig a 3×3 square 2 layers deep in the center.
3. Place water in each of the corners and in the middle of each side on the top, where the water isn't flowing along the top.

### Slime trap
This simple trap targets slimes. 

1. Dig a 4×4 hole three blocks deep.
2. Fill the bottom layer with water, so that it is all still water on the bottom.

When a slime of any size wanders around, it may fall into the hole. Since slimes cannot jump in water, it will not be able to escape. You can come by later and kill all the slimes. If you are not interested in the drops, just leave them into lower slime population. This trap is best on superflat survival worlds where slimes spawn frequently. In that case, water can be obtained in villages.

### Quicksand
Step 1: Dig down an x/1<y/z (However wide and long you want, a minimum of 2 blocks deep) hole with soul sand on the bottom

Step 2: Fill it with water that goes up to 1 block below ground level, make sure bubble columns are made

Step 3/4: Fill in the area at ground level with cobwebs*

Step 3/4: Place sand in the bubble columns*

Step 5: Knock someone in!


Explanation: The bubble columns keep the sand on the same level as the cobwebs, so it just looks like slightly darker sand (entity and block shading are different) but sand entities don't collide with players or mobs, so you get stuck in the cobwebs and you need to use a sword or shears to break them, and you have to hit through the sand entities. You could also break a block at the edge of the hole.


NOTE: Only works on BE, in Java the sand will break after several seconds.

*You can do step 4 before 3, or vice versa, so they're 3/4
