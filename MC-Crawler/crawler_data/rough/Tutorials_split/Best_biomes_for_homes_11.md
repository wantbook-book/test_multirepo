### Badlands
The canyons hold a lot of terracotta. While only a select few variants have some useful trees to start out with, you'll want to come back here to enjoy the scenery. Apart from the scenery, you can also mine out the plentiful terracotta for other projects. Like the desert or mushroom fields, it's best to start out somewhere else and return here when you have gathered some basic materials. You can also find above ground mineshafts in this biome.

#### Pros
- Good source ofgold ores, which can generate above the surface level.
- Plenty ofcacti.
- Scenery is great for building here in the natural plateau, and the Eroded Badlands Biomes are picturesque.
- Surface-levelmineshaftsgenerate, which can be a source of wooden planks as well as a good place to find ores and loot.
- There is a lot ofterracottahere that players can mine out.
- The only place wherered sandcan be found, which is useful forred sandstone,glassorTNT.
- You can easily getsticksby breaking the dead bushes without the need to craft them, a good strategy sincetreesare scarce in this biome.

#### Cons
- Not much surface-level or near-surface-level stone.
- It is rather hard to find wood here, and while the badlands can have oak trees, relying on the chances of spawning there is not efficient as it generates only in wooded badlands plateau variants.
- Lack of passive mobs and therefore meats and their other products cannot be obtained.
	- InBedrock Edition, eroded badlands can spawn cows, chickens, pigs and sheep, so it's better to live in these badlands variants.

#### Useful resources
Terracotta, dead bushes, red sand, red sandstoneâ€Œ[Java Edition  only], cacti, gold, and oak wood from trees in wooded badlands are useful resources found in 
canyon biomes.

#### Tips
- Make sure to collect the saplings from the trees in the Wooded Badlands Plateau biome! You want to make sure you never run out of trees or their saplings.
- Use a mineshaft to get down somewhere you can get stone, ores, and even chest loot from minecarts there.
- Make sure to have another biome close by to get as much food as you can.
- Set up a resource base here for the massive amounts of gold. This biome provides you enough gold for a lifetime.
- Terracotta is also abundant. Use your resource base for collecting them.Terracottaare awesome for building, andglazed variantsare brilliant for decoration.

## Underground biomes
While living on the surface allows for more open building options and easier movement, living under the surface allows the player to remain right next to the vast resources of Minecraft's underground. Across all cave biomes, there are ores and structures that help greatly in progressing and gaining stronger equipment.

Note that the underground can be split into two similar sections; The upper half of the underground is comprised of stone blocks, and contains mainly coal, copper, iron, and in some biomes, emeralds; The lower half is made up of deepslate, a darker and tougher rock, and contains iron, gold, redstone, and diamonds. Structures like mineshafts, geodes, and strongholds can typically generate at any height, but some structres, such as an ancient city, generate only in the deepstone layer.

#### Useful resources
Stone, deepslate,dirt, gravel, andesite, diorite, granite, tuff, coal, copper, iron, gold, redstone, lapis lazuli, diamonds, emeralds, obsidian, dungeon/mineshaft/stronghold/amethyst geodes loot and mob farming opportunities are useful resources found here.

### Lush caves
The lush caves are a rather peaceful underground biome, being covered in greenery comprised of moss blocks, azalea bushes, and glow berries. The glow berries provide a significant amount of light to the caves, meaning hostile mobs are frequently prevented from spawning in areas where the light can reach the ground. Additionally, pools of water containing clay and dripleaf plants, as well as the axolotls, a cute, friendly creature that can be caught with a water bucket. 

#### Pros
- Easily the safest cave biome, making it the easiest biome to start a home in.
- Axolotls, once carried in a water bucket, become allied to the player. They can be quite helpful in raidingocean monuments, as they can provide the player with theRegenerationeffect, as well as "play dead" should they be low on health.

#### Cons
- While the glow berries often prevent monster spawning, it it not always be sufficient. Remain wary of monsters in darker areas in these caves.
- The overgrowth of flora can be somewhat tedious to clear out, should the player wish to do so.

#### Useful resources
Moss blocks, azalea bushes glow berries, dripleaf plants, clay, axolotls, tropical fish, general underground resources.

### Dripstone caves
Dripstone caves are mainly just regular caves with dripstone formations all across the floor and ceilings of caves, and small water pockets under dripstone stalactites. While they are a spectacle, the biome does not offer much in way of unique resources. Drowned zombies do spawn occasionally in this biome, and those wielding tridents can pose a threat, as they can knock loose stalactites that deal damage should they fall on the player. 

#### Pros
- Dripstone has uses in various farms; A stalactite dripping either water or lava over a cauldron slowly fills the cauldron with that liquid, making both liquids renewable, while stalagmites can be used to assist in killing monsters that are dropped onto them in a mob farm.
- Aside from oceans, this is a decent place to search for a trident, though they are far more likely to be found in oceans.

#### Cons
- Falling dripstone stalactites deal a significant amount of damage to the player, so take care to watch out for trident-wielding drowned. Similarly, falling on a dripstone stalagmite deals increased falling damage to the player.

#### Useful resources
Dripstone blocks, pointed dripstone, tridents (from drowned), general underground resources.
