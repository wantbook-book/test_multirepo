### Minceraft
Main article: Main menu § Minceraft
There is a 0.01% chance for the title screen to display "Minceraft" instead of "Minecraft". The beginning of crash logs can have the phrase "You should try our sister game, Minceraft!"

- Minceraft in the crash logs.
- Minceraft in-game.

Main article: Crash
The "Someone is closing me!" Easter Egg.
After a crash, the second-to-last line of text on the game output launcher tab says "Someone is closing me!"

### Enchanting symbols


The enchanting symbols shown on the enchantment selection contain random words using the standard galactic alphabet from Commander Keen games, but the words in enchanting tables are randomized and do not correlate with any enchantments. This language shows up in the 10th anniversary of Minecraft, as a puzzle.

### Sounds
#### Disc 11
When the ogg for music disc 11 is converted to wave and run through a spectrogram, an image is created. Several theories for this image exist, but the most popular is that the image depicts the default player head and C418's autograph. C is the hexadecimal of 12, so 12418 is C418.

- A portion of disc 11 when ran through a spectrogram. Some features have been distinguished. There are a main character's face and the number 12418.
- Another image of disc 11.
- A green version of the portion.
- The green version that has been highlighted for clarity.

#### Cave sound 14
The creeper face in the ambient sound 14 spectrogram
When ambient sound 14 is put into a spectrogram, it appears to be a creeper face.

#### Crimson forest ambience
Many of the sounds were created using balloons.[19]

### The killer bunny
The killer bunny is a variant of the rabbit that is hostile to all players. This is a reference to the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It can be spawned only by using commands, and only in Java Edition.

### 
In snapshot 13w36a for Java Edition 1.7.2, Dinnerbone added a Super Secret Settings button, which could be viewed in the options screen. Clicking it would blare a random game sound with a lower pitch and change the shader of the screen. These effects would not necessarily work on computers without a graphics card that supported OpenGL 2.1. This was removed in snapshot 15w31a for 1.9.

### Crash screens
Main article: Crash § Witty comments
When the game runs into a fatal error and crashes, the crash log includes a message such as "Who set us up the TNT?" or "Hi. I'm Minecraft, and I'm a crashaholic."

### .minecraft
#### Debug profile results
Debug profile results (triggered via /debug) contain witty comments at the top, much like with crash reports.

- Shiny numbers!
- Am I not running fast enough? :(
- I'm working as hard as I can!
- Will I ever be good enough for you? :(
- Speedy. Zooooom!
- Hello world
- 40% better than a crash report.
- Now with extra numbers
- Now with fewer numbers
- Now with the same numbers
- You should add flames to things, it makes them go faster!
- Do you feel the need for... optimization?
- *cracks redstone whip*
- Maybe if you treated it better then it'll have more motivation to work faster! Poor server.

### Scottish Steve and Swedish Alex

In Bedrock and Legacy Console editions, in the default skin pack or the legacy skin pack, the Scottish Steve and Swedish Alex skins are references to the locations of the companies developing the game. 4J Studios is located in Scotland, and Mojang is located in Sweden. These both can be used in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as alternate costumes for Steve.

### Item models

  

This section would benefit from the addition of more images. 
Please remove this notice once you've added  suitable images to the article.  The specific instructions are: Renders of Steve and Alex wearing the spyglass and the lightning rod.



Several items when worn on the head (using /item replace) have unique placements. The end rod and spyglass protrude from the head like a horn, the lightning rod sits at the side like a snorkel, fish look like an ear and mic piece, banners display similar to how raid captains wear them, fence gates are worn like glasses, bones are held in the mouth like a dog, leads go around the eye like a monocle, and feathers stick up at the back of the head.

### Command blocks
#### Searge
Running "Searge" as the command in the command block without a preceding "/" now sets the previous output to "#itzlipofutzli". This Easter egg is case insensitive.

#### autoexec.bat
In the language files for the key for the command block’s “Always Active” feature “advMode.mode.autoexec.bat”. A tribute to DOS based operating systems that made use of “AUTOEXEC.BAT” to run commands on startup of the system.
