- Again thanks to the eggs, cooked chicken can befarmed completely automatically, compared to farming of other animals which needs the player to breed the animals.

Disadvantages:
- Other meats restore more hunger and saturation than cooked chicken.
- Eggs hatch into baby chickens, which need time to grow before they are able to lay more eggs, or can be killed for meat.

- A bowl of stew requires both types of mushrooms, which is bad news if you only have one type.
- Mycelium, podzol and nylium aren't easy to find, the first two found in rare biomes, the third only found inthe Nether.
	- Even if these blocks are found, the player can't obtain them withoutSilk Touch.

Disadvantages:
- Like other stews, rabbit stew does not stack.
- A bowl of rabbit stew restores less hunger and saturation than all of its ingredients combined.

** Suspicious stew **
Restores *
Advantages:
- Flowers and mushrooms are easy to find.
- Restore 7.2 saturation.
- It's equivalent to amushroom stew, but with an extrastatus effectdepending on the flower used.  Even with the flower, it can still be crafted in the player's inventory.
- When crafted withblue orchidordandelion, suspicious stew grants the effectSaturationfor 7‌[JE  only]/6‌[BE  only]ticks (0.35/0.3 seconds), meaning an additional7 ()hunger and 14 saturation, for a total of13 ( × 6.5)hunger and 21.2 saturation.  While some of the saturation will likely be wasted, especially if the player was too hungry to begin with, the stew will at least raise the saturation to match the hunger gauge.
	- As long as the player has7 ()hunger, eating a single bowl of saturation suspicious stew will raise both hunger and saturation to full.
- When crafted with anoxeye daisy, it gives 8‌[JE  only]/6‌[BE  only]seconds ofRegenerationinstead, which heals, making it all but essential when/gamerule naturalRegenerationis turned off.
- Suspicious stew can also be made byusinga flower and then abowlon abrown mooshroom.
- Suspicious stew can be purchased from farmer villagers.
- When crafted with anazure bluet, it gives 8 seconds ofBlindness, the only way to get this effect in survival mode, and is required for theHow Did We Get Here?advancement.

Disadvantages:

- Suspicious stew can have negative effects too (Blindness,Poison,Weakness, or evenWither).
	- Remembering the correct flower for the recipe is important.
	- Once a suspicious stew is crafted, there is no indication to the nature of its effect.  This also applies to stew purchased from villagers.
	- The above points make it risky to eat any suspicious stew that you didn't craft yourself, thus its name.
