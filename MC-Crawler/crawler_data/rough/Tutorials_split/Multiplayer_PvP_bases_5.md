## IV: Underwater base
PROS

- Depending on construction, can be very hard to find, especially if in the middle of a big ocean
- Difficult to break in without drowning
- Unlimited protection from TNT

CONS

- Hard to construct without drowning
- Can be difficult to get in/out of
- Takes a fair amount of resources to build

Materials: fist, dry sponges, pickaxe (stone minimum) and torches if too far from the surface, (optional: pistons, buttons, redstone)

Building the base: First, obtain some sponges. Either raid them from an ocean monument, buy them from the shop, or steal them from another person. Then, go find an ocean. A really big ocean. Then, go to the bottom and place down three sugar cane in a stack. You'll be able to breathe when standing in the sugar cane. Begin building your base above ground under the water. Don't worry about draining it yet, just build what you want it to be. Go ahead and build more space than you think you'll need so that you won't have to expand and flood your base again. Once you have it completely built and sealed from the outside water, take those sponges and use them to drain out the inside of your base. You now have an underwater base!

To get out, you'll either have to use:

1. A simple trapdoor or door. Albeit insecure, it's the simplest way to get in and out and if you keep it hidden most players won't look for it and wood is similarly colored to dirt.
2. In the new updates, you can properly swim, which means you can fit through one-block-high gaps, and that way you can squeeze into a hidden opening. You can also use a trapdoor to keep it secure.
3. Nether transport. First, get enough obsidian and/or molding supplies to make two portals. Next, make sure there's no one in a 100-block radius of your base. Make a nether portal in your base and go through it. You then want to go about sixty-four blocks away from your location. Make another portal. Go through it, and back in the Overworld, cover it up using dirt, sand or something depending on the area to make a convincing, small hill. Go back through your portal and make a walkway to easily get between your portals. Go back through your sky portal and you'll end up back in your base.


An ocean monument can make a good underwater base. All you need to do is to clear out the water using sponges, eliminate all three elder guardians and you got yourself an easy base! Most people won't bother to check all the monuments because there are quite a few. Also, the guardians that spawn outside the ocean monument can act as a good shield against most basic players. However, certain players may try to enter due to the 8 gold blocks in the treasure room, which you should have already removed by this point. If you hear Guardians being damaged when you are not killing them, it is likely some players are trying the approach the monument. Shoot at them with bows to try and keep them away, and the combination of the guardians' beams, your arrows, and their drowning will either kill them or damage them enough that they will stay away.

If you do decide to build a base inside a monument, it is advised to place a massive roof (60×60) above the entire area (Preferably made of glass, and at block limit level 256 so to be less noticeable), so that the guardians spawn more often to defend you. Flooding any nearby caves in at least a 100×100 area will also help this.

If you really don't want your base to be defeated, you can choose to have no entrance, block up all the entrances and reinforce the weaker walls with 3 layers of obsidian, leave the elder guardians there, and enter only using /home or nether portals. This method is possibly the most effective out of all the bases, as it takes multiple days for even an experienced group of players to remove enough water for TNT to be an issue (if they don't remove enough water, the water will flood any area they attempt to blow up, undoing most of their work), and mining 3 layers of obsidian under the effects of mining fatigue III will take over thirty hours using a diamond pickaxe (257 hours using bare fists). This is just to destroy enough obsidian to fit a player through. Even with Efficiency V and Aqua Affinity, mining through will still take 1.5 hours. Nobody will bother to do this, especially when they're drowning underwater with a crowd of guardians firing lasers at them. Also, slab the entire area around your base, so that players cannot take breathing spaces by placing doors everywhere, and slabs don't clear enough water for players to breathe.

- The above method of making a base can actually be applied to all bases, and thus, made even safer. You can transport elder guardians using minecarts or boats to your bases in other locations, to prevent break-ins.
- The disadvantage to this method is that the mining fatigue can affect you too, so breaking blocks will be extremely slow for you as well. Drinking milk can prevent the effects for a short time, but that also means that raiders can do the same.

Underwater bases are great as they are entirely submerged into water, if any players want to grief it they have to either:

- Using sand or gravel to block off the water, then try to TNT cannon in (which will take a long time and will alert anyone nearby, who will come out and defend against the players)
- Ender pearling (which will still take a long time as ender pearls now obey normal physics and drop straight to the ground once entering water, and if you have your base completely sealed it won't be a problem).
- Using sponges to remove water and TNT cannon in (the same ending for situation 1), this method is actually worse than the sand/gravel method, because water sources regenerate and undo most of their work.
- Nether Transport (they can enter if they know how to do it, so break your nether-side portal when you're not using it and make sure to hide your portals well). Breaking the inside portal, contrary to common belief, will not deactivate the nether-side portal, and will cause a nether portal to spawn near/on the location of the inside portal.
- Find an entrance (which should be well enough hidden that they won't find it).
- The only thing you would somewhat have to worry about is multiple players attempting to enter at once, as the guardians' lasers are single-target attacks, and having too many attackers can kill the guardians faster. However, this should not be an issue if you read the above and set up the roof and gotten rid of caves, as if both of these are done, roughly 30 guardians should spawn per second (there is a mob limit still, so you'll only be able to have around 50 at once).
