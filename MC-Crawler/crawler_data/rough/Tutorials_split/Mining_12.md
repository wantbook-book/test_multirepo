## Nether mining
Mining in the Nether can be very profitable, because of netherite and nether quartz that can't be found elsewhere, as well as nether gold ore being abundant. However, the Nether is far more dangerous than the Overworld, and ancient debris is extremely rare.

### Needed equipment
As the nether is an extremely dangerous place, you will need a lot of good equipment, because this will make the endeavor a lot more profitable and safer. The list is in no specific order of importance.

- Pickaxe
	- It is good to have a diamond or netherite pickaxe, as although nether quartz ore and nether gold ore do not require any specific tier to mine, ancient debris does require at least diamond tier. A good enchantment to have, on top of the usualMending,Unbreaking,andEfficiency, isFortune, as opposed toSilk Touch, so that you can repair the pickaxe withexperiencegained from quartz and gold ore.
- Armor
	- It is good to have some sort of armor, with at least one piece being gold, to keep piglins from attacking you. Otherwise, it is good to have at least iron tier armor. As usually in the Nether,Fire Protectionis useful. While mining underground, ghasts won't be a threat, but if one is usingbedsorTNTto mine,Blast Protectioncan still be useful.
- Weapon
	- Weapons are good to have in any situation, but especially so in the nether. As usually, a sword of best material available with good enchantments is recommended; however,Fire Aspectwill be less useful in the Nether as many enemies are immune to fire damage, whileLootingcan be especially valuable. If atridentis used, it should haveLoyalty, as it can otherwise be hard to retrieve it in Nether's terrain.
- Food
	- Food is always important for survival, so keep quite a bit on you.
- Blocks
	- it is good to have blocks on you to be able to cross over large gaps, block any lava pockets you encounter, and tower up to hard to reach places.
- Fire Resistance potion
	- Fire resistance potions are a very useful safety precaution. In the case one would fall in a lava pit or be set on fire, one can drink the potion, which will negate all fire or lava damage. While not necessary, this item is very good to have.

### Mining nether quartz and gold
#### Exploration
When searching for nether quartz and gold, a good way to find a large amount is to just explore, as you wander the nether, you will come across lots of exposed nether quartz and gold ore, you can then mine it. This method is both fast and interesting, but also more dangerous, as compared to mining underground, there will be many hostile mobs, and it will be more likely to fall into lava pits. It is also almost impossible for netherite to generate exposed to air, so it cannot be found this way.

#### 
This type of mining can be done at any level, and will mostly get you the same amount of quartz and gold, but this method is a lot more bland, but safer, and can get you ancient debris. This method is done similarly to in the overworld, but is more dangerous as you will run into many little lava pockets.The best way to prevent this is carry a bucket right next to your pickaxe since you can only run into source blocks(if you’re in java, you’ll be able to put it in your offhand).

### Ancient debris
Ancient debris is used to make netherite. When ancient debris is smelted in a furnace or blast furnace, it becomes netherite scrap. 4 netherite scrap and 4 gold ingots can then be crafted into one netherite ingot. 

#### 
This method can be used for netherite, and if you are looking for netherite, it is best to do so between y=8 and y=22 as there is a higher concentration of ancient debris between these levels. The method is similar to in the Overworld, but because netherrack is easier to break than stone, it can be instant-mined. This allows for the player to maintain sprint while mining, making the process much faster than in the Overworld. However, the method is also somewhat dangerous, as one will run into many pockets of lava. For this reason, the player should have high-tier armor, possibly with Fire Resistance, and potions of Fire Resistance.

#### TNT mining
TNT mining is considered to be one of the best methods for finding ancient debris. Netherrack has a very low blast resistance, which means that TNT mining exposes more area in Nether than in Overworld, while ancient debris, unlike the ores found in Overworld, can't be blown up.

In TNT mining, a tunnel is created around y=15. Once the player has gone far enough, or ran out of TNT, they will go back along the tunnel, placing TNT on the floor every 5 blocks (that is, with 4 blocks between each one), until they get to the beginning, where they will light up the TNT, causing a chain reaction. In the resulting tunnel, there should be exposed ancient debris left intact by the explosions, that can be mined out.

Similarly to branch mining, this method will expose a lot of lava, which will often flow and fill large areas. However, the lava is easily avoided, and won't burn up the ancient debris. TNT mining is also a very expensive method, because for one stack of TNT, 5 stacks of gunpowder and 4 stacks of sand are needed.

A better method is to build world eaters. They are enormous bombing flying machine that will destroy everything under them. However, ancient debris are blast-proof, so a world eater will destroy everything and reveal ancient debris.

#### Bed mining
When a player tries to sleep in the Nether, the bed blows up. Bed mining is similar to TNT mining but instead of TNT, it uses this mechanic. While it has the same pros as TNT mining, beds have a larger explosion than TNT, but most importantly, they are less expensive, which makes them a very popular choice of method for finding ancient debris.

Beds do have the problem of having no fuse time before exploding, making it very likely for the player to take some damage.Furthermore, beds blowing up do not cause nearby beds to explode, meaning each one has to be manually blown up. Beds are also not stackable, which limits the maximum length of mining sessions considerably. This is partially negated by instead carrying wool and planks with you, which are crafted into beds as you go.
