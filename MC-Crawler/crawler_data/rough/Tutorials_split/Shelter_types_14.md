### Ravine Shelter
Description
A shelter situated in a ravine. Rooms may either overhang on the side or occupy the entire ravine. These are easier to build if the opening is close to (if not breaking) the surface, and more difficult if deep underground. Sometimes a ravine may spawn above another ravine, so you can use the lower as your shelter, and upper as your farm(s). 

Necessary Materials

- Torches
- Ladders
- Cobblestone
- Water

Location

In a Ravine

Construction
If there is lava on the bottom, freeze it with water. Any water/lava from the sides should be plugged. Make the floor flat, and then light up the ravine with as many torches as you can. Start the walls, and put in the items you want in the rooms (bedroom, craft room, furnace room, storeroom, minecart room). Rooms should be 3-4 blocks high (or if you're building a staircase, whichever suits the staircase best), and once all rooms are at the preferred height, build the next floor. Repeat until the house has as many rooms as you need.

You may want to seal off caves, but you don't have to smooth the walls. Farms can be easily built on the floor too. A glass floor would also look interesting.

Extras

- Surface additions
- Branch mine
- Tunnel
- Cobblestone generator
- Hidden cannons (among walls)
- Infinite water sources

### Castle
Description

A castle capable of keeping out an army of monsters

Necessary Materials

About 1000 blocks of your desired block, but you can exceed this limit if you want to.

Location

A large flat plains, a man-made flat area, or the world type Super-Flat. If needed use map editors, unless playing survival (legit)

Construction

Take the cobblestone and make a 3 block wide, 1 block long, and 1 block high base. Continue across until the length stretches all across your flat area. Then, clear out a 6 block long section for a primary entrance. Make the walls about 20 blocks high and make ladders or stairs leading up. Add an overhang to the walls to keep out spiders. Make shelters and useless buildings inside the walls. This should take about 3-7 nights, depending on size.

Extras

- Catacombs
- Castle forge
- Castle home
- Bed
- Treasury
- Castle mine
- Cannons to obliterate enemy siege weapons
- Hidden layer of obsidian inside the walls and towers to resist cannon fire
- Blocks on the outer layer of wall, covering every other slot as a reinforcement from spiders, every five blocks change the material to something else.
- Huge castle basement.
- Dungeons for prisoners that you're at war with. You'll need to be an admin to stop them usingspawnor/killto get out with/spawnpointcommand blocks (in fact, to make it a working escape-proof dungeon, you'll need so many command blocks you might as well make it the server jail while you're at it).
- Castle well
- Farms
- Execution block, something that kills you via fall, suffocation or other methods of destruction, to use on people (orvillagers) you don't like.

### Stronghold
Description

A castle built using a village with enough add-ons to become its own mass shelter. It can house many players and animals.

Necessary Materials

- Lots of cobblestone (1000–10,000)
- Water/Lava

Location

Any area with an NPC Village. The village will be a part of your home; keep that in mind.

Construction

Surround the village with cobblestone. Be sure to add gatehouses so you can enter and leave your stronghold. Optionally, leave room for some more structures in the village. 
When surrounding the village, create a two-layer wall of cobblestone. Make the inner layer one block smaller than the outer layer. This will allow you to snipe mobs outside the castle. 

Extras

- Granary to Store Food
- Quarry for Materials
- Armory for Weapons
- Extensions on NPC Blacksmith for Mass Smelting
- Modify the NPC Houses with extra furniture, beds, etc.
- Pistons to hold Water/Lava and release it when necessary

### Nether Shelter
Description

A shelter in the Nether.

Necessary Materials

Lots of cobblestone/obsidian.

Location

Nether, preferably next to your portal.

Safe construction

It is recommended to build a small shelter before you start any of your construction areas before starting to build your home, to ensure you won't get visited by "unexpected guests". If you build in the open, you can`t do this, but if you can you should.

Nether shelter types

1 - Cave home
Safest, because you build it safely away from ghasts and you are surrounded by walls. Making a nether cave home can prove much easier than building a similar home in the Overworld because you won't be attacked by mobs. The only mobs you will meet are zombified piglin which will not attack without reason. You should still be careful around them, though. You should also watch out occasional lava pools while digging away.

2 - Free-standing
Difficult, as you are going to be attacked by ghasts. Your walls must be made of cobblestone or any other block with a Blast Resistance of 4.2 or higher. Be prepared to fight at any time, except in peaceful mode.

3 - Fortress Home
This one is fairly easy: just find a nether fortress. Be careful, as fortresses will be hard to traverse. Be sure to clearly mark your designated "home" area, or spread your furniture around the entire building. Ghasts may or may not be a problem, depending on the location. Zombified piglin won't be an issue unless you attack them first. Magma cubes and blazes will likely not be too much of a threat.

 Windows 

A ghast cannot see you through glass. Thus, you can build windows in the Nether as long as you stay inside it is safe, to protect your self and your windows, you might want to use pistons to put some cobblestone in front of the window, which can be relocated by pressing a button. Allowing yourself to be inside the home safely and have a good view of the Nether. And when you go exploring you "close" the window, for in case you get hunted by a ghast.

Extras

- Treefarm (you'll have to usebone mealsince water cannot be placed in the nether)
- Mushroomfarm
