#### V - Z
- Village:Make your city like a normal ''Minecraft''villageand usevillagersas the residents. Seeherefor the full list of blueprints for the village structures. You can even create your own buildings related to the other village buildings. Be sure to keep iron golems around the village or else your village becomes a zombie village!

- Venice:Make your city have canals ofwaterorlavafor roads. Add bridges as well. Boats or Striders can be used for transportation, Also, if you use lava, avoid flammable materials in buildings.

- Vertical:Build a huge tower out of any material you want. Then, useladdersorscaffoldingsto travel across the city and make the buildings stick out of the tower. Make this tower tall and wide. You can also build this city underground, on the side of a cliff or a hole.

- Void:Either create asuperflatworld with the Void preset or build a city just like you normally would, but with the buildings floating over thevoidinThe End. A city like this is a dangerous place to live in, as the risk of falling into the void is constantly present.

- Zombie apocalypse:Make your city look like an apocalyptic city with ruined buildings everywhere. Make broken vehicles and fallentrees, addvinesor mossy versions ofstoneto the houses. Have various zombie types infesting the city.

### Transportation
You need a method of transportation for your city to get around. Here are some ideas:

- You could make a series of TNT launchers to work as elevators to higher levels of your city (remember to make with block resistant to explosions).

- Boats:If your metropolis is spread across several islands, then build a boat network. Have harbors at every island and make buoys in the water with signs directing people to other harbors. You can also have canals, but these might get in the way of your construction. Boats can also be used on land, moving especially fast on certain blocks. This is a great way to transport mobs!

- Command hub:High above the city, place a platform with command blocks on it. Thesecommand blockscan teleport the player to a new location with the press of a button. Label all the command blocks with signs. All the locations labeled on this platform should have their own command blocks teleporting the player back to the hub. It is also a fantastic place to place a community end portal, nether portal,elytralauncher, and other contraptions.

- Elytra:Create severalelytralaunchers, each withfireworks, and let people fly to wherever they want. Put the launchers in convenient places. You could also have some other transport system (like minecarts) to serve your city, but have a central airport in which you use elytra to get to other cities.

- Flying:This needs eithercommand blocksor an admin. Basically, have an "airport" where command blocks and/or an admin gives players spectator mode so they can fly from the new airport to another. Creative mode also gives players an ability to fly, but isn't recommended, as creative mode abilities can be easily abused.

- Flying machine:You can make a flying machine, or use Slime Block Machines.

- Mounts:Horses and Pigs! Build a stable to keep them in. You could create separate lanes on your roads, maybe marked with a slightly different material than your normal roadblock. At your gas stations sell saddles, horse armor, wheat, etc. Using adonkeyor amulealso works.

- Minecart:You can make a subway or overground railway to get people around. SeeTutorials/Train Stationfor more information. Set up ticket booths and charge people, allowing them to drive the minecarts once they pay. An interesting tactic to try out, if you want to have actual trains, is to automate the fare collection process and make people drive trains. An even more interesting way to do this is to have two minecarts be pushed by a furnace minecart on and off of powered/unpowered rails to create a great and automated system. Plus, you get to brag that you have a use for a furnace minecart.

- Sea roads:Build a small road across theoceansand usedolphinsto increase your speed!

- Teleporting:You can now createredstonecircuits which activate console commands withcommand blocks. Build "stations" with command blocks in them, which have the command " /tp @p <coordinates> " to teleport the nearest player to the command block to the specified coordinates. You could also have various chests withender pearlsinside.

- Walking:The most common way is by walking, so build wide roads out of stone and pavements out of stone slabs or other materials (See the Roads section below for more details). Rest stops are optional, but may be useful for players wishing to log off or stop for a moment without being attacked.

### Buildings and structures
#### A - D
- AcropolisIf you have an Ancient Greek city, find a hill, then permeate it with temples and religious complexes. You can build a ruined variation of this in a modern city, too.

- AirportBuild an airport and add a runway to "fly" planes off of. Most of the largest cities should have one. Some things to have in your airport include:
	- Baggage Claim: This is where players get their items after getting off their flight. You could have chest minecarts continuously go around a little track to imitate the conveyor belts where luggage is retrieved.
	- Security Checkpoint: Have a long line made withfencesleading to a body scanner and an ice conveyor belt that players put their items on. If you want, have a contraband list of things you cannot bring through security, likeTNT,firework stars,fire charges,lava buckets,swords,bows, andarrows, and use the clear inventory command to enforce.
	- Check-In: Where players can check-in their luggage and present their "boarding pass". This could be a piece ofpaperor something more valuable.
	- Food Court: Nobody wants to wait for a flight with an empty stomach. Have a large room with lots of tables and restaurants to get food from.
	- Departure/Arrival Gates: Where to wait for and board your flight. Have lots of benches and a desk. (SeeTutorials/Furniturefor furniture types.)
	- Runway and aircraft: You could usecommand blocks, two aircrafts in both the destination airport and the departure airport and a third aircraft in the air. Make the command blocks teleport players from the first aircraft to the aircraft in the air and after a few minutes, teleport the passengers to the requested destination airport. Build different types of aircraft classes. You could have windows in a non-moving airplane and using pistons, make blocks flash by as if the plane were moving. With slime blocks, you can also make afunctional aircraft.
	- You can build replicas of real-life planes, or design something completely new. In a more fantastic world, consider using airships instead of planes.
	- Ender pearl launcher: If you know how to make an ender pearl launcher, you can do that and allow your citizens to travel large distances.

- AmphitheatreBuild the half-stadium like theaters just like in Greece and Rome, and use it to hold plays, speeches, and even executions. Be sure to make it out of clean-looking stone material.

- Amusement parkYou can build roller coasters withminecartsandrails, ticket booths and small shops around the park, and a ferris wheel. You can make the park small or large. You could even build a water park! See alsoTutorials/Building a rollercoasterfor more tips.

- ApartmentsBuild a tall building out of bricks and fill it up with rooms with a single bed and small chest in each. People rent the rooms for whatever you are using as currency and can store their stuff there and sleep.

- Animal shelterThis is for pet owners (example: tame cats and wolves), that want to give their pet away. Maybe their wolf is  attacking people accidentally. Have cages and maybe a barnyard for the farm animals like horses. These animals are given shelter, food, and water until someone comes to get a new pet. You can sell the animals or give them away for free to whoever wants them. you could choose between making it a kill-free or a kill shelter. If you make it a kill shelter then you should have a certain timeline posted on a sign at the front of the building telling visitors how long you keep animals before killing them. You can do this manually, have a room devoted to killing, or possibly automate it. Expand the shelter and add more cages if you're not killing them, as the animals pile up more if you're not regaining space.

- AquariumBuild huge glass tanks and fill them with water,coral, water plants and, most importantly, animals, such assquidsand all kinds offish. You can even have hostile water monsters, likeguardians, in the aquarium, but if you have, be careful that they don't attack the visitors or other animals.

- AqueductsAqueducts are bridges for conveyingwateracross gaps such as valleys,riversorravines. Not only is it an aqueduct to supply your town with water, but you can also have a nautical highway.

- ArcadeBuild a building and make the walls out of colorful blocks and fill it with fake games made ofiron,paintings, andsigns. You could even get/make a resource pack or usemapsthat makes the painting "screens" look like real games!

- Archery rangeA place where people can practice their archery skills. Usetarget blocksfor normal targets, and if you want, you can havemobsridingminecartsfor moving targets.

- Area 51A place for admins to manage private matters. Make a small building far from the city and hire guards to kill intruders on sight. Add lots of rooms for top-secret projects and make sure there are no windows at all. Fill the interior with command blocks withleversandbuttonsattached, and useful notes. You may want to use illagers as guards.

- ArenaA player arena, a mob arena or both! . Have lighting, and mobspawn eggdispensers or mob spawners for the arena. Have plenty of temporary weapons for rent in the "arena store" or whatever you want to call it. Be creative.

- Armor & weapons shopUse the city's currency (e.g.emeralds,nether quartz,diamonds) to buy weapons and armor. Armorer and weaponsmith villagers could be placed here.

- Army OutpostA place where your army is held until they go to war. It may be built out of something strong to keep your army safe. You may keep the armor in it, as long as weapons and beds are inside for the army.
	- Barracks: A place where soldiers protect your outpost live.
	- Armory: A place where weapons andarmorare stored. This would be a building under heavy guard, with chests filled withswords,bows,arrows, and armor, all of the various tiers.
	- Guard tower: Put guards up here withbowsandarrows,swords, and sets ofarmor. Place these near the walls to protect the outpost.
	- Walls: Surround your outpost in a wall of strong material (likeobsidian) to prevent those with malicious intents from getting in. For extra security, you could place Guard Towers nearby to prevent people from scaling the walls.

- AuditoriumA place for people to gather and watch something, like a concert, speech, etc. It should be able to seat a lot of people. It can be placed in the Town Hall.

- BakeryMake a building with a baker (a player) who sellsbread,pumpkin pies, andcakes. Could be attached to the cake factory. Make apumpkin,wheat,chicken,cow, andsugar canefarm.

- BankPeople go here to store their money. Have a trusted person work there and have vaults deep underground to store theirgoldanddiamonds(you can also usedried kelp blocksto represent banknote or money stacks). Only let the trusted person and the owner of the vault into it. You can use piston doors on the vaults that need a special "key" (Lever). Variation: InJava Edition, use/data merge block ~ ~-1 ~ {Lock:"keyname"}when standing on a chest. Then, give a player an item named 'keyname' or whatever you typed in the command.

More complex version: Have people have a simple account by giving access to an ATM (ender chest). People can also send a request to have a personal vault underground by writing a book with their name and requested combination and putting it into a minecart with a chest along with their items, and sending theminecartinto the main facility. Then, the owner (withredstoneknowledge), can build a working vault with combo lock and message the player when they have finished, so the player can access their vault. NOTE: This method takes up a lot of space, build it preferably underground (Think Gringotts from "Harry Potter"!)
- BarMake a store that only sells negative-effectpotions, such as potions of Poison. You can make chairs,brewing stands, andnote blocksor other music generators. This can be combined with the dance floor to make a night club.

- Batting cagesMake a building , making it an ample size, such as 27 by 27 by 17. Spawn or transport aghastin the structure. Players can pay admission to practice deflecting the ghast fireballs back at the ghast. When the ghast is killed and the player leaves, spawn another ghast for the next player.

- BookstoreFill a shop withbookshelves. Have a librarianvillagerwork there and have authors write inbook and quillsto buy or borrow. Also, to make citizens happy, let them write their own books with book and quills.

- BreederMake an Industrial Farm and agricultural rooms withchickens,pigs, etc., and when necessary, kill them for meat.

- Butcher's shopMake a building with the front having a counter, and in the back havefurnacesto cook meat. Have a butchervillagerwork there and sell the meat. You could also have hunters to go hunt the meat for the butchers, again, just an idea. You could have an automatic furnace to cook food when you aren't there. You need 3hoppers, 1 furnace, 6 (or 3)chestsand 2levers.

- CampgroundSomewhere far from your city , you could make a campground! A campground is a place with many sized "campsites" that customers can set up "tents" (triangular structures made out ofwool) on. This is a good alternative to a large hotel, if you want to save time. On each campsite, don't forget to create a fire pit withlogs, enough space for at least a medium-sized tent. Building the campsite in a natural or artificial forest is a good idea.  Add agravelpath connecting the campsites, perhaps a shack for restrooms (completely optional), a lake or pond (if you're building bywater) and a playground. You could even make it in a State or National Park, if you don't want visitors cutting down trees forwood.

- Capture the flag arenaHave a 41 by 20 area split in the middle with a wall using pistons. Add 2chestswith 3 stacks of 20arrows. Also, have 3bows. Have 2trapped chestswith your "flag". If someone is shot, they are out. Have adispenserthat shootsfireworksconnecting to both trapped chests. The fireworks should be different. This lets people know who won. To make this, you'll need someredstoneknowledge. You'll need 20wool, 2 dispensers, 20 pistons, 4 trapped chests, 4chests, and a lot of redstone. Or, instead of just shooting people, you could have to kill them to get them out. You could use banners as flags.

- CasinoHave a big fancy building withminecartwith a chest slot machines (minecart in, random items out) orpigslot machines (using random pig movements.)

- CemeteryBuild a cemetery complex, Make tombstones and dig holes under them. You can placezombieorskeletonspawnersunder them if you have access to creative mode or cheats. You can also expand the cemetery by building an underground crypt.

- Cinema/theaterBuild a large building with a ticket counter and a hallway leading to the screen rooms. Have a food bar selling food and drinks. You can also have actors orpistonsandredstonemoving things about. There could be a dark cave under the seats for monster sound effects, or anote blockcircuit orjukeboxfor music. Consider having various screens of different sizes

- City/town hallThis is probably the first building players usually make when building a metropolis. Have a huge building for the mayor, the mayor's assistants, and the people in charge of certain things (such as law enforcement, health and welfare, ...) A good place to put this is the heart of your city. You can have an auditorium and the city's archives located in this building. You could even build a huge political complex around it with a secret service headquarters, embassies formobsor other cities or servers, and of course, parking for everyone.

- Clothes storeMake a lot ofleatherarmor,dyeit custom colors, and put it on armor stands forplayerstotrade. You could arrange by color, arrange it in outfits, or whatever other way you come up with. You can also sell other kinds of armor. To look extra authentic, either put thearmoronarmor stands, or add "models" by luring askeletonorzombieinto aglasscase and give it thearmor. If you are in creative mode, you can put a humanheadon as well to make them look more like humans. (If you are using the latter, you must give them name tags to prevent them from despawning.) Make sure that the people who are in your city can't release themonsters. For added safety, you can usebarriersinstead of glass.

- Cobblestone plantMake a factory that producescobblestoneby the thousands!

- Dance loungeHave a multi-colored blocks for a dance floor and use bright lighting (whatever you want to do with it). You'll have a blast! Havenote blocksandmusic discsfor the DJ to use.

- Department store/mallMake a huge building with many floors that sell different items. Have a floor for blocks,armor, food, and mob drops, etc., for different prices. In a mall, have each store in a separate room or stall.Stores could sell items ranging from materials to music discs, or various kinds of blocks and even mobs! A store might also provide a service such as a trading hall, repairing or enchanting items, building/landscaping for or looking after a customer's property or even just grinding.

- Scrap shop: Where players trade in beatenarmor, damaged tools and blocks they have no use for, then the owner sells them to people who can't afford full grade armor.

- Distribution eenter: This is where things can then be delivered to the place that requests them where they can be bought, to someone who requests them for a price, to a rest stop, or to a hotel. Delivery requires a delivery system. Chests store the things that are requested, and there are signs for the places that requested them, so that they are delivered to the right place. Things that are requested are stored here until delivered.

- DumpA place to place all your junk in, Place double chests in a small shack inside the dump where you can store your old tools and junk or add an area to place your useless blocks in. And when its full have workers collect the blocks and make them into something new or just destroy them. Put a few around the town for citizens to dispose of their useless junk.

- Dungeon arenaA dungeon that a player goes into to fight hostilemobs. You could go into theNetherand slay Nether Mobs and theWitherto find the end of the dungeon, a bunker containing a prize and a portal back to theOverworld.
