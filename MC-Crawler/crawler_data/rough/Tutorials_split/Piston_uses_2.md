### Dry docks
A dry dock can be made by reversing a Floodgate: instead of controlling the liquid, the player is controlling a solid. Place a piston facing upward in a 1 block deep pool of water and wire this piston to a lever. When a boat comes over the piston, flip the lever to raise the boat out of the water. This prevents the boat from being influenced by currents or being bumped.

As an upgrade, using soul sand for the parts that come in direct contact with the boat helps conserve its durability.

### Variable enchantment room
This design has three settings: low-level, medium-level, high-level. You can choose a level range depending on how much levels you have.

### Self-repairing structures
Self-repairing structures use a piston cobblestone generator to endlessly create blocks that get pushed into place by pistons. The following video shows how to create a cobblestone generator, a simple clock and connect it all together to push cobblestone.

The following video shows a bigger, self-generating floor. By removing some blocks the same machine can also generate a wall, as shown in the video.

Self-repairing structures are not limited to cobblestone, however, it is by far the easiest material to manipulate as its generation can be fully automated.

Pistons can push up to 12 blocks, which limits the scale of the structure. Pistons cannot push chests, note blocks, obsidian, bedrock, monster spawners, or furnaces, so these can be used to stop a line of blocks before the 12 block limit is reached.

Moving vehicles are a result of Java Edition 1.8 adding the capability to slime blocks and pistons, allowing adjacent blocks to attach to the slime block.

## Traps
### Disappearing floor trap




































Side view of retracted state.
Note: The piston is a sticky piston.
Note: You can use smooth stone or cobblestone instead of sand.




When triggered, the section of the floor is withdrawn from below the target. This design is best used inside to hide the pistons and circuitry.
This can easily be added to a tunnel. Under the floor, dig out a 2-block deep pit for each of the trap blocks you want to move. Mine out two blocks horizontally from each space where the trap floor goes and put a sticky piston at the back of each hole. In front of the sticky piston, replace the floor blocks (make sure that the trap block is the same as the regular floor blocks so as not to cause suspicion. In the space beneath the floor can be a long drop, lava, dispensers filled with arrows. For simplicity, we chose lava.

The floor trap when the pistons are activated. Players who activate the pressure plate often have no time to react.
Triggering this is best done with a pressure plate, however, this can be difficult to hide from other players. You need to wire the pressure plate to the input of a NOT-gate and the pistons to the output. A delay can be helpful to ensure the player is over the right blocks when the trap triggers, which can be accomplished by putting in redstone repeaters. Stone pressure plates triggers only when players or mobs walk over, whereas wooden pressure plates trigger also for dropped items. Metal pressure plates act differently still.
This trap is reset once the signal from the pressure plates is disabled. 

Alternatively, the pistons could be connected to a lever. This requires input from the player, but can be activated when the target is above the trap, which removes the need for a delay.

You could also use sand or gravel to make a refillable trap, as well. Make sure to hide the refilling station for secrecy!

If you think this is bad, feel free to revert to the previous "version".

### Hidden bridges
Like disappearing floors, but in reverse, hidden bridges show an impassible obstacle (usually lava or a long fall) to hinder other players or kill mobs. These bridges can be activated by lever to allow a player to cross, then deactivated on the other side or by a set delay, done by placing redstone repeaters and setting the second redstone torch to any four positions (Right clicking it).
Adding multiple repeaters can make a longer delay if necessary.

### Suffocation trap

When a piston moves a block into the same space, as the head of a mob or the player, the entity takes damage from suffocation. Tunnels work well for this type of trap because the area is small and can hide the components.

In a tunnel, mine out the ceiling an additional two blocks high. At the top of every part of the tunnel, place a sticky piston, then replace the ceiling with the same material used in the tunnel. This trap can be triggered in a number of ways, the simplest being a pressure plate or lever. If you choose to use a lever, this trap can also act as a door, because aggressive non-baby cannot enter. For this example, we use a pressure plate.

Since players are pushed into the nearest air pocket to avoid suffocation, the trigger should be in the middle of a series. To ensure the trap doesn't reset too early, add an RS-NOR latch that is either reset manually or by an automatic delay.

You can also make a piston door, mine two blocks down and place a slab on the bottom block(s), so the thief or griefer who activates it can't escape, but can still be suffocated.
