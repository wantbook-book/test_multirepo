## Anti-griefing tips
### How to prevent griefing as a player
Griefing is difficult to prevent and virtually impossible to avoid on anarchy servers, but as a normal player, you can take steps to make your base harder to find, and ultimately, harder to grief.

- Remember that the more people that know about your base, the more likely it is that it can be griefed due to people sharing the coordinates to a potential griefer.
- Building far away fromspawnwill make your base harder to find. Also, do not build near any major roads or highways.
- Making the base out ofblast-resistant, nonflammable materials (such asconcrete) will make your base tougher, though dedicated griefers will probably have enough explosives to do a sizable amount ofdamage.
- Hidden, underground bases can be useful if you never want to be found.
- If you see your base or another base being griefed, record the griefer and report it to the server owners.
- Useender chests. Ender chests, while expensive early on, have a differentinventoryfor each player, meaning that no one else can access your ender chest. Storing items inshulker boxesand storing them in your ender chest will drastically increase your available inventory space.
- Build in the nether.
- To slow down hackers if you have an underground base, cover it in lava (make it look natural!) and limit how many storage items you have.
- To combat a griefer, try adding traps to your base, and hide your chest of valubles.
- Make your house look like a noobs'. Most griefers care about diamonds and other stuff, so make a 2" dirt house and just hide your good things underground.
- Never be intimidated by a griefer's threats. If you see a griefing happen and the griefer tells you to stay shut, still tell the admins. The griefer will probably be banned, and even if they get payback, it's better that your diamonds are stolen than 20 other players'. Be considerate for your fellow players.

### How to prevent griefing as a server owner
While there is not much that can stop a determined griefer, there are ways for a server to mitigate the risks of being griefed. The following is a list of steps server owners can take to try to keep their server protected:

- Protect the server with appropriate anti-griefing plugins.
- Do not let administrators abuse their power (this can incite anger in users and bring about griefing). Also, be cautious in choosing who to give administrative permissions, to begin with.
- Ban certain items in Bukkit, like Flint and Steel or Fire.
- Should power abuse happen constantly or in severe cases, it may be a wise idea to be the only administrator.
- Be careful what permissions to which people have access. Owners can limit access withServer modifications.
- Be careful where the server is advertised. While more exposure means more members, it also means griefers can find it just as easily.
- Become familiar with what griefers are capable of doing. There are no hacks "to gain op" or "delete the server". If one takes the time to learn what is possible (by watching griefing videos and reading griefing forums), you will be more able to counter it.
- Change servers so that only you or people you trust (in real life, since all you know about people you meet online is what they tell you) can do big things (such as banning other players).
- Use whitelists to only allow people you trust on the server.

### Server modifications
While there are many people creating grief-friendly client modifications, there are equally dedicated programmers creating server plugins to foil their attempts. Using the popular and extensible Bukkit server software and other Server Mods, programmers have made numerous add-ons to enforce correct client behavior. There are plugins that allow administrators to log and rollback all edits done on an individual basis, employ jails to trap griefers, and even protect certain blocks or entire chunks.
