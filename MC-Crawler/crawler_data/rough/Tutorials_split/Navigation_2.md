## Marine navigation
Here are some helpful tips to avoid getting lost in the middle of large oceans.

- Maps: Very useful in navigating large oceans. Zoom them out to avoid ending up with an entire map covered in blue.
- Jack-o-Lanterns: Can be placed underwater and oriented to show the direction home.
- Lily pads: Can be placed down to form a trail. Can also be used to make small lava islands. Place the lily pad, then use a lava bucket on top of it. This forms a stone island with flowing lava. If you remove the lava, the island can be used as a mini-base, having enough space for achest,crafting table, and even abed.
- Towers: Built from the seafloor to well above the surface, and topped with a light source. Glass blocks or panes also carry light into the depths.
- Additionally, consider shaping the waterways, adding canals, and/or constructing a lighthouse to show the way to shore.

## Block Orientation
Many blocks are placed at a fixed orientation. Knowing this, it is possible to use the textures on the top faces of the blocks to orientate oneself without a compass. Note that actual block design may vary with resource packs.
