### Dyes
Avoid killing sheep for their wool. You get more wool if you shear them instead. If you're really using a lot of colored wool, you can dye sheep in the colors you use a lot... but keep the others white, for easy stacking and sale of your surplus wool. Instead of keeping a complete rainbow flock and stocks of 16 kinds of wool, just stock the dyes. Then if you sometimes need a little wool in other colors, you can dye batches manually—all the dyes are fairly easy to get hands on in decent quantity. 

### Enchantments
Enchanted items provide a variety of benefits over standard ones. While high-level enchantments on anything but diamond and netherite items may not be worth it in terms of longevity/effectiveness, for some of the most valuable enchantments it actually doesn't matter.

If for a certain attempt the enchanting table isn't offering Fortune III or Looting III (some powerful enchantments to have around) on a diamond tool, try an iron one and you might have better luck (due to higher enchantability), and then you least have something that can help you duplicate important blocks/items just as well as diamond. The effort needed to gain level 1–5 or so is trivial, and so you might consider even putting low-level enchantments even on your expendable tools.

### Ender chest
- If you have access to aSilk Touchpickaxe, andblaze rods, carryender chestswith you at all times. You can put your lifesaver items (a stack of wood, food, iron) and use the rest of the space as extra inventory space (if you find a cave, temple, or if you die inlavaand lose all your things).
- Even withoutSilk Touchit's possible to use anender chestto help transport items from storage in your mine to your main base. However, every time you move your ender chest, it costs oneeye of enderto craft it again.

### Ender pearls
Once you have collected sufficiently large numbers, ender pearls are useful for moving long distances quickly. It's best to combine them with enchanted armor – particularly boots of Feather Falling – or the accumulated fall damage adds up and kills you.

### Flint and steel
- Although this may seem cruel, by using aflint and steelto set"passive" mobson fire, you can kill and cook them in one operation without needing to spend extra time putting the meat in a furnace, collecting fuel and so on. This is a significant time-saver. One flint and steel is good for tens of mobs, possibly hundreds if they are crowded closely together. This also works with Fire Aspect swords; a diamond sword is enough to cook over 20 stacks of meat. If you don't have a diamond sword, then use the flint and steel like this: (this may be a bit tricky; also requires wolves) light the block below the animal, then aim up swiftly and hit it to cause the wolves to attack it, saving timeandgiving you both cooked meatandexperience.
- Fire is also a quick way of removing unwanted flammable items. Thus, if you are making an expendable temporary structure, consider building it out of leaves or wood to make it quicker to remove later. This works best in Hard mode, because fire spreads faster and is more destructive than in other modes. Fire is also useful to prime TNT without redstone.

### Flooring
- When creating large floors or roads, use slabs of whatever material you are working with. This doubles the amount of area you can cover with a certain amount of material, and slabs can be placed upon just as normal blocks are. As an added bonus, mobs don't spawn on slabs in the lower half of a block.
- Slabs floors can also be useful for creating the right height necessary to see out of slab window slots, for hunting at night.

### Furnaces
- Furnacesare cheap to make, and it is much quicker to process large quantities of material in parallel, so don't build just one furnace, build lots, and use them all at once.
- In the early stages of your world, putting down a furnace to smelt ores or cook food while you gather materials nearby can help save time.
- When smelting items – assuming you use coal or charcoal as a fuel – always try to add items to the furnace in multiples of eight. This avoids wasting fuel. If you really need to smelt less than eight of an item, use a furnace fueled with wooden planks, sticks or saplings. Two saplings or sticks smelt one item; two planks smelt three.
- You should always keep plenty of fuel in your furnaces so that you don't have to refill them every time you need to smelt something.
- Withhopper-fed furnaces, add a switch to deactivate the top hopper. That way you can queue up a great many different items and smelt them all at once, reducing the need to gather by everything 8 times.
- If you made one, keep your first wooden pickaxe (you can damage as much as you want) so you can put it in a furnace to cook one item.
- If you are out of coal and there are no coal mines nearby, cook a log in the furnace (not as a coal substitute, but in the top box) to get charcoal, which works exactly like coal.
- While charcoal is a good way to make torches without coal and when created using wooden planks as fuel is the cheapest wood fuel source available, the additional time and hassle of creating the charcoal may not be worthwhile when just using wood planks as fuel is around 15% less efficient and saves both smelting time as well as time spent tending the furnace.
- Later in the game, you may want to use blaze rods as fuel: a blaze farm can produce more than you would ever need and they burn 50% longer. This way you simply mine a bit of coal, or smelt logs for charcoal, every now and then for torches.
- Blast furnacesandsmokerscan be used to smelt ores and food 2 times faster than a normal furnace respectively, but keep in mind that they can't smelt cobblestone, sand, cactus, clay or other general things.
