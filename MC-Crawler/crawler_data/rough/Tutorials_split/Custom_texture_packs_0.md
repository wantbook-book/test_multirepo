## Extraction
The original textures are located in the game Java Archive file minecraft.jar. Any zip archiver should be able to extract files from it as the Java Archive format is just a subset of the common zip format. The exact procedure for locating the game archive and extracting the files from it varies by the operating system. Below is a list of files and subfolders of interest while creating a new texture pack:

### Windows
To extract the editable files for a texture pack, first download a compression program, such as 7-Zip or WinRAR, and make a folder on your desktop for texture pack storage. For Windows Vista/7, go to the "start" menu on your desktop and search %appdata%. On Windows XP, go to "start" menu, click "run", and type in %appdata%. There may be a file called roaming, if so open it, and one of the folders inside should be called .minecraft, unless the roaming folder was not existent. Open this, and inside open the folder titled bin. (If you have a newer launcher there may not be a bin file. If that is so just open the folder versions and select the newest version's folder) Then go to the minecraft.jar file or a file with the current version with .jar at the end (for example, 1.11.2.jar) and right-click on it. In the menu of options should be either "7-Zip" or "WinRAR". Follow the arrow from that option to the menu of actions, and choose "Extract to 'Minecraft/'". (It is best that your folder for texture packs have the word Minecraft in it. For example, mine is "Minecraft-desktop"). Find the extracted files. They should have been extracted to your desktop folder and be in a sub-folder titled "Minecraft". Open this file, and there will be 1,335 .class files. Delete every one of these. An easy way to select them all is to type .class in the search bar and press ctrl+A then delete (be sure not to delete the "splash" file, which will be selected because of the splash 'best in class). Now you are ready to edit. 

- Note: Microsoft Paint ("Paint" on theWindows Start menu) does not support saving transparent PNG files, any "blank" areas will simply come out as white, and MS Paint is therefore not recommended for this.
