### Evoker
Evokers have 24 × 12 HP like vindicators, but have a more unconventional fighting style. When within a 16-block radius, they summon a row of evocation fangs that bypass armor and shields, and when cornered, they summon a ring of said fangs instead. Evokers may also summon three vexes to join the fight, and flee at the player’s sprinting speed when cornered.

- Whenever possible, kill evokers upon sight as quickly as you can so that they won't have the chance to summon vexes or their fangs. This is especially important, since evokers cast their summoning spells upon being attacked inside most areas of a woodland mansion.
- Shooting them with a ranged weapon is the safest way to defeat an evoker, but keep your distance if the evoker senses that you're close, it has a chance to summon evoker fangs or vexes, which can be a nasty trouble for you. Try to get a Power 1-5 bow or you can enchant your bow with flame so the evoker can die in 1 hit, but if you see the evoker preparing to summon fangs or vexes, kill it immediately.
- Melee combat is also possible; corner the evoker into a small space while dodging any fangs that come your way, before striking repeatedly until it dies.
- Upon death, evokers drop theirTotem of Undyingas well as 0-1 emeralds, which can be good for later survival and trading.
- Evokers can walk as fast as the player's sprinting speed, so be sure to keep some food in your hotbar when you see one. If it flees, you can lose track of it if your hunger bar gets too low and cannot sprint.
- Bring a blue sheep and a few blue dyes so the evoker can focus on turning the blue sheep red, giving you time to finish the evoker. The evoker also have a cooldown before it can summon anything else.

### Vex
Summoned by evokers, vexes can fly through walls and floors to attack their target by surprise. Despite their low health pool, they deal up to 13 × 6.5 damage on Hard difficulty, meaning that they’re not to be trifled with.

- Time your hits well against vexes, and retreat if necessary to avoid getting struck.
- Use your shield to block any attacks since vexes are hard to hit with their small size and they retreat for a few seconds after attacking.
- Against a swarm of vexes, just flee from the scene and ignore them; they drop nothing when killed anyway and despawn within 2 minutes.

## General Strategy
Most people do this strategy when raiding the woodland mansion.
Bring all your things with you and don't forget your ender chest containing your shulker boxes. When you enter the mansion, start illuminating it. Kill any hostile mobs you see. When you are looting a room, kill all hostile mobs and light the room up. Take all the furniture and loot because they will be useful later. This will also remind you that you have raided this room. 

You can also mark the entrance if you don't want the furniture. Punch holes in the walls to check for secret rooms. If you find loot and your inventory gets full, open your ender chest and take out a shulker box to store your loot. Quickly put the shulker box in the ender chest so you don't risk losing it. Repeat for the other rooms. On the second floor and third floor, there are evokers, which summon vexes. Kill them first by sniping or cornering them. If your sword has Knockback, it is unrecommended to attack an evoker with it because you will knock it away and it can sprint as fast as the player. Once the evoker is dead, kill the vindicators and take the loot and furniture. 

Again, punch holes in the walls to check for secret rooms. Some rooms are more dangerous than others and the loot and furniture are different, such as the conference rooms, where five vindicators and one evoker generates within. If you take all the loot and furniture, you will gain a lot of useful resources. Aside from the woodland mansion chest loot, you will get a lot of mob drops, carpets, stairs and slabs from furniture, bookshelves, flowerpots, flowers, banners, cauldrons, chests, blocks of diamond and lapis lazuli, cobblestone, redstone, iron doors, dirt, wheat, seeds, melons, pumpkins, and dark oak saplings. Even those things aren't much value, they are worth taking because they can save you some resources. There are also many alternative strategies to loot a woodland mansion, it is based on personal preference.

## Alternative strategies for defeat
### Melee Warfare
Required Items:

- Fairly good fighting skills

Procedure:
Using a  sword or  bow, attack the illagers head on. Take down the mansion room by room, and punch holes in the walls to look for secret rooms.

### Water Defense
Required Items:

- Water bucket

Procedure:
When a vindicator spots you, apply the water bucket right underneath you to make a water pool. Stand in the water and hit the vindicators with your sword, as they will have a very hard time getting to you, since they cannot go to you while the water is flowing towards them.

### Arrows from Above
Required Items:

- Boworcrossbow(preferably enchanted)
- Arrows(several stacks / useInfinity)
- Water bucket
- Anaxe

Procedure:
Climb to the top of the mansion where you’ll set up camp. From there, destroy the roof and whip out your ranged weapon of choice to shoot any illagers from above, room-by-room. After clearing a loot room containing illagers, use your water bucket to head downwards, extract the loot and head to the roof again for more shooting. This method is great in the sense that all secret rooms are guaranteed to be uncovered.
