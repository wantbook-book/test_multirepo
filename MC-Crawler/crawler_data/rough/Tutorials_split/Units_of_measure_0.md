## Time
To convert time in Minecraft to time in real life, simply divide by 72. To do the reverse, multiply by 72. To measure ticks in Minecraft, multiply the real time (seconds) by 20 (this doesn't factor in lag and assumes a constant 20tps).

| Minecraft Time         | Real Time                 | Ticks         |
|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| 3.6 seconds            | = 0.05 seconds            | = 1           |
| 1 minute               | ≈ 0.83 seconds            | ≈ 17          |
| 1.2 minutes            | = 1 second                | = 20          |
| 1 hour                 | = 50 seconds              | = 1,000       |
| 1.2 hours              | = 1 minute                | = 1,200       |
| 1 day                  | = 20 minutes              | = 24,000      |
| 3 days                 | = 1 hour                  | = 72,000      |
| 1 week                 | ≈ 2.33 hours              | = 168,000     |
| 1 lunar cycle (8 days) | ≈ 2.67 hours              | = 192,000     |
| 1 month (30 days)      | = 10 hours                | = 720,000     |
| 72 days                | = 1 day                   | = 1,728,000   |
| 1 year (365 days)      | ≈ 5.07 days               | = 8,760,000   |
| 504 days (1.38 years)  | = 1 week                  | = 12,096,000  |
| 2160 days (5.92 years) | = 1 month                 | = 51,840,000  |
| 1 decade               | ≈ 50.69 days ≈ 7.22 weeks | = 87,600,000  |
| 72 years (26280 days)  | = 1 year                  | = 630,720,000 |
| 1 century              | ≈ 1.39 years              | = 876,000,000 |

## Amount of items
1 item is the most basic measurement in quantity.

- 1 block = 9 items. Used for resources that can be crafted into storage blocks and back (most kinds of processedminerals,slimeballs,bone meal,melon slices,wheat,dried kelp)
- 1 stack = 64 items = 7 blocks, 1 item. Note that some items like banners, signs, eggs, and ender pearls only stack to 16. So if someone says they have a stack of eggs, they have 16. For unstackable items, a stack is just 1.

One stack of a fully-stackable material (e.g.stone,diamond) will fully occupy one slot in one'sinventory.
- 1 fullhopper= 5 stacks = 320 items.
- 1 stack of blocks = 9 stacks = 576 items when completely uncrafted.
- 1 fulldispenserordropper= 9 stacks = 576 items.
- Mining capacity of an unenchanteddiamond pickaxe= 24 stacks 25 items = 1561 items.
- 1 fullchest= 27 slots or 27 stacks = 1,728 items.
- Mining capacity of an unenchanted netherite pickaxe = 31 stacks 47 items = 2031 items
- 1 inventory = 37 stacks = 2,368 items, when the offhand is included.
- 1 full double chest = 2 chestfuls = 54 stacks = 3,456 items.
	- Note: The phrase "double chest" is often shortened to "dub"; e.g. "a dub of cobblestone", meaning 54 stacks.
- 1 chestful ofshulker boxes= 27 chestfuls = 729 stacks = 46,656 items.
- 1 double-chestful ofshulker boxes= 54 chestfuls = 1458 stacks = 93,312 items.

## Health
Main article: Health
The basic measure of health is one health point (1). One heart (2) is also commonly used when talking about health.

## Hunger
Main article: Hunger
Similarly, the basic unit in hunger is a food point—1 ()—displayed as a chicken drumstick.

A full hunger bar (20 ( × 10)) contains 20 food points.

Additionally there are another 20 saturation points, which are invisible but are used when performing actions before hunger, so the maximum value is 40.

## Speed
Main article: Player § Movement
## Distance
Minecraft's worlds are a voxel grid where each block represents a voxel which is one cubic meter (1m3).

Knowing that one block is one cubic meter, we can derive that:

### Metric units
| Unit Desgination | Blocks        | Pixels       |
|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1 Terameter      | 1e12 blocks   | 16e12 pixels |
| 1 Gigameter      | 1e09 blocks   | 16e09 pixels |
| 1 Megameter      | 1e06 blocks   | 16e06 pixels |
| 1 Kilometer      | 1000 blocks   | 16000 pixels |
| 1 Hectometer     | 100 blocks    | 1600 pixels  |
| 1 Decameter      | 10 blocks     | 160 pixels   |
| 1 Meter          | 1 block       | 16 pixels    |
| 1 Decimeter      | 0.1 blocks    | 1.6 pixels   |
| 1 Centimeter     | 0.01 blocks   | 0.16 pixels  |
| 1 Millimeter     | 0.001 blocks  | 0.016 pixels |
| 6.25 cm          | 0.0625 blocks | 1 pixel      |
| 62.5 cm          | 0.625 blocks  | 10 pixels    |
| 6.25 m           | 6.25 blocks   | 100 pixels   |

| Blocks  | Volume      |
|---------|-------------|
| 1 block | 1 m3        |
| 1 block | 1000 liters |

- Note that a water block is 0.9 m3because it is 0.9 meters high.
