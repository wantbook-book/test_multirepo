## Backgrounds
### Dirt backgrounds
In Java Edition, a dirt textured background is used in most menus, on loading screens, and in the credits.


In Bedrock Edition, dirt backgrounds only appear in the credits and on the loading screen when teleporting to the Overworld using a nether portal.


Despite the texture of dirt being changed in Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 5 and Pocket Edition v0.2.0 alpha, the dirt backgrounds still use the old texture, except the dirt background when teleporting to the Overworld.‌[Bedrock Edition  only][1]
