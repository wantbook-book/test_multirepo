### Infiltration
Required Items

- Potion of Invisibility

Procedure:

A vindicator trapped with dirt blocks by the player under the effects of invisibility.
Enter the mansion invisible. Trap illagers you see in blocks, making sure that you don’t come too close as they might notice you.

### Raid Squad
Required Items

- Other players with regular supplies

Procedure:
There are many different ways to raid a mansion in a group. It’s easiest to go full-on “Melee Warfare” with a team, though more organized players might assign roles for each teammate (e.g. melee fighter, sniper, potion lobber, etc.) before heading in.

### Wolf Army
Required Items

- A pack of tamedwolves(the more the better)
- Extra meat to heal the wolves, preferably a stack of cooked meat of any type.

Procedure:
Use regular stategies to go about raiding the mansion. Your wolves will serve as your guardians and increase your survivability. Make sure you heal them after defeating an illager or some illagers in a room. 

### 
Required Items

- 5+name tags
- Invisibility potions

Procedure:
Name vindicators "Johnny" such that they attack other hostile mobs in the mansion, which will make your raid much more pleasant. Invisibility potions reduce the likelihood of the vindicators noticing you as you name them, but you can charge up to them from behind and name them, then run.

### Mass destruction
Equipment

- SomeTNT
- Flint and steel

Procedure:
It’s simple as blowing up parts of the mansion to destroy illagers, or burning everything away to reveal hidden chests. Just stay away from fires and explosion, of course! Don't do this if you want to keep the mansion as your base.

## Dangerous rooms
- Spider room: There is a spider spawner in the center of the room. Kill all spiders in the room and light up the spawner. Take all the cobwebs with shears because they are strictly limited in aMinecraftworld.
- Obsidian room: There is a diamond block in the middle of a obsidian pile. Mine the obsidian with a diamond or better pickaxe and take the diamond block.
- Jails: There are many vindicators in the jails. Kill all of them and break the iron doors. Take the cauldron and brown carpets because cauldrons are expensive to make. Free theallaysif possible as well.
- Bedrooms: There are many vindicators, except in the master bedroom. Kill all of them and take the wool and carpet from the beds. The loft on one of the master bedrooms has a chest next to the bed.
- Fake End Portal room: There is a trapped chest next to two tnt. Destroy the tnt and take the trapped chest and the ender pearls. Destroy the wool end portal because you cannot use it as a real one. The stone blocks are infested, so be careful. If you want to remove them, break one and kill all silverfish, or use silk touch to mine them.
- Illager statue room: There is a large illager wool statue holding a torch in one of its hand with a block of lapis lazuli inside its head. Light the room up with light source blocks and seal the entrance, one block above the ground with a horizontal row of blocks. Destroy the statue and collect the wool and the block of lapis lazuli.
- Dining rooms: The small and medium don't have illagers. Take all the furniture. The large dining room has an evoker and 2 vindicators. Kill the evoker by sniping it to avoid vexes. Kill the vindicators using a sword or by shooting them.
- Conference room: This is the most dangerous room, containing 5 vindicators and an evoker. Kill the evoker as fast as possible before killing the vindicators. You can pillar jump a few blocks (2 or 3 blocks) after defeating the evoker to avoid being hit by the vindicators. Take the furniture when you are done.
- Map room: This room has 2 vindicators and an evoker. Fight them using the methods described in the conference room. Take the illagers' carpet map, table and bookshelves.
- Arena room: This room has no illagers, but it is dangerous because you can be surprised by monsters from the top loft. Start by lighting the room with any light source blocks. Destroy the center arena and kill the mobs in there. Then, pillar up a few blocks to snipe at the monsters in the loft. Be careful of skeletons and have your shield ready. If you see a creeper, immediately retreat. Kill it using your bow. Build a bridge to the loft or climb the ladder. There is a loot chest.
- Lava room: This room has lava surrounding a diamond block and the lava is in a glass cage surround partially by obsidian. Loot this room last because there is high risk of fire. Start by mining the top obsidian. Break one piece of glass on the top of the cage and quickly pour water to cover the lava. Extinguish any fires you set. Break all the glass and convert the first layer of lava to obsidian. Lower the water source and mine the obsidian. The next layer would have turned to obsidian. Repeat for the other layers. Take the diamond block when you are done removing the lava and extinguish all fires.
