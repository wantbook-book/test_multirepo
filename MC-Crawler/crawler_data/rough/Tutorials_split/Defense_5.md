#### Endermen
Since endermen can move blocks, but are hurt by water, make a moat instead of a wall. Also, it's better if it flows through a 1×1 block hole in your house, so you get the drops. However, note that endermen can teleport onto the other side of the moat, making this method not as effective.

#### Players
** Basic Redstone Defenses **
A drawbridge is a very effective entrance mechanism for a multiplayer base. It works better if within faction land so that it can't be destroyed.

1. Create a 8×8×8 pit next to your walls, then fill the bottom layer withlava.
2. Build a 4 wide, 8 long bridge over the pit, with one high blocks at each side.
3. Remove the floor of the bridge and placetrapdoorsinstead, attached to the side barriers.
4. Place redstone all the way along the top of the barriers.
5. Place blocks one level above the redstone, so that players cannot jump onto the sides.
6. Link the two lines of redstone at alever.

Pull the lever to open the drawbridge, not letting anything in; or close it so you and your faction can get out.

Spiders can't jump the bridge, players will fall in the lava, and zombies and other mobs cannot cross it, unless it is left closed. So, it pretty much keeps everything out, as long as it is built on faction land.

Another effective trap against enemy players is sometimes known as the "KILL" land mine. Place an upwards-facing dispenser, filled with splash potion of Harming VII, surrounded by pressure plates. This is most effective if there is a ceiling above, so that the player can't run or walk out of range as easily. However, note that splash potion of Harming VII cannot be obtained without item spawning (in multiplayer) or mods. What you can do is use a lower Harming potion that is obtainable in survival, but it won't kill the player instantly.

One of the most cost-effective ways of base protection, especially against players, is camouflaging. Build your base under the ground or high up in the sky, so that it would be hard for players to find it.

** Advanced defense mechanisms **
A more advanced defense mechanisms is to make a fake base to mislead players. See the following steps for how to make one:

1. Build a hidden base, preferably underground and sealed off withsticky pistons. This is the real base; store all your valuables here and make all the important rooms (crafting rooms, storage rooms, etc.) inside this base.
2. Find a flat piece of land around 20-100 blocks away from the your real base's entrance. (If no flat area is available, find whatever comes closest and flatten that out).
3. Build a base (a castle-like structure or a village-like one) in this area. If possible, make it a very defensive-looking base, for defending yourself and to keep your enemies out of your actual base.

Though it is best on faction servers, cannons loaded with TNT, potions, or arrows are very fun to use and can do a lot of damage. Keep in mind that TNT will damage terrain, and that an incorrectly-built TNT cannon may blow up your house. There are many designs of TNT cannons you can use. Plus, with slime blocks, you can make them cheaper than ever.[verify]

Optional features:

- A secret tunnel from the fortress or fake base to your real base, sealed off with apistonhatch ordoorat the entrance to the fortress, only operated from the inside (the side of the real base)
- Moats, traps and/or sniping towers around. For towers, make sure they are only accessible from your own base(s)
- A fortress-destruct button at the real base (in case it gets overrun by enemies and you have fled into your real base) to get rid yourself of the foes

Lastly, if your real base is found as well, you do not want to be lost completely. That is why you should always have both a regular storage room as well as a secret one. In the regular one, put items such as iron armor/swords, food, bows and arrows, and building blocks. You could also put a little diamond stuff to stop the attackers from getting suspicious. Then, also build a secret room, with sticky pistons and only open or closable from the inside of it, where you put your really valuable stuff (diamond armor, enchantment table, potions, anvil, diamonds, diamond swords, enchanted bows, etc.)

NEVER allow any member of your faction (provided that you are playing on a faction server) to see this secret room unless you really trust and/or know them. This is because most of the PvP (player vs player) servers with griefing allowed are riddled with traitors and disloyal people who will take your valuables the moment you turn your back on them.

A useful way to protect your valuable items can be found on Tutorials/Traps.

#### Mob Defenses
Mob defenses can be effective, when using the right mobs. The mobs you can use for this are iron golems, snow golems, tamed wolves, or tamed cats. Also, the fact that these do not affect the player (with the exception of an annoyed iron golem or wolves turning on you, if you manage to attack yourself) makes these defenses a little more useful.

** Iron golems **
The best way to use these is keep them in an enclosed space with a door operable by lever. If invading mobs get too close for comfort, you can flick the lever and release the golems to clear the area. Alternatively, you can simply leave them wandering free in a walled-off area.

** Snow golems **
The most efficient way to use snow golems is in a one block wide tunnel. The snowballs from the golems cause no damage (except to blazes), but push mobs back. This can be used to push mobs into lava or something else that damages them, such as cactus. It can also simply be used to delay hostiles.

Placing snow golems in fenced-off "watch towers" may help protect you from hostile mobs as, the mobs will then attack the snow golems, and snow golems snow balls push away hostile mobs.

When using snow golems, make sure you protect the golems from the rain or they will die. Also, as mentioned on the snow golem page, they will take damage in a desert or jungle biome, so defenses utilizing them cannot be used in these biomes.

For more information on utilizing snow golems for defense, see Tutorials/Snow golems.

** Cat **
The easiest way to use cats is to build a fence around them or just let it simply wander around a closed off area. This way, once a creeper comes, the cat will scare the creeper away.

** Tamed Wolf **
Tamed wolves will kill all hostile things except creepers. If they are in sit mode will not attack if chasing a skeleton. The skeleton will not fight back it will only run away. If you are too far away from your wolf it will teleport to you so keep it on a lead attached to a fence.
