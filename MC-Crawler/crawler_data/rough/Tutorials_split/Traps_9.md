### Arrow trap































A simple arrow dispenser
By connecting this to a trigger, you can rapidly fire arrows at the target. It is recommended to place this trap in a 1-wide 2 tall tunnel so there is less room to run. You can either place this in the side of the tunnel or shooting down the tunnel.
Some variations:

- Placelavain front of thedispenserto catch the target on fire.
- You can adjust therepeater, which will change the speed. You can also completely change theclockif you don't havequartz.
- You could use this to knock the target into apit.
- Attach this to aRS-Latchto keep it on until a button is pressed.
- Usetipped arrowswith negative effects to make the trap more dangerous.

### 
1. Dig a 2-wide trench down 1 block deep on one side, 3 or more on the other.
2. Placesignson the deeper side at the same height as the shallow side.

Wandering mobs will not be afraid to try and walk on the signs. If they do, they will get trapped. This will not always work, so it is advised to make the deeper part wider.

### Spider trap
1. Find acave spidermonster spawner, or enable cheats and use/giveto give yourself one. It is recommended to place atorchto keep it from spawning.
2. Dig a pit under it. It should be at least 5 blocks deep.
3. Placecobwebor something for the spiders to spawn on.
4. Break the torch and allow the pit to fill with spiders. You need to be within 15 blocks for this to work.
5. Get a player to go into the pit.

### Wither rose field
Surround your base with a field of wither roses or sweet berry bushes, and leave a block-wide path leading to your base, or make a hidden underground tunnel leading to it. Any hostile mob that walks through the field takes significant damage, but unless you make the field large enough, this trap isn't fatal. This trap works only on mobs and not on players, because players can disarm it quickly with just a water bucket. For added effect, place cobwebs on top of the plants, and if you are using wither roses, plant them on soul sand. This way, the mobs have to spend more time inside the trap, making it more fatal.

### Fake base 1
1. Build a really high staircase up into the sky. The longer you build, the higher it is, the better.
2. Make a hole into the staircase
3. You can even make yourself look like a noob, which will also give you an advantage. When someone notices and walks up, due to the player's view, they will fall through the hole you create, resulting in the target falling to the ground. This trap can even be effective with experienced players, if they don't look carefully.

### Fake base 2
1. Build a water elevator ( using soul sand and water )
2. At the top of the elevator, start building a fake base. Do not use any valuable material because unlike last trap, it will be destroyed completely (unless you want to).
3. In the fake base, connect twotripwire hookstogether with string right in the top of the elevator. Using redstone dust to lead around the base from the tripwire, then filling it with TNT.
4. If someone notice a base with a water elevator, they will sometimes attempt trying to go up. After they discovered the TNT behind those walls, they are likely to be gone.

### Big spiky fish
1. Make a somewhat small, square-ish room with a one way door and 2 block thick walls
2. Make 1×1×1 holes in the walls
3. Add trapdoors on each hole. Make sure that when closed they're on the upper half of a block, not on the bottom
4. Connect the one way door to a redstone signal inverter that is triggered when walked through
5. Then connect the signal inverter to the trapdoors, just make sure it allows for enough room for step 6*
6. Fill each hole with a pufferfish.
7. Make it look attractive to go into!
8. It's done!

When in action, the player will be trapped and the pufferfish will inflate and bounce around the room. (Fun fact: Fish out of water bounce. A lot.)

*You could probably use some hoppers attached to dispensers and fill the hoppers with buckets of pufferfish. Then, invert power to the dispenser. This makes it a renewable trap!

### It came from the sky
1. Make an observer clock (Face 2 observers at each other, which will produce a blinking redstone signal)
2. Place a redstone comparator going out of the observer clock and use it to change it to subtract mode (the redstone torch on the end is ON) (this is for your on/off switch!)
3. Add a trigger somewhere that goes into a signal inverter and into the SIDE of the comparator, make sure the signal that the comparator receives is equal to the observer's signal (signal strength of 15, like a redstone torch)
4. Now back to the trap, send the comparator's output into a repeater and then a dispenser
5. Now Cover it With Slabs. If you've done it right, your trap should be nearly flush with the ground (1.5 blocks tall from the ground) and only show the dispenser
6. Now fill up the dispenser with arrows. Eggs, snowballs, bottles of enchanting, and potions fly straight up. Arrows and fire charges are offset from the center, but fire charges don't come back down. If you want to destroy something flammable in the sky, FIRE CHARGES
	- (optional) Add a storage block with a hopper going into the dispenser. If the dispenser is empty and getting refilled while the trap is active, it won't shoot as much (Constant fire while containing arrows, shoots twice and "misses" once (It's empty, so it makes the annoying TICK sound) while being refilled)
7. Now maybe disguise it?
8. If you've done this right, it'll start raining arrows when someone activates the trigger. I recommend a flip flop before it activates, and a one time trigger, that way it starts constantly shooting arrows after being triggered.
9. As a last minute extra bit, if you can squeeze one in and a skeleton monster spawner's nearby, why not make the monster spawner an automatic farm and use an item elevator to bring arrows up to it? Just visit every now and then to refill it because of 1.16 mob despawning.
