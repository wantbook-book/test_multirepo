### Water Bucket
- Style: Defensive, hindering
- Range: 7 from source
- Damage: None (Except for endermen, blazes, snow golems and striders)

A water bucket can be used to reduce the speed of approaching mobs, leaving them highly vulnerable to arrow fire and sword damage. Combining this with height, a player can hold off hordes of mobs with little effort. A water bucket provides advantages over the lava bucket in the fact that it is safe to use, is easily removable, and also doubles as a fire extinguisher should the player be set alight. However, it cannot be used in the Nether. Also, by using traps it is possible to drown an opponent. For drowning players it is best to encase the trap in obsidian. It also helps that blocks are harder to break underwater.

A water bucket also has the added benefit of being guaranteed protection from endermen, provided the player is standing in the water.

### Lava Bucket
- Style: Contact, flame, lasting
- Range: 3 from source (7 from source in the Nether)
- Damage: Contact (Except for witches and all Nether mobs apart from piglins and hoglins)

A lava bucket is capable of causing an immense amount of damage to multiple mobs in addition to providing light and greatly hindering mob movement, even more so than water. Any mobs (without fire resistance) that come into contact with lava will suffer 2 whole hearts of constant burn damage every half-second for a total of 4 hearts of damage per second. In addition to that, they will also be set on fire, suffering additional burn damage over time even after leaving the lava. The lava bucket is especially dangerous in confined spaces where it can be used to block off a pathway, preventing most mobs from reaching the user. One should be very careful, however, about where they place lava as that extreme damage figure mentioned above also applies to players.

Lava buckets are almost completely worthless against all nether mobs — their only use is to slow down land-based mobs such as the zombified piglin or the magma cube in the same way that a water bucket is used. Also, the player should note that lava destroys any drops that the mobs would otherwise give, so lava should only be used for an outright kill.

Furthermore, with the bow enchantment update which gives flaming arrows the ability to do burn damage, the lava bucket can be used to place a block of lava and fire arrows through it. The best method is to create a two-block high stack of cheap blocks (dirt or cobblestone is recommended, do not use flammable blocks), which player place the block of lava upon at the top, thereafter the player remove the two blocks under the lava source block creating a lava wall/pile of sorts. The player can now shoot arrows through the wall against enemies which will set them alight. This method is slow, and suited for long-range combat, but is useful for players who do not have access to an enchantment table. This method is also able to ignite enemy TNT at a distance when not equipped with a flame bow.

#### Pros
- Deals extremely high damage, leading to very fast kill.
- Infinite uses, no durability.
- Large area of effect, depending on terrain.
- Slows down the mobs.
- Also acts as lighting.
- Can be used as a trap.
- Can help players keep a distance from hostile mobs.
- Doesn't count as player kill, so safe to use againstpiglins.
- Use in accordance with a bow or power bow for a devastating long-range attack.
- can be mixed with water for obsidian/cobble depending on how you place it.

#### Cons
- Just as dangerous to the player, usually deadly if water is not near. To avoid this downside drink apotionof Fire Resistance.
- Will cause anything flammable nearby to catch fire.
- Takes long time to flow (unless in the Nether).
- Destroys all items that come into contact with it.
- Can take a long time to disappear, potentially blocking the escape route.
- Does not yieldexperience.
- Since Nether mobs are fire-resistant, lava will not harm them, this also apply to boss mobs andvexesas well.

### TNT
- Style: Offensive,explosive
- Range: ~5 block radius
- Damage: Up to 15 hearts to all entities in range

As an explosive, TNT is an incredibly powerful weapon, dealing enough damage to instantly kill most mobs caught in the blast radius and creating a sizable crater, making the area difficult to navigate for future mobs. Because TNT has a rather lengthy fuse and can be activated with redstone, either directly or through a dispensed fire charge, it is most effective as a trap, allowing players to dispatch an enemy indirectly. But because TNT does just as much damage to the player, it is rather dangerous to use in direct combat unless they can get away from the primed TNT faster than their foes can. In addition, TNT is expensive to make, so using an alternative explosive method in this situation, such as a creeper or a bed while in the Nether or the End, is preferred.

### 
- Style: Offensive,explosive
- Range: ~6 block radius
- Damage: Up to ? hearts to all entities in range

Put enemies to bed and lay them to rest. If the player happen to be fighting in the Nether or the End and are about to die, one of the most cruel and ironic ways to kill the enemies is to take them down with the player as they die by using a bed. Simply equip the bed, place it, click on it and it will instantly explode, killing just about anything within a 5 to 7 block radius. In terms of blast force, the bed is actually more powerful than TNT, which makes it that much deadlier and harder to survive. One major downside is that the player have to click on the bed to detonate it which means they will have to be very close to it in order to do it and since the detonation is instant, players are very likely going to kill the player when using a bed as a weapon in the Nether. As a result, aside from taking on the role of a crazy suicide bomber or tricking the opponents into accidentally detonating the bed for the player, they're better off using the bed as a last-ditch final attack to take an opponent with the player into death. However, if you place a block between you and the bed, then click on it, the bed will do little damage to you. 

The bed can also deal a significant amount of damage to the ender dragon, especially if it explodes close to the dragon's head.
