### Camouflage House
Materials

- A stack or two of dirt
- Wooden planks or stone for the inside wall (optional)

Description

A house made out of dirt that blends in with the environment. There are two main versions of this, a house of leaves in a jungle atop a tree, or a base on top of a hill that looks just like the rest of the landscape.

Location

A forest, plains, or jungle biome.

Construction

Use the dirt to blend in with the environment. Make sure to adjust to elevations. The grass will grow on your roof, so it looks even cooler. For maximum security, conceal your door behind a 1×1×2 stack of dirt and don't add any windows. If you're really ambitious, make a piston door with dirt and sticky pistons. Hide the lever behind a block of dirt. This is perfect in multiplayer as it hides your shelter from griefers and thieves.

- Underground shelter underneath the dirt.
- Tunnel to other camo shelters!
- Piston door made out of dirt and sticky pistons.
- Hidden chest full of valuables.
- Flowers, tallgrass and trees for a hint of realism.

### House
The expansion to the Open-Air, in detail.

Materials

- See Open-Air, in the Nomadic section, for walls, but made of something preferably stronger like cobblestone. For the roof, any non-entity (if made out of glass, will be better than windows for lighting).
- Torches
- Sand (for windows)

Description

You've played the game with the walls, now, play it with the roof! A basic house.

Location

Flat, open ground.

Construction

First, build a wall, just like the nomadic open-air. After that, close the roof, add windows (smelt the sand with your furnace), and you're set for expansion! If you like, dig your floor and replace it with any block you like.

Extras

- Mine
- Upper Levels
- Lower Levels
- Traps
- A door
- Corners made out of wood
- Roof made out of stairs
- Chimney
- Carpet

### Cave Home
Materials

- Fair amount of construction-type blocks (cobblestone,wood planks, anddirtall work fine).
- Ample supply oftorches.

Description

A house constructed using a surface cave as its base structure. It can be dangerous due to its initially dark state, but allows for easy expansion. Being a cave, it will contain a mine already within itself.

Location

This type of house can be built in any surface cave one finds. It is a bonus if you find one with coal already in it, as you have your supply of torches supplied by your house. A cave with multiple surface entrances can be used, but may prove more difficult to secure.

Construction

Once you have found a suitable cave, the first step is to seal off the entrances. Use any building material to create a complete seal to keep out night monsters. A wooden door may be added if you have enough wood and time. Otherwise, just seal the entrance off completely (make sure to use torches first, or you may find yourself in the dark) leaving no gaps.

If you proceed deeper into your cave, and monsters are found, it would be wise to seal off the rear end of your cave as well. That is unless you are able to deal with the monsters.

After this, you can hollow out the cave to your liking.

Extras

- Explore the entirety of your house/cave, and extract the riches hiding in your basement.
- Add more rooms by hollowing out more of the cave. All you need is a pickaxe!

### Outpost
Materials

- Fences (for legs)
- Woodorcobblestoneas a building material
- Glassblocks or panes (optional)
- A couple of slabs of the same material as the building material
- Laddersand atrapdoor

Description

A nice house to build. Looks nice when built-in water and lava, if possible. Can also be used as guardhouses/lookout posts. You can also choose to take over a pillager outpost, and make it homely!

Location

In a lake (of water OR lava) or simply on the land (high ground is recommended, using as lookout).

Construction

Once you have found a suitable place to build, start building the fences up from the bottom of the lake on the corners of a 7×7 square, 3 blocks or higher above the ground. Now, start building the actual structure on the 'legs'. This should create a 5×5 interior. Then, Dig a hole in the floor wherever you like and extend a pillar of blocks downward. On those, place ladders and place a trapdoor at the top. Then, do whatever you want with the inside. Don't forget to add some light!

Extras

- Expand to a bigger square
- Add another floor
- Start a farm underneath

Location

In an ocean, river, or deepish lake, preferably not near an ocean monument.

Construction

Go in the water and go about 5 blocks down. Then, mine into the side of the body of water and make a room (you can expand on it later) then, place a door down at the entrance, making an airlock. Then, place a torch down inside. expand on it any way you want to.

Extras

You can use signs in place of the door.
You could use glowstone, sea lanterns, or some other light-emitting block in place of the torches in case your house floods.
