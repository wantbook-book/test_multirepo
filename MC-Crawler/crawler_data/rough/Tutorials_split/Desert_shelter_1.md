### Emergency shelter
Materials[edit | edit source]
- None

### Description
The simplest, yet the fastest possible shelter can be made by digging 3 blocks straight down and then capping off the hole with a block of the player's choosing, like dirt for instance. This requires only a few seconds. While digging straight down like this is never recommended, it is highly unlikely to run into a cave when digging only 3 blocks from the surface. It is relatively safe to expand the shelter from thereon. This type of shelter can be done also when your base is already established, but you are caught by the night while far away from your base. This method is safer than it seems; zombies, skeletons, creepers, endermen and spiders cannot get in. A problem is getting out however; it is a possibility for the player to dig out of the base straight into hostile mobs such as creepers. One way to fix this is to build a little hut above it. This is not permanent; it is advised to seek a more sophisticated shelter after a few nights. Diagram below: To avoid mob spawning when sleeping through the night is impossible due to a lack of wool, one can light up their base using torches.

Description

Since most hostile mobs cannot spawn in liquid, it is possible to use a boat to survive your first night (note that drowned can spawn in water). If you are stuck on a small island out in the middle of an ocean with few (if any) resources around, a boat could be your salvation if you can find enough wood for it and the crafting table required in its creation. For this shelter to work properly, you should stay at least 42 blocks away from the beaches at night to prevent any hostile mobs from spotting you. If you need quick food, craft a fishing rod. Your hunger also does not deplete in a boat.





Operation time:
It should preferably not be used longer than 1-3 Minecraft days (unless you like being nomadic).

Advantages

- Easy to craft, requires only 9 wooden planks.
- Mobile, can easily be moved from one place to another.
- Since you are in the water, you will be always safe from endermen (and other hostile mobs will have a hard time reaching you).
- You can use a bow to snipe hostile mobs from the water with little to no chance of retaliation, then collect their drops at dawn.
- Food can be obtained through fishing.
- If you have to cross an ocean, you could spend the night doing that instead just going to sleep in abed.

Disadvantages

- Works only in oceans.
- Offers evasion, but no protection.
- You will eventually be forced to make your way to the mainland to resupply on resources.
- You cannot use crafting tables, furnaces, chests or anything similar without finding solid ground.
- Fishingis not a reliable source of food in the long run.
- Requires you to disembark from the boat and to proceed on foot if you have to cross the solid ground.
- If askeletondestroys the boat (which is likely to happen if you get too close), you will have to quickly replace it to avoid drowning.

### Cocooning
Description
Like how a caterpillar surrounds itself with a cocoon in order to undergo metamorphosis, this shelter involves simply surrounding yourself with a certain material to shelter yourself from the dark. 

Materials

- At its smallest, just 9-13 blocks of a chosen material
- The recommended build size requires 25 blocks

Structure: (As seen from the ground upwards)

Anywhere

Extras

- Torches
- A door
- Windows (can be made with fences)
- Basic fortifications (like fences and walls etc.)

### Crater Home
Materials

- Creeper (if no basin already exists)
- Alternatively, TNT

Description

Use a creeper-made (or TNT-caused) crater or stone basin as a temporary (or permanent, if you want) home. While easy to make, it is not recommended for a long-term stay unless expanded and upgraded.

Location

Anywhere with a crater/basin.

Construction

Either...

(Example 1)
Jump into the crater, and begin digging a 2 block high hole in the side (you may dig down 1-2 blocks if the crater is not deep enough) for the opening. Then go in and hollow out a small room inside of that. You may like to dig down a few more rooms, but it is not recommended if you have no lighting. Cover the opening with blocks (dirt or cobblestone works wonders.) 

or...

(Example 2)
If the crater/basin is small enough and you have enough blocks to allow it, cover the whole crater/basin with a roof made out of dirt, cobblestone, etc., but leave a small entry hole, jump into the crater/basin and block off the hole, then light up the interior. This gives you a slightly more spacious home, but it requires you to have enough blocks to build a roof to cover the whole crater/basin.

Extras

- Bed
- Torches
- A ladder to get out (example 2 only)

### Tree
Materials

Glass, wood logs, leaves, stairs, wood planks, 

Description

Inside a normal tree. It's a simple shelter and works best for emergencies, since it doesn't have much expansion possibilities in a short time(unless you put down some saplings and connect the trees).

Location

Anywhere with a tree or a sapling and bone meal and enough space.

Construction

Break the tree trunk and then use the wood logs to pillar jump up quickly until you are completely covered by leaves. Then put the 2 remaining blocks on opposite sides to avoid leaf decay and done, you got a practically perfect shelter that blends with the environment! You can get on top of the tree removing the logs and pillar jumping all the way up.

Extras

- More logs to avoid leaf decay.
- A torch.
- A crafting table, a furnace and a chest.
- The tree shelter can be converted into a treehouse.
- If you want more space, use a 2Ã—2 grid of saplings to create a large Tree (does not work with all tree species)
