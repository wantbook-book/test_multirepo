## General tips for each famous kit
### Sword
Basic tips: 

- Learn to sprint-reset and S tap effectively.
- A lower DPI and a lower sensitivity is important to keep your crosshair steady on your opponent.
- Diamond sword isn't simply about getting your enemies in combos. You need to learn how to crit and jump-reset.
- As mentioned before, jump-resetting is incredibly useful in negating knockback.
- Most importantly, spacing and timing is important. Aim and strafing is useless without the aforementioned two.

Advanced tips:

- Sometimes you would meet people who have higher ping than others, making it challenging to defeat them as combos won't work. Try critting them out instead as combos are almost useless against them.
- Switch playstyles depending on the situation. Although it's important to have a main style, having backup styles won't be as bad, and if your opponent can decode your style, you can have plan B to defeat him.
- If on a p-crit trade, you can be unpredictable by immediately W-tapping him, which can mess up his aim. You can also do this when your opponent is trying to crit you out and you critted him once. This latter tip is called "Sprint Hit Deflection".

### Netherite pot
Basic tips:

- Your main fighting style in this kit is p-critting with occasional knockback hits to keep some distance and get extra hits on your opponent.
- Golden apples should be on your offhand, don't put a totem unless you're going to do Deivi popping (explained later) since with a totem on your offhand, you'd have to hotkey to yourgapples, unlike when your gapples are on your offhand, you can just hold right click to eat. This makes it so you don't have to reset your attack timer after eating.
- You can combo opponents but don't make this your main style, as netherite armor has a passive knockback resistance that cancels out knockback, as well as jump resetting. Hit-selecting also doesn't work so don't mainly rely on your sword skills to win in nethpot fights, as critting and timing are much more important.
- Never use a scrollwheel, force yourself to use your keybinds to pot fast.
- Deception: Try to run away for a moment and at the least expected moment, W-tap them afront and combo them. You can also crit them out instead of W-tapping depending on your preference.

Advanced tips:

- Mirroring: When your opponent gaps, you gap right after them. This results in you having more healing than your opponent.
- Strafing: When in a p-crit trade, press S then W-tap to combo an opponent.
- Deivi Popping: A technique created by Deivi_17. When low on effects, offhand a totem, make sure you have at least 2 healing pots, a strength and a swiftness pot. Then do a suicidal move, after your totem pops, immediately splash all your pots to win in an engagement. Not recommended when your opponent has a way higher HP than you (like more than 6 hearts) and when they gap as well.

### Axe and shield
Axe is a very strategical mode. The axe is your main weapon, and players play very dirty. Autohitting and Backstabbing is of great importance. It's very common to let the opponent disable your shield, autohit them, shoot them with a crossbow to push them away, and run until their shield is back. You need a good understanding of what each player has available to them, and therefore what move they want to make. Baiting your opponent into jumping could get you a free crit, turning the tide of the round. Bowing them near the end of the round when they have no shield might finish them off. At any moment you might only have one opportunity or play to make, and your job is to find it and execute it properly.

### Diamond potion
Basic tips:

- Although the standard sword kit provides the foundation of how to fight, your aim would drastically be changed due to the Speed II effect present in the kit. Therefore it's advisable for players to play at Speed kit (sometimes labelled as ninja) to get the hang of the new speed effect.
- Healing and refill speed plays a big role, as well as hotkeying. Modify your keybinds to what suit you the best. Although scrollwheeling may be great for starters, it would be very annoying in the long run and a player who relies on hotkeys rather than the scrollwheel will most of the time heal faster than a scrollwheel player. For refills (putting pots in your hotbar), practice butterfly clicking, shift and accurately pinpointing the pots you want.
- Try to play close to your opponent with crits and jump resets if they are low, so that you can hit them and steal the potion effects when they turn to heal.

### UHC
UHC is unique for a reason, that is because of a game mechanic being absent, the ability to heal naturally. This meant that you can't heal on food alone, and you'd need the regen and absorption from golden apples to heal. Aside from that, UHC has a diverse inventory of melee, ranged weapons and utilities that players can use to their advantage.

Players must be fast at hotkeying, and scrollwheels won't simply cut it, since hotkeys are more accurate and faster. Second, players must know how to use each utility to their advantage, and must know when to fight defensively to drain or offensively to drop your opponent. Blocks for example, can be used not only to build/bridge up but also to put out a lava or a water source block when placed down. Its an interesting mix of the melee combat similar to SMP kit and intense mastery of usage of utility items.

### SMP
Now each SMP might have a set of standard rules when it comes to fighting, such as netherite or certain potions being illegal. Even though this is the case, the tips here can still be used on SMPs regardless of their rules. For this kit, we're going to assume that the kit contains fully enchanted netherite armor, 2 netherite swords (one is fully enchanted without Knockback I, while the other doesn't have Knockback), a fully enchanted netherite axe, 2 stacks of gapples, one totem, around 4 stacks of pearls, a fully enchanted shield, 2 stacks of XP bottles and finally copius amounts of Strength II, Speed II and some Fire Resistance (8 minutes) potions.

Basic tips:

- Master the shield techniques, as well as sword techniques. These will be your biggest tools.
- Shield would be one of your biggest roadblocks in SMP fighting. Try to learn when your opponent is going to shield and disable it with an axe, giving you a huge opening.
- Pearl away at around 4 hearts, also you shouldn't pearl too close for your enemy to chase you, but also not too far that it would take some time to actually teleport you to the pearl.
- Deception: You can try to fake that you're low, eat 1 or 2 gapples to fill your saturation and play aggressively. Your opponent may naturally forget to heal since they thought you're on low HP, pushing you and accidentally dropping.
- Drain: Take as little hits as possible. Always heal away from your opponent so that they don't hurt your armor durability while you are healing.
- Knockback I sword can be a gamechanger. You can use techniques such as crit deflects and combos that are usually ineffective against netherite armor.
