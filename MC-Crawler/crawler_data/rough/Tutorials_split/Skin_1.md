### Bedrock Edition
Since Pocket Edition v0.11.0 alpha, players can choose one of the two default skins either Steve or Alex, and can apply their own custom skin. (Uses the same format as the Java edition). The player must select a valid skin image from their photo library, and must choose between the two main models. Players can also spend Minecraft Coins to buy skin packs. The Legacy Skin Pack was also implemented in Bedrock Edition, but the player has to sign in to Xbox Live to access all the skins. It also includes five anonymous skins. Players can also make their own skin packs, which must include a manifest.json file, a skins.json file, and all the desired skins. An additional .lang file can be added inside a folder labeled texts to display the skin names, but the game can register the skins without it.

The character creator is a feature in Bedrock Edition (and was in Minecraft Earth until discontinuation) that lets players customize their skins with free and paid-for cosmetic items. It can be accessed by selecting the character profile button on the main menu. It can also be used to equip capes. Many clothing items cost Minecoins (Tokens on PlayStation 4), or can be earned by completing certain achievements.

## Templates

Many players prefer their own unique skin. While many premade skins can be found online, many players prefer to create their own.

A custom skin is a way to personalize the player model and can be done either by using a variety of community-made skin editors, or by editing the steve.png or alex.png file manually with an image editor like Photoshop, GIMP, Paint.net or similar image editors. The steve.png file can be downloaded here and the alex.png file here. When editing the steve.png or alex.png file manually, be sure to keep the original image dimensions and make the background of the skin (the unused pixels) completely transparent. Otherwise, Minecraft may fail to recognize the skin as intended.

Alternatively, some may find it easier to use a program, either downloadable or in-browser, which provides a live view of their character on a three-dimensional model as they are editing the skin.  For example, programs may further assist players by providing them with a wide variety of pre-made selections (such as hats, boots, sweaters, etc.), to give the skin creator exactly what they want, even if the creator has little to no artistic skill.

After making a custom skin, either by using a skin editor or by editing the steve.png file directly, one still needs to upload the .png file at the Skin section of the Profile page on Minecraft.net (found here) before the skin is applied. Other players in multiplayer can also see this skin. Note that players cannot see the custom skin if they are not logged in or when playing offline.

## Number of Skins
The total number of possible unique player skins varies immensely, depending on what is considered "unique". In the table below, there are four different definitions with a cell of its corresponding number of skins, along with an approximation. Usually, skins can only have transparent pixels on the outer layer, while in singleplayer Minecraft Java Edition, skins can also have transparent pixels on the inner layer. The bottom row of the table below includes skins with inner layers with transparent pixels, and the row above doesn't. Another factor is how there are 224 fully transparent colors, which could either be considered unique or identical. The right column of the table considers each transparent color to be unique, while the column to its left considers all fully transparent colors to be identical.

In the "All 0-Alpha Pixels Unique" column, the definitions are relatively simple, 291392 + 287808 and 2104448 + 2100352, with an integer power of two for the number of 4 px skins added to an integer power of two for the number of 3 px skins. The "All 0-Alpha Pixels Same" column has far more complicated definitions. This is because just to calculate the number of unique colors including alpha, it has to take the 224 unique RGB colors, multiply that by the 255 non-fully-transparent colors, then add the single fully transparent color.

In an AntVenom video, he calculated a total of 281600 × 53264 (≈3.060 133 2201 × 1026845) skins. The rules he used were to only include 4 px skins, only allow transparent pixels on the top layer, consider all fully transparent pixels to be unique, and include only 100 possible alpha values.
