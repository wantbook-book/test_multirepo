## Zombie Doctor
Weaken and then cure a Zombie Villager

Requirements: Turn a zombie villager into a villager.

You will need to find a zombie villager, put it under the Weakness effect and give it a golden apple (by facing the zombie and pressing the use key with a golden apple in your hand). This process is called curing. There are a few methods to do this.

The easiest one is to find an igloo with a basement. This place is designed specifically for the Zombie Doctor advancement. Igloo basements generate with all the key ingredients: a zombie villager in a cage, a splash potion of Weakness inside of the brewing stand, and a golden apple inside of the chest. Simply break one of the iron bars holding the zombie villager, splash it with the potion, and give it the golden apple. After a maximum of five minutes, zombie villager will be cured and you will be granted the advancement.

Alternatively, if you can't find any igloos with basements, you can get a brewing stand and brew the potion of Weakness yourself. You can either craft the stand or find it.

| Ingredients                        | Crafting recipe |
|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Blaze Rod+<br/>Anystone-tier block |                 |

To obtain a blaze rod, you need to kill a blaze (more info about that under the Into Fire advancement). Blaze rods are not only used to craft the brewing stand, but also as a fuel for it (just craft the blaze rod into blaze powder), so even if you find a stand, you still need blaze rods to fuel it up.

Besides igloos, brewing stands also generate as a block in villages (church) and end ships.

Next, to brew a splash potion of Weakness, you will need a fermented spider eye:

| Ingredients                               | Crafting recipe |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Brown Mushroom+<br/>Sugar+<br/>Spider Eye |                 |

Spider eye drops from killing spiders, cave spiders, and witches. It can also generate in desert temples. 

Sugar can be crafted from sugar cane or a honey bottle. It can also drop from witches. 

Brown mushrooms generate in caves of Overworld, on the surface in swamp, old growth taiga and mushroom fields biomes, and almost everywhere in the Nether. They also generate in woodland mansions. Brown mushrooms can also drop from brown mushroom blocks, which are a part of huge mushrooms.

Next, you need a water bottle. Use a glass bottle in the main hand or in the off hand on a water source block.

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Glass       | 3               |

Water bottles can be also obtained through fishing or bartering.

The following steps are performed in the brewing stand. For more information about brewing, see the pages "Potion" and "Brewing".

First, brew a normal potion of Weakness:

| Potion                             | Potion brewing recipe |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| <br/>Potion of Weakness<br/>(1:30) |                       |

To turn a potion of Weakness into a splash potion of Weakness, you need a piece of gunpowder, which drops from killing creepers, ghasts, or witches. Gunpowder also generates in dungeons, desert temples, shipwrecks and woodland mansions.

| Potion                                    | Potion brewing recipe |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| <br/>Splash potion of Weakness<br/>(1:30) |                       |

Witches also can throw splash potions of Weakness, if for some reason you can't go to the Nether. You can also shoot the zombie villager with an arrow of Weakness, but that's not recommended for multiple reasons: such arrows are hard to obtain, will hurt (and potentially kill) the zombie, and their effect lasts much shorter (1/8 of the time) than from the potion.

Next, get a golden apple. It can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients           | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Gold Ingot+<br/>Apple |                 |

Apples drop from oak leaves and dark oak leaves. Apples also generate in village plains houses and blacksmiths, bonus chests and strongholds. They can also be bought from apprentice-level farmer villagers.

Gold ingots can be obtained by smelting raw gold, gold ore or nether gold ore:

| Ingredients                                                                         | Smelting recipe |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Raw Goldor<br/>Gold Oreor<br/>Deepslate Gold Oreor<br/>Nether Gold Ore+<br/>Anyfuel |                 |

or by crafting them like so:

| Name       | Ingredients   | Crafting recipe |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Gold Ingot | Gold Nugget   |                 |
| Gold Ingot | Block of Gold | 9               |

Gold ingots also generate in village blacksmiths, toolsmith's and temple houses; dungeon,s mineshafts, buried treasures, bastions, desert temples, end cities, jungle pyramids, nether fortresss, ruined portals, shipwrecks, strongholds and woodland mansions.

Golden apples also generate in dungeons, mineshafts, bastions, desert temples, ancient cities, ruined portals, strongholds, ocean ruins and woodland mansions.

Zombie villagers spawn rarely as a variant of normal zombies. They also have a chance to spawn after a zombie kills a villager; it depends on difficulty of the game. To make sure that the zombie villager doesn't burn from sunlight, doesn't despawn and is not killed by an iron golem, it is recommended to trap the zombie villager and stay nearby during the process of curing.

After successfully trapping the zombie villager, splash it with potion of Weakness / shoot it with arrow of Weakness / make the witch splash it with its potion, and then give the zombie a golden apple. You will be granted the advancement once villager is cured, which takes up to 5 minutes.
