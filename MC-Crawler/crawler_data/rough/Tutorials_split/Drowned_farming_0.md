# Tutorials/Drowned farming
Drowned farming is a way to harvest experience orbs and loot dropped by both zombie and drowned mobs. In addition to explaining general mechanics of drowned farming, this tutorial describes two basic drowned farms that are easy to construct in survival mode, without needing a villager as bait.

In all editions, the simple flooded-dungeon farm described first produces rotten flesh, iron, gold and chainmail armor, and weapons dropped by zombies, as well as experience orbs and copper ingots dropped by drowned, but not nautilus shells or tridents. In Bedrock Edition this farm also produces nautilus shells, but not tridents.

The aerial farm (described second) produces only drowned drops including tridents, but not zombie drops. While the aerial farm doesn't require exotic materials, it does require large amounts of materials and is more time-consuming to build.

More complex farms are possible, particularly underwater farms for naturally-spawned drowned, which also yield tridents and nautilus shells. The simple flooded-dungeon farm described here is still useful for gaining a quick and easy way to harvest experience and zombie drops without requiring significant construction or materials.

## Mechanics
There are three main ways to farm drowned, depending on the Edition and which drops you desire most. In most cases, it's a good idea to kill the drowned manually to obtain the more valuable loot.

### Flooded dungeon
The detailed instructions in this tutorial explain how to use a flooded dungeon that converts zombies to drowned. This is the easiest method to implement.

In Java Edition, this farm produces the usual zombie drops as well as experience (XP), but it doesn't produce the tridents and nautilus shells specific to drowned. In Bedrock Edition, this farm does produce nautilus shells but not tridents (zombies converted to drowned no longer drop tridents as of Bedrock Edition 1.16.0).

A flooded dungeon works by spawning zombies from the monster spawner in the dungeon. The zombies are funneled into an underwater chamber where they drown. Once converted to drowned, the player can manually kill them for their loot and experience.

The advantage to the flooded dungeon farm is that it produces potentially valuable zombie drops, such as iron swords and shovels, chainmail armor, and gold armor â€” any of which may have valuable enchantments. The disadvantage is that it does not produce tridents in any edition, and does not produce nautilus shells in Java Edition. However, it does produce copper ingots in both editions, as well as nautilus shells in Bedrock Edition.

### Aerial
An aerial farm is probably the most practical way to farm tridents. It works by spawning drowned naturally on an aerial platform at least 24 blocks above the player, with the player being beyond the maximum spawning range of any other spawnable surface in the world. The drowned spawn naturally under the correct conditions of being underwater at light level zero, and they are funneled first into an intermediate area to prevent lethal fall damage, before dropping into the killing chamber where the player waits. The farm described here takes advantage of a mechanic in Bedrock Edition whereby a single layer of water causes an increasing reduction of light level with depth below that layer; the drowned spawn on a wet platform some distance under a glass-bottomed pool of water. In Java Edition, two layers of water may be needed for the platform to spawn drowned.

The disadvantage to the aerial farm is that it produces only drowned drops, but not zombie drops. As such, it is a good source of nautilus shells, tridents, and copper ingots, but not the valuable zombie drops such as enchanted items and armor made from iron or gold.

### Underwater
An underwater farm is another way to farm tridents. Drowned farms in a body of water are more complicated because they function similar to a dry-land mob farm.

In an underwater farm, naturally-spawned drowned are attracted to a location and funneled into one area where the player can kill them. A villager is typically used as bait to attract drowned, and the funneling can be accomplished with bubble columns. Transporting a villager to an undersea room in survival mode is a complex undertaking that requires much forethought, preparation, implementation time, and risk.

Instead of a villager, a turtle egg might also work as bait, although this is less reliable because drowned don't detect eggs as they do villagers; they must first happen to look in the egg's direction, then have a clear path to the egg, and the egg must have sufficient space above to allow trampling on it.

Like an aerial farm, an underwater farm does not produce zombie drops, only drowned drops.

## Flooded dungeon
### Location
The simplest way to start a drowned and zombie farm is to locate a dungeon room that contains a zombie mob spawner. Ideally the room should be reasonably close to the overworld surface, but can be any depth that allows for digging 5 blocks or so underneath the floor. Sometimes a dungeon is found a short distance inside a cave entrance. Unlike an XP farm that generally requires a long falling distance from the dungeon to bring the mobs to near death, no deep excavation is required for a drowned farm.

### Preparation
To construct a drowned farm, you need a conveniently located dungeon with a zombie monster spawner, as well as a good weapon to clear out the dungeon, a cheap weapon to harvest drowned, torches, pickaxes, a water bucket, and a few signs. Optionally, glass blocks are helpful for viewing when a zombie becomes drowned. Hoppers and a couple of chests also aid collection but are not necessary.

For convenience, it is nice to have nearby (outside the dungeon room), a source of water to scoop with the bucket, gates or doors to keep mobs from wandering into your cave while you work, and a home base or temporary base with your bed, crafting table, and other helpful items a short walk away.
