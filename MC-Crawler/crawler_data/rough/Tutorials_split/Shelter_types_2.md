### Cliff-side Cave
Materials

- A pickaxe
- (Optional) A shovel.
- (Optional) A sword, just in case you happen to run into an unexpected cave with mobs in it.


Description

A cliff-side cave is probably the most popular shelter for the first night. It takes only a few seconds to make, and once inside, the creator is safe to expand it. It also offers good protection against most mobs (excluding creepers, as they can blow up your rock walls). Since it's a structure inside the ground, building material will be gained instead of lost when expanding it.

Location

The most common location for this shelter is wherever you mined your first cobblestone or coal, simply expand the hole you made to make it livable and, WHAM! you got yourself a cliff-side shelter.
The best part of this shelter is that you can build it anywhere there's a cliff. Make sure there's a solid wall (preferably straight up). Mining down does not usually make a good shelter. A cliff by a large body of water is preferred as hostile mobs cannot spawn in the water. Also, try to find a place with coal for torches.

Construction
Extremely simple. Mine a 1×1×2 hole in the wall, then enter the hole and close it off. From there, you may start mining deeper.

Extras

- Torches
- Mine extension
- Link to an above-ground base
- Plenty of rations and tools in case you drop into another tunnel and find yourself trapped.

### Village housing
Materials:

- At least around 6 torches
- A bed

Description:

Claim a village house for yourself and convert it into a home.

Location:

A village

Construction:

The first part is the hardest: first, find a village. 
Once you find a village, pick a house that you find suitable and claim it as your home, customize and upgrade at your leisure. 

If you're just trying to spend the night in the village, the plains temple, taiga temple, or one of desert small house (tower house) is usually the best choice, because the door keeps you safe (except that zombies may spawn inside during sieges, or break down the door in hard mode) and because the building has a tower, you can be safe from a surprise creeper attack in the morning. Just before exiting the building, double-check that there is no creeper nearby from the top of the tower. Then go outside and do your things.

One major downside is that if the player is within the village during night, this is likely going to attract the attention of zombies which can easily lead to the whole villager population being wiped out over time, due to several different factors. Also, if a player has the Bad Omen effect, then a raid can occur in the village and most likely will kill the villagers with the village, due some illagers being able to break or even open doors. 

If you want to protect the villagers, but do not have enough materials to build a wall around the village and light up the whole area, simply do the following:

- Collect as many materials as you can: You need torches and dirt.
- Thoroughly light up the interior of all houses that have doors on them to prevent hostile mob spawning
- Wait until all the villagers have gone indoors, then barricade the doors with a 1-2 block tall stack of dirt in front of the door.
	- The villagers will not be able to come out (and get into trouble) and zombies will not be able to get in (and kill the villagers)
		- This is for the villagers' own safety, their AI is woefully ill-equipped to deal with the dangers of the outside world.

Extras:

- Build a second floor (which some of the houses already come with)
- Add furniture (which some of the buildings come with)
- Occupy the whole village! The buildings that have a chance of being generated in the village include the library, which includes bookshelves (which you can later mine using theSilk Touchenchantment), other buildings which also have bookshelves; one of snowy tundra medium house (house made of wood) and one of taiga medium house (medium house without furnace). Some small houses also have a crafting table. There's also the weaponsmith shop, which comes with furnaces; 2 furnaces for plains, desert and one of savanna weaponsmith (weaponsmith with smooth stone), but there is no furnace in taiga and snowy taiga weaponsmith, however, one of taiga medium house has a single furnace, also, furnaces can be found in many houses if you are in snowy tundra village. A small pool of lava can be found in plains, desert, snowy taiga, and savanna village weaponsmith (taiga and snowy taiga village has no lava), and many buildings have a chest of goodies. The plains temple (which looks like a classic church) is a two-story building, and you can use the tower and roof to look over the entire village, alternatively one of desert village small house, which looks like a tower can also be used if you are in desert village, due it being the tallest building in village, consist of staircase with 4 windows hole (1 window hole each floor).
- Light up and build a wall around the village to ensure that you (and the inhabitants) will be safe while going from house to house.
- No need to put a crafting table or furnace in your house! If there is a building with a crafting table and a building with a furnace, the aforementioned blocks can be retrieved from there, just build a house with a bed (beds in villages are claimed by villagers, so you need to make one for yourself) and a chest (some buildings have chests orbarrels, which can be used as storage). Some buildings also havesmokers,blast furnaces, orcampfires(within taiga and snowy taiga villages). When you get an enchantment table, place more bookshelves in the library, then place the enchantment table.
