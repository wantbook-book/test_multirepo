## Settings
It's important to determine the best settings for you. Settings don't improve your fighting skill rather they make your fights more comfortable. Its discouraged to constantly change your settings to try to find the "perfect" setting that will magically make you the best. Get settings that don't limit your gameplay and get skilled with them.

Having more FPS is incredibly important if you have a low-end system. Tone down most of your graphics, such as setting it to "Fast", turning down your render distance, and turning your FPS cap to unlimited are some examples that can somewhat improve your FPS.

Next are your controls. First, modifying your keybinds is totally up to you. Using the default 1-9 isn't recommended, as the numbers past 4 or 5 are inconvenient to reach. Some good keybinds are 1-4, z, x, c, r, f, q, capslock, and mouse buttons if possible. Although using the scroll wheel in your mouse can be helpful, keybinds are faster and more accurate than using the scroll wheel if you become good with your keybinds. Your mouse sensitivity is also dependent on each player and choosing one that you're comfortable with is essential with getting better aim. With a high sensitivity, your crosshair would start becoming shaky and you won't accurately track your opponent as your mouse is too fast, while if your sensitivitiy is too low, your rotation is too slow, thus you won't be able to track your opponent that moves too much and too fast. Other settings to change are turning Auto-jump to off and turning your sprint to "Toggle".

An ideal FOV is any FOV above 80-85, letting you see enough so that enemies can't strafe behind you easily but not making opponents too small if they are at the edge of your reach. Its best to turn off FOV effects as well as Damage Tilt completely, as they cause your screen to warp and shake during fights and make aim much harder.

Texture packs or resource packs (whatever you call them) are optional but sometimes they make your PVP experience more comfortable. Beware of claims that PVP texture packs that some youtubers say will make you better are false, they don't make you better, they just make your experience better. Some vanilla textures in the game obstruct your vision too much, such as food, explosion particles, swords, fire, and offhand items, so texture packs reducing the size of those are definitely recommended.

Utility mods are useful in combat, as well as performance-enhancing mods. InventoryHUD tells you your armor durability, potion timers and what your inventory has, along with other useful information including how many arrows do you have. Health indicators are not always allowed on every server so it's best to check before installing one. Sodium and OptiFine are the two best FPS enhancing mods, although OptiFine isn't compatible with Fabric mods unless you download OptiFabric, which allows you to use OptiFine and other fabric mods simultaneously (do note to that OptiFine and Sodium aren't compatible even with OptiFabric). Appleskin is a mod which tells you your saturation which is important in healing (more about that later) and is available with both Forge and Fabric versions. Custom Crosshair Mod customizes your crosshair, and it would change the color of your crosshair once a mob is within your reach, allowing you to time your hits better. There are more mods out there to improve your experience in PvP, but these are some of the more popular ones.

## Locations of PvP
In PvP, the fighters will have to fight in some setting, whether it be a custom-designed arena, normal terrain, or in a challenge map.

### Normal terrain
This is when two players fight in the naturally generated terrain of Minecraft. In this type of fight, players decide on a designated area or may be unexpectedly attacked (underground, caves, cliffs, or strongholds). One can also add custom features into the natural terrain, normally player-built structures.

### Custom-built terrain
This is PvP that takes place in a unique area or challenge map. Players that are friends may decide to create or use a challenge map that facilitates PvP. The players may choose to divide themselves into multiple groups, enjoy a free-for-all, or any other distribution of players that fight among one another.

Players may prefer to build an arena for the sake of organization or aesthetics.

#### Types of arena
- Spawn: Many servers have a PvP area at spawn or even around it! Be warned though, because you usually can't place or break blocks.
- Vanilla: PVP out in the wilderness of naturally generated terrain!
- Ancient: Build a Colosseum inspired by the ancient Romans with fights against animals and perhaps some blood (redstone) on the floor â€” use stone or different kinds of stone brick for walls, grass or sand as the floor, andwoodfor decoration and breaking the stone  up.
- Survival games: A huge arena that's in a dome and often has multiple biomes incorporated into it. The walls must be obsidian, bedrock or barrier. Supporters and spectators can send in messengers with food, armor etc. The battle goes on until there is a last player standing!
- Multi-leveled: Have several floors on the arena with random holes; make sure the sides are made ofglassso spectators can see all the gravitational action.
- Spleef Twist: Who says you have to do the dirty work? Let lava below the map do it for you (tell combatants before the match to avoid having to pay compensation)! Run around stabbing your opponent while removing the floor from beneath their feet.
- Bridge: Players attempt to cross a narrow bridge, killing enemies and/or scoring points at the other side. Players can hit their opponents using eggs, snowballs, bows, snow golems, etc. until they fall through the void or the lava, To defend yourself from falling use shields, pearls and some blocks.
- Bedrock formations:This area is just made out of bedrock formations, it makes PvP a lot more interesting and makes movements more challenging. It is usually used for Crystal PvP.
