### Bee our guest

Goal: Use a Campfire to collect Honey from a Beehive using a Bottle without aggravating the bees.

First, you need to have a bee nest or beehive you want to collect a honey bottle from. It only gives you the achievement if you collect a honey bottle and not honeycomb. Next you need to place a campfire under the beehive. Note that if you try to harvest any kind of honey from a beehive without placing a campfire underneath it, the bees will get angry. They will come out and sting you, which will hurt you, inflict you with Poison and kill the bees in about a minute. You will not get the achievement. Try to place the campfire a few blocks below the hive, otherwise the bees may injure themselves coming out. Remember that campfires will break and only give you Charcoal if you try to pick them up without Silk Touch. After you have "smoked" the hive like this, use a glass bottle on the hive to collect a honey bottle. You should then get the achievement.

### Total Beelocation

Goal: Move and place a Bee Nest, with 3 bees inside, using Silk Touch.

First, you need to make sure you have a tool enchanted with Silk Touch. Any tool with the enchantment will work. If you try to collect a bee nest without Silk Touch, then it will break, disappear, and any bees inside and close by will get angry and attack you. Then you need to make sure three bees are inside the hive. If there aren't enough, you can breed bees with any kind of flower. Once three bees are inside, mine the nest with your Silk Touch tool. You should then get the achievement and can move the nest wherever you like.

### Sticky Situation

Goal: Slide down a honey block to slow your fall.

This achievement is easiest obtained in 2 ways:

- The first way is to place a honey block a block above the ground, and jump up, and move toward the block.
- The second way is to copy the first one, but place more honey on top and pillar up.

Either way, it may take several tries.

### Hot tourist destination

Goal: Visit all Nether biomes.

Visit these 5 biomes by exploring the nether: basalt deltas, crimson forest, nether wastes, soul sand valley, and warped forest.

### Caves and Cliffs

Goal: Free fall from build height limit (Y=320) to bottom of the world (min. Y=-62) and survive.

The easiest way to go down to minimum Y=-62 is go down to the deepest spot of a ravine or cave . Then, mine blocks until you reach the Y -62 coordinate.

To go up at Y=320, climb up on a tall mountain and place missing blocks to the build height limit or simple place blocks to a build height limit without climbing on anything.

To survive the fall, the easiest way is by placing water at the bottom of the world (Y=-62).
