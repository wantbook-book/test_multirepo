#### Scaffolding Interaction
Scaffolding's collision box changes depending on where you view it from. From above, scaffolding acts like a top slab, while from below it acts like an empty block. From the same level, unsupported scaffolding acts like a bottom slab, however supported scaffolding appears empty.

When shulkers attempt to teleport, they use their current location to determining the scaffolding collision box test the validity of a particular spot. This means that there are certain setups that the shulkers can only teleport to from certain locations. Furthermore, since the relative position of the shulker changes after teleporting, the new location can suddenly appear invalid, and the shulker will immediately attempt to teleport away.

In particular, placing a solid block (or any block with a solid bottom surface) one block above scaffolding creates a location which shulkers can only teleport to from below, but which appears as an invalid spot after the shulker has teleported to it. This can be used to transport shulkers upwards, and is especially useful for removing shulkers from the region around the breeding shulker, making a number of farm designs possible.

## Moving Shulkers to the Overworld
The Core Mechanism is Make Shulkers teleport to End Portal.

### Making shulkers ride Minecarts
If a minecart is next to a shulker, then the shulker will ride the minecart.













Simple design. Detector rail means minecart is placed here. 
Shulker Box is Position of Shulker.




So, you can move Shulkers near the end portal, but because the shulker is riding a minecart, it won't teleport to the Overworld. So, use an activator rail.

### Making shulkers teleport to End Portal
If you cover all the blocks a shulker can teleport to except the block you want it to teleport to with a Button, it is possible to make shulkers teleport to specified position.

#### Notes
- Buttons must be placed on the bedrock part of exit portal.

- Shulkers must be pushed by a piston to into the End Portal.
