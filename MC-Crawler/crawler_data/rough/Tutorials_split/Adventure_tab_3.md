## Hero of the Village
Successfully defend a village from a raid

See also: Tutorials/Defeating a village raid

Requirements: Kill a raid captain, enter a village and complete a raid.

First, kill a raid captain (which will award the Voluntary Exile advancement) and get the Bad Omen effect. Then, go to a village: it can be either a naturally-generated village, or a structure that you made yourself. Even a single villager with either a claimed bed or a job site block counts. 

Once you entered the village, a bossbar labeled "Raid" will appear and your Bad Omen effect will disappear, indicating that a raid has started. There will be numerous amounts of waves of the raid based on the difficulty. If you kill a single captain, there are 3 waves in Easy, 5 in Normal, and 7 in Hard: killing more captains results in one extra wave appearing.

Mobs that will spawn during the raid are: pillagers, vindicators, and ravagers, which spawn on all difficulties; evokers, vexes and witches, which only spawn on Normal and Hard difficulties. Ridden ravagers spawn with a pillager on Normal and with pillagers, vindicators and evokers on Hard. Illusioners are unused.

Once you have completed the raid (every illager is dead and you directly killed at least one of them), you will get the "Hero of the Village" advancement. You will also get the status effect of the same name, Hero of the Village.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 100 experience.

This is a hidden advancement, meaning that it can only be viewed when the player has completed the advancement.

Look at a ghast through a spyglass

Requirements: Use a spyglass while aiming at a ghast.

The second of spyglass advancements (for the first one, see Is It a Bird?) requires you to look through it at a ghast. This should be easy, as ghasts are common in the Nether and hard to miss because of their size.

| Ingredients                      | Crafting recipe |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Amethyst Shard+<br/>Copper Ingot |                 |

Once you zoom in on the ghast, you will be granted the advancement.

## A Throwaway Joke
Throw a trident at something. Note: Throwing away your only weapon is not a good idea.

Requirements: Throw a trident at any mob.

First, you need a trident. They drop exclusively from drowned. 

Drowned can be found around ocean ruins or underwater in light level 0 in rivers, aquifers in the dripstone caves and all ocean biomes. 6.25% of drowned (on average 1 out of 16) spawn with a trident, and there is a 8.5% chance for the drowned to drop its trident, if it was killed by a player. This chance can be increased with Looting, up to 11.5% with level III. A shield can be helpful fighting drowned underwater, as their tridents deal massive damage.

Once you have obtained the trident, you then have to throw it at any mob (a melee attack with the trident will not work). Hold use for about 2 seconds and release it, aiming at your target mob. Once the thrown trident has hit a mob, you will be rewarded the advancement.

Note that the trident's durability will be reduced by 1 in the process. Repairing the trident with Mending before you throw it is not required, but recommended, as tridents are very hard to get and relatively easy to break.

## It Spreads
Kill a mob near a Sculk Catalyst

Requirements: Kill a mob that drops experience within 8 blocks of a sculk catalyst.

First, you need a sculk catalyst. These spawn in deep dark biome, just like sculk sensors (see Sneak 100). However, no mobs (except for wardens) can spawn in this biome; some mobs spawned in nearby biomes may wander to the catalyst, but that creates a risk of attracting a warden. You can bring a bucket of fish to the catalyst and kill the fish; it should count. Alternatively you can pick up the catalyst and bring it somewhere else. To do that, you need to mine the catalyst with any tool that has Silk Touch enchantment.

Then, get out of deep dark and place the catalyst on the surface. You need to kill any mob that drops experience (except the ender dragon) within 8 blocks of the catalyst: it might be a hostile monster like zombie, or a passive mob like sheep. Mobs that will not work include baby animals, allays, iron golems, snow golems, villagers, wandering traders, and bats.

Once the mob dies, you will be granted the advancement, and some sculk will appear near the catalyst, replacing blocks in the ground.

## Take Aim
Shoot something with an arrow

Requirements: Hit any mob with a shot arrow.

Get a bow or a crossbow and at least one arrow. You can either craft them, or get a bow and arrows by killing skeletons, or get the crossbow from killing pillagers or piglins.

| Name     | Ingredients                                          | Crafting recipe |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Bow      | Stick+<br/>String                                    |                 |
| Crossbow | Stick+<br/>Iron Ingot+<br/>String+<br/>Tripwire Hook |                 |
| Arrow    | Flint+<br/>Stick+<br/>Feather                        | 4               |

Once you have those, shoot any mob to get the advancement: use the bow to charge it, aim at a mob, and release it. With the crossbow, hold use to load it, then release and press use again to fire it. One arrow will be consumed in the process, unless you have Infinity on your bow.

Once the arrow hits a mob, you will get the advancement.

The hardest mobs to kill for this challenge advancement are the bosses: ender dragon and wither. For tutorials on how to deal with them, see Tutorials/Defeating the ender dragon and Tutorials/Defeating the wither. Note that killing a warden is not required.

Other harder mobs include: elder guardians (found in ocean monuments), ravagers (spawn only during raids), evokers and vindicators (spawn only in woodland mansions and during raids), piglin brutes (found in bastions) and zoglins (you need to get a hoglin into the Overworld, this is made even harder by their fear of nether portals). All of these are somewhat rare and can deal lots of damage, so prepare before fighting them. More info about each of those is on their own pages, and also on the Tutorials/Combat page.

The player can track their progress by going to the "Mobs" section in their statistics. All mobs that are killed by the player (or have killed the player) at least once will be shown on the page.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 100 experience.
