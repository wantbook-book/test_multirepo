#### Hypermodern strategy
While the bartering strategy is simple and easy to understand, the hypermodern strategy overcomplicates every aspect of the run. However, it is necessary to learn because it is now the meta of 1.16+ speedruns; almost every speedrun has a coastal spawn with either a shipwreck, ruined portal, or buried treasure. Runner k4yfour has a good video on hypermodern runs: https://youtu.be/gAHMJfsrHe4.

The hypermodern strategy relies on an ocean with a shipwreck and a magma ravine, preferably having both close by and near each other.

Loot the chests in the wreck. One chest should have carrots and other foods, which sets you up for the option to make golden carrots later in the run. Another chest should have the seven iron you need to complete the run, plus a few other valuables. If it doesn't, the third chest contains a buried treasure map, and it should have the rest of the iron and decent food. Next, turn on hitboxes (F3 + B) to spot faraway kelp (this can indicate a magma ravine). Once you have found a magma ravine, create a ravine portal and enter the Nether that way (you can search up tutorials on ravine portals on YouTube).

TheTalkingMime has invented another strategy for hypermodern runs called "mapless buried treasure". The strategy relies on using a pie chart to show the (possible) location of a buried treasure without a map (hence the name). It is a complicated strategy in the way it works, but if done and understood properly, it can be extremely fast and efficient. To learn how to do this, watch his video: https://youtu.be/mes_PPlOJao.

The Nether is probably the hardest part of the run to get used to if you practice classic bartering strategies and warped forest strategies excessively, but it goes extremely fast if you can do it properly. There are also advanced techniques to finding structures (such as E-ray and pie-ray), which you can search the tutorials for on YouTube.

First, find a bastion. Bastions have a lot of piglins (depending on the type of bastion) and a lot of gold. There are four types of bastions: treasure bastions, bridge bastions, housing bastions, and stables bastions. This is important to know because knowing what type of bastion you have can help you plan your route accordingly. Couriway has a great video on bastions: https://youtu.be/5QIMHxpfUkg.

In a bastion, you generally want to aim for: at least 16 ender pearls (for the end portal and travelling), 21 obsidian (for blind travel and travelling in the Nether and for the one cycle), at least 48 string (to make beds), fire resistance potions (for the blaze fight), and crying obsidian and glowstone (to make respawn anchors if you don't get enough string). If you don't have enough of these items after bartering all of your gold, find chests and loot them. Once you have all the needed items, leave the bastion. The bastion process is quick; while the average player can do it in at most three minutes, skilled runners can do it under even two minutes.

When you find a fortress, drink/splash your fire resistance, then pearl to the spawner. Once you have finished your blaze fight, head to the Overworld by building a portal. You can now do educated travel; throw an eye of ender, take note of its angle, run 17.5 blocks perpendicular of that angle, throw another eye, take note of your angle, then note the angle difference. 1000 divided by the difference of these two angles gives you a rough estimate of where your stronghold is. This process can be quicker with the Ninjabrain Bot, as it tells you the exact position of the stronghold using trigonometry. (You can find all of these tutorials on YouTube.) Now, travel your distance divided by eight in the Nether (travelling in the Nether is eight times more efficient), although if you don't have enough obsidian you can still travel by Overworld if the distance to clear is less than 600 blocks. With a little luck, you may end up in, on, or near the stronghold. If not, do some more triangulation.

The end of the run is nothing different; find the portal room, fill it, hop in, and one cycle the ender dragon.

#### Warped forest strategy
This strategy is not recommended stand-alone if you are going for a world record or are bad at PvE. This ties in with the Looting strategy, however, it is not required to have Looting for this. It can be helpful if you want to get more pearls while the piglin barters.

First, look for a warped forest. It is easy to spot, with giant aquamarine trees and unnatural green foliage. When you arrive, look for and kill endermen, until you have the desired amount of pearls. If you are bad at PvE, you can pillar 2-3 blocks and then look at them to anger them, and if you are being chased by one and are low on health, you can try and jump up into a Twisting Vine to escape it. You can also tower up three blocks, as the enderman cannot reach that high, even if they are three blocks tall. A common strategy for killing Enderman is to trap one in a boat before killing it. This can be achieved either by placing a boat next to an enderman and having it run into the boat or by placing the boat one block higher than the surrounding area and anger them with the boat in between you and the enderman.  



This can take anywhere from under 3 to over 5-6 minutes, depending on spawn luck, pearl drops, skill at PvE, and whether or not you have looting on your weapons.
