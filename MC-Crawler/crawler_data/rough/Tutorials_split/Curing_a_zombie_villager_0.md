## About zombie villagers
Zombie villagers have a 5% chance to spawn in place of a regular zombie and can also spawn if a zombie kills a regular villager, depending on the difficulty level. (0% on Easy, 50% on Normal, and 100% on Hard)

You can also spawn zombie villagers via commands or using a spawn egg.

A villager and a zombie villager always spawn inside an igloo basement. Zombie villagers also naturally generate in zombie villages.

Zombie villagers have a similar appearance to normal villagers but have zombie-colored flesh and attempt to attack the player like other zombies.

In Bedrock Edition, zombie villagers also have a 5% chance to emerge from zombie spawners, and you can contrive to separate the zombie villagers from the zombies to collect them and heal them.

in Java Edition zombie villagers do not spawn from zombie monster spawners, so don't expect to get a zombie villager by waiting next to a monster spawner.

## Finding and crafting the equipment
### Splash Potion of Weakness
To create a Splash Potion of Weakness, it must be brewed using a brewing stand, which can either be crafted using blaze rods and cobblestone or found in an igloo basement, end ship or a cleric house in a village.

- To brew a Splash Potion of Weakness, you need:
	- 1fermented spider eye, which can be crafted withspider eyes,brown mushroomandsugar
	- 1 to 3water bottles, which can be obtained by right-clicking awater sourcewithglass bottles
	- 1gunpowder, which can be obtained fromcreepersandghastsor found in naturally-generated chests
	- 1blaze powderto fuel the brewing stand

Place the water bottle(s) and the fermented spider eye in the brewing stand, then insert the blaze powder in the fuel slot to initiate the brewing process. Once your potions of weakness have brewed, place in the gunpowder to convert them into splash potions of weakness.

A splash potion of weakness can also be found placed in igloo brewing stands.

### Lingering Potion of Weakness
To create a Lingering Potion of Weakness, it must be brewed using a brewing stand.

- To brew a Lingering Potion of Weakness, you need:
	- 1fermented spider eye, which can be crafted withspider eyes,brown mushroom, andsugar
	- 1 to 3water bottles, which can be obtained by right-clicking awater sourcewithglass bottles
	- 1gunpowder, which can be obtained fromcreepersandghastsor found in naturally-generated chests
	- 1dragon's breath, which can be obtained by scooping up theender dragon's breath attack ordragon fireballclouds in anempty bottle
	- 1blaze powderto fuel the brewing stand

Place the three water bottles and the fermented spider eye in the brewing stand, then insert the blaze powder to initiate the brewing process. Once your potions of weakness have brewed, place in the gunpowder to convert them into splash potions of weakness. Once your splash potions of weakness have brewed, place in the dragon's breath to convert them into lingering potions.

### Arrow of Weakness
An Arrow of Weakness can provide an alternative to splash potions of weakness and eliminate the risk of splashing yourself with the weakness potion; however, they are harder to obtain than splash potions.

To craft arrows of weakness, you must brew a lingering potion of weakness, which can be done by brewing a Splash Potions of Weakness with dragon's breath.

- Dragon's breath can be obtained by right-clicking (or long-pressing if in Bedrock Edition) theender dragondragon breath or dragon fireball clouds with an empty glass bottle in hand.
- Combine eight arrows and a Lingering Potion of Weakness in a crafting table, and craft eight Arrows of Weakness.

Alternatively, there are multiple methods to obtain arrows of weakness without having to fight the ender dragon:

- Arrows of weakness can be obtained by filing acauldronwith a Potion of Weakness and thenusingarrows on it. A full cauldron can treat the tips of a stack of arrows.â€Œ[Bedrock Edition  only]
- Arrows of weakness can be obtained through trades with master level fletcher villager.
- If the player has theHero of the Villageeffect, fletcher villagers can throw arrows of weakness as gifts to the player.{Java Edition only}

### Witch
Witches have a 25% chance of throwing a splash potion of weakness if the player is within 3 blocks of a witch and does not already have the Weakness status effect. While this method is more dangerous to attempt than others, this method can be used as an alternative if a player is not able to obtain a potion or arrow of weakness at the time.

Witches spawn in numerous ways, including:

- In theOverworldat the light level of 0. It spawns in all Overworldbiomesexceptmushroom fieldsanddeep dark.
- In aswamp hutlocated inswampbiomes.
- When an adult or babyvillageris within 4 blocks of a lightning strike.
