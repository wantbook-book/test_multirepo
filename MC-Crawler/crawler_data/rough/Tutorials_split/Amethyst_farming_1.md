### Hole method
This method is extremely efficient, and you won't need to worry about items despawning.

What you will need:

- Some blocks
- Some water
- Some torches
- Resources to make a collection system

First you will need to build 1 floor, but make sure that it is at least 5 blocks over the highest block of amethyst. Then you will need to make a hole in the floor where a block of budding amethyst is directly below it and repeat that until directly above every block of budding amethyst there is a hole. You can now place a water bucket in each hole. This will allow you to access the budding amethyst without blocking any over it, so that the collection system can pick it up.
Now you will need to build the collection system itself on the bottom floor which is under the blocks of amethyst (you will have needed to dug out the area first). You can do the system however you want, with water flowing for example, which pushes the amethyst shards over a minecart with hopper system which collects it and funnels it into a chest. The last step is to light up the area.
To use the farm you need to wait for the amethyst to grow, and to harvest you need to swim down each hole and harvest all the amethyst there. If you drop any amethyst it will be collected, so despawning is not a problem.

## Automatic farming
There are a few approaches to making an automatic amethyst farm. All approaches require a timer of 167 minutes, the statistically optimal period based on the random tick rate.[1] (As Redstone Comparator does not read the growth stage, the only way to know the stage is an Observer linked to a counting circuit. There's no chance for such a circuit to fit in a limited space, so probabilistic pushing is the best option.)

- The simplest is to have a piston for each side pushing shards into a hopper. For an example design, see Gecko's video.[2]
- The ultimate efficiency in Amethyst farming comes from a flying machine system clearing every bud. Designing such a system is very difficult, however. A mod called "geodesy" is designed to help with calculating block placement for the flying machine.[3]
