#### Method 5
[Bug Used: MC-84198] (fixed)

This method requires that the player has already journeyed to the End and reached the outer End islands. This is very important.

To use this method, you need the following materials:

- at least 1chorus fruit
- up to 40 stacks of any type ofblocks

First, fill in an area that is 17Ã—17 blocks by 9 blocks high against the bedrock ceiling. The netherrack and bedrock that generates naturally can be used to fill in this region: only remaining air blocks need to be filled. Once this happens, stand in the middle of the top of this filled-in area (against the bedrock ceiling), and record your coordinates. Then, eat the chorus fruit. If the player is not teleported on top of the bedrock, eat another chorus fruit until you are successful. It works using a chorus fruit's teleportation ability and removing all other valid places for the player to teleport to. [verify]

Pros:

- It can be reversed by placing another region of blocks with 8 blocks in each direction on top of the bedrock ceiling, and then eating anotherchorus fruit.
- It is easy to accomplish.

Cons:

- It requires that theplayerhas already journeyed to the outerEndislands to harvestchorus fruit.
- The chance of success is random, so it is possible that it will take a huge quantity ofchorus fruit.

#### Method 6
[Bug Used: MC-3328] (fixed)

This method is cheap, but also has the highest chance of death. It has two variations, depending on how quick you are with placing blocks.

To use this method, you need the following materials:

- 1rail
- 1 solidblock
- 1minecart
- 1-2ender pearls
- Helmetenchanted withRespirationor Protection or aqua affinity (recommended, but not required)

Dig up to the highest level of bedrock (y = 127). Place a block (if needed) two blocks below it, and then place the rail on top of this block. There should be no gap between the rail and the upper layer of bedrock. Next, place a minecart on the rail. This is where it gets dangerous, and where the Respiration-enchanted helmet comes into play. Get inside the minecart and quickly dismount it. The player should be suffocating in the bedrock layer. Next, hold down the "jump" key and throw an ender pearl directly up. In case of this failing, throw another ender pearl directly upward. It works by having the minecart dismount the player in a position where the player will be able to jump and see the top of the bedrock. The ender pearls move the player to the top.

Pros:

- It is very cheap and could be done early in the game

Cons:

- If the player runs out of ender pearls, it is stuck in thebedrockceiling with absolutely no method of escape.
- There is an extremely high possibility ofdeath, and the drops will most likely land on top of the bedrock.
- It is hard to accomplish

#### Method 6b
[Bug Used: MC-3328] (fixed)

This variation use the same resources and:

- 1 morerail(any kind)
- 1 moreminecart
- 1slab
- 1piston
- 1lever

Begin in the same way as in Method 4: Place the first minecart just under the bedrock ceiling as in Method 4, enter the minecart, and then exit the minecart. You will begin suffocating in the bedrock ceiling. From there, jump up and down so that you can see the top of the bedrock. Place a rail on top of the bedrock, preferably close to where you will be coming out. Next, place a minecart on top of the rail and quickly ride it. You will be teleported to the top of the bedrock ceiling into the minecart and can exit without further risk of suffocation.

Pros:

- It is not as dangerous as using ender pearls; only suffocation damage is taken, not fall damage.
- Though uncomfortable, it can be used as part of a minecart elevator to get above the bedrock until the player gets the necessary tools to break the bedrock.

Cons:

- Depending on how close the rail was placed, it can be difficult to place the minecart and get inside it without the minecart being pushed off, though the player can still enter the minecart if it is still in range.
- It is easy to lose the exact location of where the player came up. Using the F3 screen (Java edition) to note the exact coordinates mitigates this.

#### Method 6c
[Bug Used: MC-3328] (fixed)

This variation requires an extra minecart, one piston, one slab, and one lever.

Begin in the same way as in Method 4: place a minecart under the bedrock ceiling, then break the rail under the minecart. Place the piston to face the minecart with one air block between them. On the space between the piston and the minecart, place a lower slab. Activate the piston to push the slab right on the minecart. Then break the piston and the lever. Enter the minecart, and dismount it quickly. You now should be glitched through the bedrock block without taking any further damage. Now finish like in method 2: place a rail and a minecart (or alternately, place a boat) and jump in.

Pros:

- It is not as dangerous as the previous methods; the only suffocation damage is taken when you jump in the first minecart.
- You do not need to react quickly.

Cons:

- It may be difficult to find an appropriate place in the roof to put it in place.
- It is easy to lose the exact location of where the player came up. Using the F3 screen (Java edition) to note the exact coordinates mitigates this.

### Method 7
Place a piston down just below topmost Bedrock layer so that it is pointing upwards. Place a rail on top of it, place a minecart on the rail and destroy the rail. Extend the piston so that it crushes the minecart slightly into the Bedrock. Jump in the minecart and dismount. You should be suffocating inside the Bedrock. Jump twice and you should end up above the Bedrock. After that, use the glitched minecart to go down. This glitch is for 18w11a only.
