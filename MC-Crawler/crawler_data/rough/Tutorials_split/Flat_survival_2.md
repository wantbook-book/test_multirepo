## Getting unlimited water
Once you have a steady supply of wood and have become adept at killing zombies in your mob farm, you can focus on your next goal: creating an infinite water.

As you kill zombies, you slowly collect iron ingots. Your top priority is to create a cauldron, which requires 7 ingots.

As soon as you get 7 ingots, craft a cauldron and put it down somewhere exposed to the sky, so that it can fill up with water the next time it rains. If you already have three water bottles dropped from witches, you can fill the cauldron immediately.

Get three more ingots to craft a bucket. Once you have a bucket, use it to pick up the water from the cauldron and transfer this water to a hole in the ground to create a water source block. You need more water to make an infinite water source. There are three ways to get more water:

- Wait for another rain.
- Use threewater bottlesdropped from witches to re-fill the cauldron.
- Use a singleglass bottle(dropped from awitch) on your source water block in the ground to fill the bottle. Transfer the water to the cauldron. Do this three times to fill the cauldron. The water source block on the ground is unaffected and you end up with a cauldron full of water again.

2×2 water spawner (every corner is renewable)
Once you have a water bucket and a cauldron full of water at the same time, you can make an infinite water source to get unlimited water source blocks. The most convenient configuration is a 2×2 hole in the ground, one block deep. Use the bucket to place water in two diagonally-opposite corners of this hole to create four water source blocks, one in each corner. If two water source blocks flow into an empty space, another source block is created. A 2×2 hole lets you remove water from any corner, which gets replaced immediately. You can also make a 1×3 straight trench or a 2×2 L-shaped trench, but then only the middle block can be removed. If you remove one of the end blocks, you can't get more water.

Once you have your water production hole, take water from it to produce a pond for fishing, using a fishing rod that you craft from sticks and string obtained from spiders you killed.

You can fish from a location above the pond where mobs cannot bother you, or fish from a boat. If you make the pond 2 blocks deep, and your fishing rod's bobber has water 2 blocks deep for horizontal distance 2 blocks around it, you also have a chance to fish up other items, like bowls for making stew if you have beetroots or both red and brown mushrooms, saddles for taming horses and donkeys, and even enchanted fishing rods.

Raw fish isn't as high-quality a food as raw meat, but it's plentiful and less effort to obtain. Punching animals drains your hunger bar. Your hunger doesn't change at all when fishing from a boat; you can do that indefinitely without eating, as long as you don't get attacked.

Congratulations! You now have an easy, unlimited supply of food and additional resources. This is a significant milestone on the way to a comfortable life. Take some time to relax, collect a few stacks of fish so you can eat on the run without needing to hunt animals, tidy up your area and your inventory, make some nice living quarters. If you plan to get villagers, you can start planning and constructing some village buildings, although getting a villager is a huge next step, even more difficult than what you've just lived through to get to this point.

## Creating a village
Once you have unlimited water available, you can work on creating a village, which requires villagers. There is a large cascade of dependencies here:

- To get a villager, you need to cure azombie villager.
- To cure a zombie villager, you need agolden appleand asplash potionofWeakness. You cannot obtain the potion; it must be thrown by awitch.
- To get a golden apple, you need 8gold ingots.
- To get gold ingots, you need to killzombified piglins, which sometimes drop ingots.
- To get zombified piglins,lightningmust strike nearpigs.
- To get lightning to strike near a bunch of pigs, you need alightning rod.
- A lightning rod requirescopper ingots.
- Copper ingots require you to killdrowned, which sometimes drop ingots.
- Drowned are created from zombies drowning in water you created.

The success of some of these steps depends strongly on luck:

- Drowned rarely drop copper ingots. You need to kill a lot of them.
- Once you get a lightning rod, you may have to wait a long time for athunderstorm.
- Zombified piglins don't normally drop gold ingots. And when you attack one of them, they attack you all at once. If you are fighting a crowd of them, and it takes more than 5 minutes to clear them out, some ingots they drop may despawn. You likely need at least 200 zombified piglins to get the 16 gold ingots required to make two golden apples.
- Zombie villagers and witches are uncommon spawns. If they do spawn, you need to trap them inboatsnear enough to one another that the witch can hit the zombie villager with a splash potion.
- Witches throw potions of Weakness only rarely. And if you happen to venture 32 blocks away from the witch, it despawns.

If, after working through all this and getting lucky enough, you may find yourself with two villagers. You can breed them to get more.

Protect your villagers! Surround them (or the village you build for them) by a fence to prevent any zombies from attacking them. A hostile mob can come up to the fence but not cross it. Be sure the villagers can never access horizontal surfaces that mobs can spawn on. Dirt path blocks should be everywhere the villagers can be. You can make sleeping huts from dirt and wood, but be sure the roofs and the tops of any roofless walls have no spawnable surfaces; line the tops of walls with wooden stairs, bottom slabs, or dirt path blocks.
