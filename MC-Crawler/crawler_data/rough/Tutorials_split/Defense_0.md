# Tutorials/Defense
Some of the best defense measures are those that prevent hostile mobs from spawning entirely or at least prevent hostile mobs from ever getting close to the protected area or defense mechanism. As such, integral to all Minecraft defense systems:

## Passive Defenses
Passive defenses prevent hostile mobs from entering the protected area without any input or sensory devices. The most common example is walls: they do not have to sense a mob coming or sense its position to prevent it from entering a walled off area. The following sections discuss various types of passive defenses, their construction, maintenance, and applicability.

Passive defenses generally fall into one or more categories, sorted by their impact on an aggressive force. 

- Delayersslow down the progress of an enemy inwards. A ring oftorchesis a delayer because it increases the distancemobsmust spawn from the structure (and player), thus increasing the time it takes for them to reach the next layer of defense.Soul sand,slime blocks,honey blocksand slowness potion turrets are also delayers because it reduces the movement speed of anything moving on it, including mobs. Mobs avoid walking onhoney blocksand prevent entities from jumping.
- Obstaclesare structures that mobs cannot move past without somehow overcoming them. The quintessential obstacle is a wall; a zombie cannot move past a wall without somehow creating a breach or slipping in through an unclosed door.
- Damagerscause harm to an enemy, in addition to just stopping or slowing them down. They might also do neither, letting the mob through without a reduction in speed, but hitting them for damage as they pass. Currently, damagers either inflict direct hit point damage on amobor set them onfire. If additional status effects are added for example, if theplayercan create a block, which poisons anything that moves over it, these would also fall into this category. A damaging delayer could be a moat oflava; while a damaging obstacle could be a wall ofcacti.

It is important to note that each mob type will treat each defense differently; for example, a ring of burning netherrack does damage to most mobs but is not at all effective against zombie pigmen. Likewise, a wall is an obstacle to a creeper, but is only a delayer to a spider (and not a very effective one at that).

### Walls
Walls are simple vertical barriers and are the most common means of stopping mobs from entering an area. They can be constructed of just about any material, with varying advantages and disadvantages.

These are simple to make, just make sure to:

- Make them at least 3 blocks high
- Add an extension around the outside to defend againstspiders.(consider making it out ofglassor another clear block sozombiesandskeletonscannot use it to take cover from the sun).
- Torchesshould be added to the top or sides of the wall, unless low visibility is desired (for example, to reduce the chance of other players noticing a camouflaged wall on a multiplayer server). Torches will prevent unwantedmobsfrom spawning near a player's wall, and provide a source of light.
- Ditches or moats can be added on the inside or outside the wall as an extra barrier.Cactuscan also damage mobs, so placing it is an effective defense.

#### Materials
Cobblestone and dirt are the most common materials for making walls, due to their abundance and ease of obtaining. Walls made in desert biomes may also be made of sand or sandstone.

While dirt does not resist explosions well, it is suitable for most purposes. Both dirt and sand walls are frequently used to surround "first night" shelters. 

Cobblestone and stone are the preferred materials for established miners. They have respectable blast resistance, while being plentiful. 

Sandstone is only marginally better than sand, and should be avoided except for aesthetic reasons.

Glass, ice, fences, fence gates, glass panes, and iron bars are useful as they can be seen through, revealing threats on the other side without exposure. These blocks can also be used to view endermen without attracting their aggression. However, these blocks are vulnerable to damage by creeper explosions. 

The ultimate in wall construction without cheats or ops privileges is obsidian. When constructing, it is faster to position buckets of lava and cool them with water than it is to cool a pool of lava and mine it. 

Although walls are not necessary in creative mode, an indestructible wall would be made mostly or entirely out of obsidian and/or bedrock. Barrier blocks are useful when commands are allowed.

If the player spawns near a desert, it is quite easy to make a wall of cacti, provided the rules for cactus placement are followed. One cactus block will be required on each sand block, which will then grow to be 3 blocks tall, and damaging to mobs which run into it.

Fences are also good for a wall, as even though they appear to be 1 block tall, their collision box is 1.5 blocks tall, making it impossible for mobs to jump over them.

Walls are not effective against spiders and cave spiders, as they can move vertically. However, the addition of protrusions and overhangs on the wall will prevent the spiders from climbing further. A fence as the center block of a wall also prevents spiders while providing no shade for undead mobs. Make this high enough for the fall to deal damage on the spider, unless if low on resources.
