### Stable
These are where you keep your horses for easy riding, and normally are about 10 blocks wide. Fences and leads can be used for keeping your horses in the stable.

## Multiplayer-only ideas
These ideas are quite pointless if you play by yourself, but are fun additions to a multiplayer server.

### Cornucopia
The cornucopia is probably one of the most simple "structures" on this list. It basically consists of a storage area where anyone can give away and take any item for free, and can range from a single chest or barrel located off a main road to an elaborate structure of stacked double chests in a central square. Rules are optional but recommended; basic rules include prohibiting taking everything from the cornucopia, requiring each player to give an item of similar or greater quantity, value, or purpose to what they have taken (such as exchanging cooked cod for cooked rabbit, or potions for miscellaneous potion ingredients), only giving and taking what a player actually needs, or limiting what is allowed in the cornucopia (such as prohibiting tools of iron and better, or limiting food to a stack of 16).

### Party room
This is a large room (or multiple small rooms). You can have a table and chairs or a bar and you can charge people to have a party there. Include jukeboxes with music discs and perhaps colored carpet.

### Mailbox
Simply put a chest/barrel on top of a fence post, then other players can give you gifts. Be wary of thieves! Alternatively, you can leave messages as books.

### Bank
Make a bank to store items. Players could pay gold or diamond to store their valuable items in a 'vault'. If you're really ambitious, the Vault could be lined with lava or obsidian (or bedrock if you're an Admin) to make it super secure.

### Tollhouse
For bridges/roads that lead to your property, or for entrances and exits to spawns and player hubs. Only works effectively with some sort of fence or wall around the area.

### Inn or guesthouse
Build a large and well-defended structure with private rooms each containing a bed and chest (possibly a furnace and crafting table too). For additional style points, decorate the rooms nicely. Use a locking mod, and charge people to stay at the inn; when they rent a room, add them to the list of people who can unlock the door and chest. You may want to hire people to man the front desk, keep records and collect bills. This is especially useful if you build it near a dungeon, as players want to have a well-protected "base camp" when setting off to explore.

### Army
Make an army from other players. People can pay the army in valuables to protect their homes. Charge based on location and how long.

### National park
Corner off a huge area of land with big mountains and amazing caves on a multiplayer server. Put in information signs for landmarks and charge people to visit. Make some camp-sites to house players while exploring, and put chests with food or weapons in the camp-sites. Be sure that players give back any items they use.

### Multiplayer railway
Charge other players to ride on it, a perfect way to get coal or emeralds. Make a deluxe version for long journeys. Make windows in the tunnel. Another idea is to make a subway. See Tutorials/Train station for more information.

### Spleef arena
Great way to have some fun with your friends on multiplayer. You should make a snow golem room to be able to collect snow balls easy to craft into snow blocks. You can bet on games, build a score board and have stands for people to watch. You can also make it so the loser faces a little more punishment and humiliation by making the bottom out of lava so if someone falls they burn to death. This makes it a little more fun and pleasurable to watch your opponent burn. You could also make a long drop that kills the loser, and the winner can take all the dropped items after the game.

### PvP combat arena
Create a huge room and fill it with obstacles and platforms. Make a roof with beds on it, that players can respawn in, and chests to take equipment from. Make holes in the roof to allow players to enter the arena at different places. Use ladders or water holes to prevent falling damage. You can give the arena a theme, like a forest, and decide what equipment should be available when players respawn.

### Courtroom
Useful on any server with a problem with griefers, stealing, or PvP (player vs player). If an admin is online (or with use of a command block), it is advised to turn everyone present to adventure mode and separate them, to prevent PvP and/or griefing of the courtroom. A courtroom usually involves a chair or place for the judge, the jury, the defendant, and other players wishing to speak. It is much easier to maintain a trial with everyone there in the Courtroom rather than just over chat, as there are no distractions and the defendant and others can be kept under control. Depending on the government system chosen, the jury can vote on the punishment, or the final say can be up to the judge. Due to number restraints, it can be hard to have a completely unbiased jury, but try to have at least one person who wasn't involved or biased. If the defendant is deemed guilty, a punishment is decided, which can range from having to give back what they stole or repair the damage griefed, to a restraining order, a banishment from the town, or even being banned from the server. Optionally, you can have a Records Room to keep track of the trail using a book and quill (just be wary of offenders trying to clear their name by destroying the book or editing it), but can also be tracked with .txt files outside the game (which might be a better idea if things are really getting out of hand).
