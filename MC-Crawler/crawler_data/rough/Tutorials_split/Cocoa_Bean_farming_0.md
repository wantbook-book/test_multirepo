# Tutorials/Cocoa Bean farming
Cocoa beans can grow on the sides of any jungle log, regardless of light level, requiring 1 empty air block in the space it will occupy. The jungle log does not need to be attached to a living tree: any jungle log block will do. Therefore, it is easy to create large farms for cocoa beans by chopping down jungle trees and arranging the wood to optimize growing space.

## Farming
An optimal arrangement for a non-automated cocoa bean farm is:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

This can be repeated vertically and horizontally (overlap by 1 square horizontally or laterally when repeating this pattern) to create larger farms. Vertical farms are more space and yield efficient, but they become more difficult to replant and harvest the taller they are. Bear in mind in your farm design that you cannot reach more than 6 blocks up and 4 blocks down from the block on which you are standing, so balancing simplicity of planting/harvesting and maximum yield involves a trench 4 blocks deep and jungle wood blocks protruding 6 blocks above ground.

Cocoa beans will break if the bean itself is hit by the player or a piston, if the jungle wood itself is pushed by a piston, if water tries to flow into the same space as the growing bean, or if the jungle wood block is destroyed. All automated harvesting relies on these methods. Theoretically, TNT would also remove the beans, but it would be costly to implement and difficult to replant.

Alternatively, a slightly less growing space efficient but overall easier and higher yield design is to build a wall of any arbitrary width, covering both sides with cocoa plants. This is simpler to plant and harvest, as you are only working in 2 dimensions. Additionally, the player now has room to put scaffolding, ladders, or any other climbable blocks, allowing the wall to be of any height instead of being capped at 10.

Bear in mind that extremely large farms are impractical and unnecessary given the speed at which cocoa pods grow and the overall yield of beans from a relatively small planting. Pods grow quickly, achieving maturity in minutes, each yielding up to 3 beans, each bean making 8 cookies or dying 1 wool brown. At about 80% pod maturity, you will almost always see at least a 200% return on your planting.

## Mechanisms
No designs for a fully automatic farm are available at this time as you are required to manually place cocoa beans on the jungle log to plant pods. However, semi-automatic farms that harvest automatically but still require manual planting are possible and relatively cheap to build.

By far, pistons are the most popular device for automated harvesting. Formerly, there was another major variation of the semi-automatic farm: water-harvested. However, it was broken as of the Update Aquatic due to the waterlogging mechanics, as water can now pass though cocoa without breaking it.

Piston harvested farms use a single line of jungle logs, planted on all 4 sides with cocoa plants. Pistons either push the trunk, causing the grown beans to be removed, or scrape the beans from the trunk. (Other designs raise and lower the trunk in rapid succession; but these utilize more complex redstone circuits and are not significantly more useful, cheap or efficient than simpler designs.) Piston designs suffer from universally low yields, somewhat expensive and complex circuit design (compared to alternatives) and general space inefficiency.

Water-harvested farms may also have a single block trunk of some height, but a much higher yield is possible by building walls and allowing the water to cascade over them to scrape off the pods.
