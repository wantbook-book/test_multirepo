### Final Tips
Keep these in mind as you become the top faction:

- If you want to keep people not in your faction out of an area of your base, put doors in front of it. Allied faction members can't open doors unless they have pressure plates in front of them.
- Read up on historical military strategies. Although they're from real life, many principles still apply to factions warfare and may just help you outsmart the competition.
- Ally, ally, ally! You don't have to fight everyone. Make some friends as you go. Conquest is always more fun when it's shared with good friends.
- Obsidian is essentially bedrock in claimed areas, unless the server has a plugin that lets it be blown up.
- Your defense is only as strong as its weakest link. Any weak spots in your defenses WILL be found by your enemies, and it WILL be exploited so much it will boggle your mind. One missing block of obsidian or one mine that isn't claimed at the entrance and sealed off by a door can be your downfall.
- You'll most likely forget to obsidian the floor when you're obsidian covering your base. It's an easy mistake to make. Make sure you do that. Otherwise, raiders can dig up through the floor of your base.
- If you wish to have a way out of any sticky situations with other players, a hidden nether portal transport like the kind referenced earlier can be used as a quick escape route. Since 1 block in the nether is a greater distance than in the overworld, if worst comes to worst, you can activate your hidden piston door, head through your portal, and run down a corridor to get away from your opponents quicker than they can catch up to you, assuming they don't find your portal. You can also use minecarts (or a human cannon) for this.
- Experiment! Combine anti-griefing techniques together! Use a boat/minecart to transport an elder guardian through nether portals, into a 5-block-thick obsidian bunker surrounded by lava and half-open wither cages, placed on top of the nether! This definitely will stop all the raiders in the world!

## Raiding
Now that you have learned how to defend from raiders, you want to read up on how to do some raiding of your own! First, you must do some planning before you stage a raid. 

- Step 1-Find Your Target

You need to find the enemy's base. This may be the hardest part. Send out trackers and spies to find any enemy activity. Then hunt relentlessly and look into any odd landscaping or other signs. Signs can be things like flatter-than-usual mountainsides indicating Jeb doors, 1Ã—1 lava pits that may cover a pressure plate, and weird landscaping (hills in a flat biome). One good tip is to always be suspicious. Or, if you get raided, just stalk the retreating attackers home.

- Step 2-Analyze The Defenses

Look at everything you can see from the outside. If the defenses are similar to yours, then think about weak spots you have (or had) in the defenses. Also, take note of the biome and defenses to figure out what gear to bring along. Then think of a rough draft of the attack plan. Will you drop down from the nearby higher terrain to glide in with elytra? Or will you use Potion of Invisibility and Depth Strider III to knock a hole in their underwater glass wall? Get creative with your plan!

- Step 3-Organize The Raid

Use all the information you have gathered to organize a raid.

- Step 4-The Actual Raid

First of all, don't expect to win. They may have a secret last-ditch trump card you overlooked. Maybe, they had more organized anti-raid drills or possibly you just lost for no particular reason. Don't call it a total loss! You probably brought something of theirs home with you. You may win some other raid someday, but always remember, if you raid a faction's base, they will fix the weak spot, and you will have to adapt and overcome.

#### Raid examples
Note: These are not the only ways to defeat the enemy. These are just examples.

##### 1: The Above-Ground Castle
Your enemy has built this base on top of an extreme hills. They have a giant wolf army and landmines around the walls. 

Send someone with elytra to scout their base before you fight them. When you have prepared your best equipment, go over there. Destroy all the landmines, and break through the walls. Don't let the enemy attack you, or their wolves will kill you. Bring as many people as possible to fight the wolves/players. Once the base is defeated, take the loot.

##### 2: The Flying Sky Base
Your enemy's base is in the sky, on a floating island. There are 5-block thick walls, with an obsidian layer, a liquid layer, and a checkerboard layer. All the players are inside, and their dispensers are filled with lava, to pour on raiders trying to pillar up. There are traps on all the chests, and the enemies have Punch II bows, splash potions, and Channeling tridents. When you go raid the base, it is a thunderstorm and no one will sleep through it.

Have people with elytra scout out the base. For the actual raid, have everyone bring elytra, and a few shields, as the enemies use ranged attacks. Kill the enemies by shooting them with a bow, or splashing them back. If possible, have someone with invisibility sneak in and do some critical hits. Your enemies will be too late to notice that you were invisible behind them with a Sharpness V/Fire Aspect II/Sweeping Edge III netherite sword. Once the enemies are dead, pillage the base and destroy the defenses. Fly away with the loot you have taken.

##### 3: The Massive Cave Base
Your enemy's base is underground, surrounded by 3 layers of obsidian. There is an elder guardian inside the base inflicting mining fatigue. The owners of the base have trapped chests leading to arrow dispensers. The secret room has a trapped chest, which is linked to dispensers on all sides, and will shoot splash potions of harming. One of the owners is in the base, while everyone else is exploring. 

Have everyone dig for the base until they find obsidian. If you get mining fatigue, you can spawn a wither, as it is unaffected by mining fatigue. Run away and have the wither blow up the walls. When the wither has blown up the walls, enter the base, and try to take as much loot. Lure the wither into the secret room, and have it blow up the traps. Make sure it doesn't blow up the chest. Take as much loot as you can. Don't kill the wither. Heal it with potions of harming, run away, and have it kill the enemy base owners.
