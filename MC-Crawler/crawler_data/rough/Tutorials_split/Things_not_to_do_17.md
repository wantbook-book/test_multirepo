#### Using coal blocks when unnecessary
A coal block burns for 16 thousand ticks, which is equivalent to 800 seconds (13 minutes 20 seconds). A piece of coal burns 1600 ticks- that means a coal block is giving out an equal energy and burning time of 10 coal, despite the fact that a coal block is crafted with 9 coal. This may seem like a good deal, but however, one coal block is able to burn 80 items; that means if you do not have 80 items to smelt, you wind up wasting some of the coal. If you plan to smelt fewer items, coal blocks should be crafted back into coal first. You can get more info here.

#### Making Planks when you need Charcoal
Charcoal is made from logs, not from planks; if you make planks from a log, you cannot use them as the top ingredients to get charcoal.

#### Mining budding amethyst blocks
Budding amethyst is unobtainable in Survival and is the only source of amethyst buds, clusters, and shards. This block can be hard to make out in an amethyst geode among all the normal amethyst blocks, but it has an X-shaped crack on each face and is often seen growing amethyst buds or clusters. To farm amethyst, it is advisable to mine out all the blocks touching each face of a budding amethyst block (unless it is another budding block) and allow each face to grow shards. As this can only be done in the geode in which the budding blocks are found, noting down the coordinates or building a distinct landmark would be a good idea.

#### Using Fire Protection as your main resistance from fire
Fire Protection can get you out of a bind in clutch situations. However, a Fire Resistance potion is almost always better to use, as it completely negates lava and fire damage. That, and only one type of Protection is available per piece of armor, locking out other, more viable options such as Protection and Blast Protection.

### Involving blocks and entities
#### Not killing passive mobs with flint and steel when safe and available
If the player is already carrying flint and steel while they are hunting, they should save themselves some time. When hunting a mob that yields meat (porkchops, chicken, steak, mutton, rabbit), using a flint and steel cooks the meat for the player. This is especially useful on chickens, since they are easy to kill and the fact that raw chicken is not as useful, as it can inflict food poisoning. The player saves furnace fuel and time they would have spent cooking it, and also, a flint and steel cost less to make than most weapons, so it is even more efficient than Fire Aspect or Flame. When using this tip, the player should be careful not to set fire to themselves, or to try it on mobs near water. The player can also be more efficient by setting multiple animals on fire with the same flame. The player should watch out for wooden houses or trees while using this technique. 

Lava also works similarly to flint and steel except that it does not have any durability and it spreads, requiring the player to quickly remove it. Also, lava is more damaging to the player than regular fire, so be even more careful when using lava. It could also burn the dropped meat by the animals.

The player should be careful using these methods in an animal farm since this tactic would kill the player's entire animal farm, and at least 2 animals are needed for reproduction. A good idea is to let a few of the animals out of the pen and then set fire to those animals.

If the player has a sword with the Looting enchantment, they may want to use it for killing animals as it provides a higher drop rate than regular weapons. Some may deem this far more useful of a tactic than the other suggestions due to the ease of collecting furnace fuel. The player should not use flint and steel or lava for killing animals if they want the experience points earned from killing animals or the raw form of an animal's meat.

#### Using swords in animal farms

  

This tutorial is exclusive to  Java Edition.Â 


In the Java Edition, swords have a sweep attack that can hit several targets at once. This is useful when fighting monsters, but can cause problems when slaughtering animals, especially in a crowded ranch. When trying to kill one mob, the player may accidentally hit or even kill another mob standing next to it, particularly with Sweeping Edge. This can be avoided by using an axe instead of a sword, which has the added bonus of getting the job done in fewer hits. The player should remember that an axe hits slower than a sword.

However, there is a benefit to using a sword instead of an axe to slaughter animals when the sword is enchanted with Looting or Fire Aspect, as these enchantments are unavailable to axes in survival and can cause additional resources to drop from the animals you kill or cook meat without having to do so in a furnace, respectively. To avoid doing a sweep attack with a sword, either attack the animal while sprinting or jump and attack the animals in midair, as doing either of these actions prevent a sweep attack from occurring. In addition, attacking animals while falling after a jump causes a critical hit, which can provide enough of a damage boost to kill the animal in a single strike.

#### 
When fighting magma cubes, it can be a good idea to use sweeping edge or the sword sweep attack to kill multiple tiny cubes in one hit, but that can cause problems when you are near zombified or regular piglins. An accidental hit makes the other piglins angry at you and both types of piglins are powerful, especially if you anger a piglin brute and they can finish you in a few hits if your armor is not good enough.
