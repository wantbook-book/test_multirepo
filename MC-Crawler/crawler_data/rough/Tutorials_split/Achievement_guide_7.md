### Rabbit Season

Goal: Cook and eat rabbit meat.

You are going to need some raw rabbit to earn this achievement, so kill rabbits until you get at least one raw rabbit. Then cook it in a furnace, smoker, or campfire. When cooking with a campfire, you do not require fuel, so after a short time the food will cook itself.

### The Deep End

### Great View From Up Here

Goal: Levitate up 50 blocks from the attacks of a Shulker.

First, you need to enter an end gateway, using water to swim through one block gap or by throwing ender pearl.

Once you teleported to outer islands, you need to find end city, where shulker can be found.

When shulkers shoot shulker bullets, move toward the bullet and let it hurt you, then you start to levitate, but you need to take damage of some bullet as a single bullet won't levitate high enough, and make sure there is no block above you. Because you will take some damage from the bullet, it's recommended to wear armor with Projectile Protection IV on all armor pieces. As you will fall down when the effect ends, your boots should be enchanted with Feather Falling IV, and/or drink potion of Slow Falling or eat a chorus fruit so it completely negates all fall damage. To brew potion of Slow Falling, you need phantom membrane dropped by phantom which can only spawn after the player has not slept for at least 3 days.

| Ingredients                     | Input » Output |
|---------------------------------|----------------|
| Awkward Potion+Phantom Membrane |                |

Then, extends it using redstone dust:

| Ingredients                          | Input » Output |
|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| Potion of Slow Falling+Redstone Dust |                |



### Super Sonic

Goal: Fly with the Elytra through a 1 by 1 gap while moving faster than 40 m/s 

First, you need to find elytra in an end city. End cities have a chance of generating end ships, which is where elytra can be found. It is on item frame guarded by a shulker. Use an ender pearl to teleport there or utilize a shulker bullet.

Once you have elytra, wear it in the chestplate slot. You can glide now by press jump while falling.

To make your flying speed higher, you need fireworks. Recommended to craft using 3 gunpowder, so it will boost longer.

| Ingredients     | Input » Output |
