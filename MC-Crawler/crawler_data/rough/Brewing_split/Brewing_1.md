## Brewing recipes
### Base potions
Base potions are potions without effects, brewed by adding a single base ingredient to a water bottle. Of these, only the awkward potion can be imbued with an effect ingredient to produce a potion effect.

| Potion              | Reagent, base | Precursor to   |
|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| <br/>Awkward potion |               | Effect potions |
| <br/>Mundane potion |               | None           |
| <br/>Thick potion   |               | None           |

### Effect potions
Effect potions are primarily created by adding an effect ingredient to an awkward potion, which is created by adding nether wart to a water bottle. Certain effects require a potion to be corrupted by a fermented spider eye. The potion of Weakness can additionally be created by simply adding a fermented spider eye to a water bottle, and it is the only potion that can be brewed without nether wart.

Undead mobs react differently to effects than other mobs. They take damage from potions of Healing, gain health from potions of Harming, and are unaffected by potions of Poison and Regeneration.
