## Mobs


Main article: Trial Spawner § Mob spawning
Natural hostile mob spawning is disabled within a trial chamber. Mobs spawn only from the trial spawners. The number of mobs spawned scales with the number of players in range of each spawner, and breezes are spawned less per spawner and per player than other mobs. See § Trial Spawners above for information on which mobs spawn in which spawners.



## Loot
See also: Chest loot

Loot is available from vaults, chests, barrels, dispensers and decorated pots from within the chambers. Players who defeat a trial spawner each receive rewards; this loot scales depending on the amount of people who defeat the trial spawner.
