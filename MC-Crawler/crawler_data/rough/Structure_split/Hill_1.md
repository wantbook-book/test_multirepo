#### Iceberg
This article is about a terrain feature known as iceberg.  For a feature called iceberg, see Iceberg (feature).
A large iceberg is a large terrain feature composed of packed ice and snow blocks. There is also a smaller feature known as an cone iceberg.

Large icebergs generate in frozen oceans and deep frozen oceans. They consist of packed ice, and can be topped with snow block. Icebergs generate in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, ranging from small islands to giant mountain-like icebergs. They can also generate with cave-like holes (these might be related to the carved recesses in cone icebergs) [more information needed] in them, which sometimes pass through to the other side of the iceberg.

There are often blue ice features attached to them.

### Carvers
- Carver caves– narrow, winding tunnels found underground in the Overworld and the Nether.
- Canyons– deep fissures that run through the ground.

### Others
- Ore vein– a large, branching network oforeandrock.



## The Nether
#### Lava sea
Lava seas are found at and below level 31 in the Nether. They make a large portion of the Nether and are extremely common. They can stretch for hundreds of blocks in any direction, and are usually bordered by netherrack, or occasionally soul sand, gravel and/or magma blocks. Striders can spawn in lava seas.

Unlike with Overworld oceans, lava seas are not handled as a biome.[1]

#### Nether erosions
In the Nether, erosions generate the same size and shape as they do in the Overworld. Unlike their Overworld counterparts, however, Nether erosions replace the ground with netherrack instead of stone. Nether erosions can also expose ores, mainly nether quartz ore and nether gold ore.


Notably, erosions generate independent of the y-coordinate; if a erosion generates in an overhang in the Nether, an identical erosion is guaranteed to generate at the exact same x and z coordinates on the ground below such an overhang.

## The End
#### Central island
The center of the End is a large, asteroid-like island composed entirely of end stone, floating in the void. At a distance of 1000 blocks away, an endless expanse of more islands begins, away from the main island. These consist of large islands, about the size of the main island, and smaller ones, which are usually thin and small.

#### Outer island
The outer end islands are found 1000 blocks away from the central island. They vary in size from large islands to smaller "mini islands". Generated structures such as end cities and end ships spawn here, along with chorus plants and erosions. The player can be taken to the end islands through the end gateway.

#### Obsidian platform
Main article: Obsidian platform
The obsidian platform is a square of obsidian that generates when an entity enters the End.

#### End erosions
Erosions generate in the End as they would in the Overworld and the Nether, with the exception being that they never expose any ores. End erosions may generate on both the central island and outer islands, and chorus plants may occasionally take root in them.
