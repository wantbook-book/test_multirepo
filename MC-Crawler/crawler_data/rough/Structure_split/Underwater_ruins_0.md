# Ocean Ruins
Ocean ruins are structures primarily composed of stone bricks or sandstone found in ocean biomes and rarely on beaches. They contain chests, suspicious sand, and suspicious gravel; which hold a variety of loot, remarkably the buried treasure map and the sniffer egg. These ruins have cold and warm underwater variants that vary from large villages to single ruined huts.

## Generation
Cold ocean ruins generate in normal, cold and frozen ocean biomes or in their deep variants. They are composed of stone materials and contain some suspicious gravel blocks that can be excavated using a brush.

Warm ocean ruins generate in warm, lukewarm and deep lukewarm ocean biomes, and are composed of sandstone and stone materials as well as having some blocks of suspicious sand within them.

Ocean ruins may at times be at least partially buried, including with their airspaces. During generation, all air blocks and structure blocks act as structure voids. This means that their associated suspicious blocks will also be located under layers of usual sand, gravel and even stone.

Although most ocean ruins generate underwater, they sometimes generate on land, bordering a beach or another seaside biome.

30% of ocean ruins generate as large ocean ruins; the other 70% generate as small ruins. If the ocean ruin is large, there is a 90% chance for 4-8 (inclusive) small ocean ruins to generate around it in a cluster. If the ocean ruin is warm, large ocean ruins generate with a structure integrity of 0.9 and small ocean ruins generate with a structure integrity of 0.8. If the ocean ruin is cold, the "brick" variant of the chosen structure type generates with a structure integrity of 0.9 if large and 0.8 if small. The "cracked" variant generates with a structure integrity of 0.7 and the "mossy" variant generates with a structure integrity of 0.5, both regardless of size. Reduced structure integrity may also remove drowned from the structures.

## Structure
Main article: Ocean Ruins/Structure
The shape and size of ocean ruins varies greatly and they often generate together in groups to create ruined villages.

All but two of the structures contain a loot chest with loot inside. The chest contains loot for specifically either a small or large sized ocean ruin structure and may be buried by some sort of material such as gravel and sand.

Cold ocean ruins are primarily composed of stone bricks, gravel and suspicious gravel, and also contain prismarine, sand, magma blocks, sea lanterns, polished granite, glazed terracotta, bricks, planks, cobblestone, mossy cobblestone, stone brick stairs, obsidian or a chest with loot in it. Warm ocean ruins are primarily composed of sand, sandstone and suspicious sand, and also contain polished granite, polished diorite, sea lanterns, magma blocks, gravel, terracotta, sandstone stairs or a loot chest.

Many of the structures spawn with drowned (usually one or two, though a few structures have three or four).

Natural ocean ruins generate following the rules above and may not exactly match the stored structures.

The structures below are located in the folder client.jar/data/minecraft/structures/underwater_ruin. The following is a complete table of the structures with their filenames, descriptions and what they consist of.

Each structure block indicates either a chest with random loot or the spawn location of a drowned mob.

Please update this page to reflect recent updates or newly available information.Reason: Suspicious gravel and suspicious sand now generate in ocean ruins.
