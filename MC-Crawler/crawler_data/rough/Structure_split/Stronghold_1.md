### Libraries
A library inside a stronghold.
Libraries occur in two sizes: small single-level libraries and larger duplex libraries. All libraries contain bookshelves, oak planks, and one (single level) or two (duplex) chests, with cobwebs dispersed randomly.

Small libraries usually generate when the second level of the library is blocked by another part of the stronghold. If there are no obstructions, then large libraries usually generate.

Large libraries contain a second level consisting of a surrounding balcony with oak fences as railings, and fences & torches arranged like a chandelier over the center of the room. The two levels are connected by a ladder on the wall furthest from the entrance. No cobwebs generate on the second level.

Libraries are the most well-lit rooms in the stronghold, having enough torches to prevent mob spawning entirely within them.
