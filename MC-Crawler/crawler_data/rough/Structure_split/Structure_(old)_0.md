## Number and Frequency of Structures
The number of buildings composing a village can vary, and not every village is composed of all buildings at once. Apart from the well, which is unique and systematic, the number of buildings of each type is randomly generated, and increased in superflat worlds as there isn't too many obstacles in the way. Structures are picked from a weighted probability list (libraries are more common than butcher shops). There may be fewer buildings of a given type than the maximum allowed. The number of lamp posts has no restriction, as they are generated where no other buildings can be placed, such as smaller spaces. Roads are found between the buildings of the village and often extend beyond them for around 10 blocks without any buildings connected to them.

## Village structures
The descriptions below apply to plains villages. In other village types, some of the blocks are changed, for example desert villages use sandstone in place of wood and cobblestone in most structures.

"Tables" are made of brown carpets‌[Bedrock Edition  only] instead of wooden pressure plates.‌[Java Edition  only]

Village buildings and farms never generate "floating", instead filling in a foundation down to ground level when necessary. Buildings generate a cobblestone foundation, while farms generate dirt.

| Wood Hut       | $Wood Huts are made of oakand oak, with a rounded roof, a dirt floor, andfor windows.\frac{2}{3}$have a fencepost and pressure plate (brown carpet‌[Bedrock Edition  only]) 'table'. They generate one villager of a random profession inside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                        |
| Small House    | Small Houses are similar in size to wood huts, but made with more planks, fewer wood blocks, and acobblestonefloor. Their roof is flat, and 50% havefencedoff balcony with access provided byladders. As with wood huts, they generate with one villager. Unlike most other buildings, small houses have no door and so do not count as homes for villagers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                        |
| Large House    | Large Houses are composed of the same materials as small houses. However, they are much larger in size and are L-shaped. Two villagers generate in these houses. The house is not lit well enough to prevent hostile mob spawning. Achest‌[Bedrock Edition  only]is generated inside the building, if the village generates in thesnowy tundra/snowy taigabiome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                        |
| Butcher's Shop | Butcher's Shops have small seating areas made of two woodenstairsand between them a pressure-plate (carpet ‌[Bedrock Edition  only])-on-fence table. Nearby is a doublestone slabcounter. A fenced off backyard is located behind the building and is accessed through a door. One butcher villager and one villager with a random profession generate in the shop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                        |
| Library        | Libraries are longer and narrower than other buildings, and have a row of wooden stairs as a bench in front of two pressure plate-on-fence tables, with a row ofbookshelvesabove. They also have larger windows than any other kind of buildings. Acrafting tableis located in the corner. One librarian villager generates in each library.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                        |
| Farm           | Farms can come in small and large varieties. The small farms contain two 2×7 plots of crops with a row of water separating them, while the large farms are essentially two adjacent small farms. Each plot is planted entirely with one crop: 50% arewheat, 20% arecarrots, 20% arepotatoes, and 10% arebeetroot. When generated, the crops are at a random stage of growth. The farms are bordered by wooden logs, and in large farms, a walkway of logs also runs down the middle. Farms always generate with the line of water perpendicular to the adjacent road. Farms do not generate any villagers. If the village generates in thesnowy tundra/snowy taigabiome, farms won't include any crops. If used on a Superflat World with "Decorations" enabled, Sand, Gravel, and Clay have a rare chance to spawn in or under the farm, this only seems to work with Superflat Worlds however.                       | The two possible farms that can generate in a village. |
| Well           | Wells are 2×2 pools filled with water, surrounded by cobblestone and have small roofs of cobblestone supported by fences. The wells are normally 10 blocks deep, but are only 4 blocks deep inClassic Flatworlds due to the low elevation. There is only one well in each village.Grass path(which is not substituted with other blocks in different biomes, other than in deserts where sandstone replaces the grass path) circles the well. When the village is generated, the well is placed first, roads are generated outwards from it, and other structures are generated along the roads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                        |
| Blacksmith     | "Blacksmith" redirects here.  For the villager profession, see Villager.Blacksmiths are primarily made out of cobblestone (which is not substituted with other blocks in different biomes), with wooden walls on the far side (away from the lava) and stone slabs lining the roof. Blacksmiths do not have a door, making it not count as a house for villagers. If a door is added, villagers gather on the porch rather than going inside the building. On the front of the building is a small porch with an awning supported by fences. Three cobblestone stairs lead up to the porch from the road. On the porch is a small pool of lava, surrounded on one side by iron bars. There are also two furnaces and a work table made of one double stone slab. An opening leads to a back room with a small room and a small chest containing a variety of items. One blacksmith villager generates in the building. |                                                        |
| Church         | Churches are buildings made purely of cobblestone (which is not substituted with other blocks in different biomes) and cobblestone stairs, with a small 3 floor tower equipped with ladders and glass panes to a balcony on the top. One priest villager generates in the church.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                        |
| Lamp Post      | Lamp Posts can be found throughout villages, made of stacked fences topped with blackwool, to which fourtorchesare affixed, one on each side.
