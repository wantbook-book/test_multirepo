### 
Main article: Old Customized
"Customized" was a world type that gave control over many settings that affected terrain generation, such as ores, sea level, biomes, structures, and many variables that govern the random shape of the terrain. It was introduced in snapshot 14w17a for 1.8, and was removed in snapshot 18w06a for 1.13. Although customized worlds were added back in the 1.16 snapshot 20w21a, there is currently no in-game menu to modify worlds; custom worlds can be generated only by importing a JSON file.

These features never had any functionality in-game.

### Other
#### 
An unclickable "Play Tutorial Level" button was added to the main menu during Indev. With the addition of texture packs in Alpha v1.2.2, the button was removed. No tutorial level had actually existed during that time.

##### Fluff.png
In Infdev, a texture called Fluff.png was added. It was used as a texture for clouds from Infdev 20100611 to Infdev 20100618, but became unused in Infdev 20100624 and was removed by Alpha v1.2.2.

##### chunkinfo command
From 1.8 (snapshot 14w30a) to 1.13 (snapshot 17w45a), the file en_us.lang contained translation strings for a /chunkinfo command, which never existed in game. The following keys existed:

commands.chunkinfo.usage=/chunkinfo [<x> <y> <z>]
commands.chunkinfo.location=Chunk location: (%s, %s, %s)
commands.chunkinfo.noChunk=No chunk found at chunk position %s, %s, %s
commands.chunkinfo.notEmpty=Chunk is not empty.
commands.chunkinfo.empty=Chunk is empty.
commands.chunkinfo.notCompiled=Chunk is not compiled.
commands.chunkinfo.compiled=Chunk is compiled.
commands.chunkinfo.hasNoRenderableLayers=Chunk has no renderable layers.
commands.chunkinfo.hasLayers=Chunk has layers: %s
commands.chunkinfo.isEmpty=Chunk has empty layers: %s
commands.chunkinfo.vertices=%s layer's buffer contains %s vertices
commands.chunkinfo.data=First 64 vertices are: %s

It is unknown if this command was used for development or was simply a dropped feature.

### command_blocks.pdn
command_blocks.pdn
command_blocks.pdn was an unused file added in 15w34a. This file was created with the paint.net program and, presumably, was used in the creation of the textures for the impulse, chain and repeat types of command block, added in the same snapshot.

The file also contains multiple layers. From 10 layers, by default, only "Back Shadow", "Back Panel", and "Orange Back" layers are visible, forming the back texture for the impulse command block. The "Background" name is given to the first created layer in an image created by paint.net. This layer contains the old texture for command block, which implies that all other layers were created based upon it. Compared to the final textures, the layers included in command_blocks.pdn lack animation frames and use different colors for the individual “lights” on each “panel”.

| Layer | Layer name        | Blend Mode | Visible |
|-------|-------------------|------------|---------|
|       | Arrow Shadow      | Multiply   | No      |
|       | Arrow Panel       | Normal     | No      |
|       | Front Shadow      | Multiply   | No      |
|       | Front Panel       | Normal     | No      |
|       | Back Shadow       | Multiply   | Yes     |
|       | Back Panel        | Normal     | Yes     |
|       | Green Background  | Normal     | No      |
|       | Purple Background | Normal     | No      |
|       | Orange Back       | Normal     | Yes     |
|       | Background        | Normal     | No      |

command_blocks.pdn was removed in 15w34b.

### Spawning nether portals with F4
In Java Edition Alpha v1.2.2a, players had the ability to spawn nether portals by pressing F4. In Alpha v1.2.2b, spawning nether portals using F4 was removed.

### Time control with F6 and F7
In Beta 1.8 Pre-release, as a result of remaining debug code, players had the ability to use F6 and F7 to control in-game time. In Beta 1.8 Pre-release 2, the functionality of F6 and F7 was removed.

### Toggle rain with F5
In early Indev versions, pressing F5 would toggle between rain and clear.

### 
The "Player Activity" button in "Minecraft Realms" was added in 1.5, but it was removed in 1.14.4 for unknown reasons. This button was used to show the online activities of players.

### Texture pack
Texture packs were added in Alpha v1.2.2, and were replaced with resource packs in snapshot 13w24a for 1.6.1.

See also: Options

"3D Anaglyph" is an option in video settings that applies a red-cyan stereoscopic effect, enabling the use of red-cyan 3D glasses to experience the game in more depth. This option was removed in snapshot 17w43a for 1.13 due to 3D glasses becoming less popular.[citation needed]


### Void fog and particles
Main articles: Void and Fog
From Java Edition Beta 1.8 Pre-release up to its removal in Java Edition 14w34c, a fog effect and particles would appear in the lower 16 blocks of the world.
