# Old Customized
Customized (retroactively labelled Old Customized in 20w21a) was a world type that replaced the normal terrain of the Overworld with custom generation. It was removed in 18w06a with the rewrite of world generation. It was replaced with the Buffet world type in 18w16a, with all configuration removed other than biome and terrain shaping type. Custom worlds returned in a new format in 20w21a.

### Basic settings
There were 18 customization options that affected whether structures generate, among other environmental factors.

If the level is set below the default, land masses are bigger, and rivers may be shallow or dry. All land below level 63 is gravel. For low settings, the ocean may be reduced to small lakes, may be restricted to underground caves and caverns, or sometimes even doesn't exist. If the level is set above the default, low-lying biomes such as swamps are fragmented or nonexistent, creating a world with smaller land masses. Rivers are not "rivers" in the literal sense, but are more like subsurface valleys. The world may, at high levels, consist of sparse islands separated by deep water or may be all ocean, as in the Water World preset. Setting it to a negative value causes chunks never to load, always displaying "Waiting for chunk..." in the F3 menu.

This is not the actual number of dungeons per chunk - as not all attempts are successful. This is because they generate only next to an opening. This means that at a setting of 100%, few or no dungeons generate when the ground does not provide an opening for connecting to the right places. For example, in a world with only ravines, two dungeons generated at a setting of 100%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Water lakes can generate where there is no opening, unlike dungeons. Therefore, the underground water lakes are usually discovered by chance while digging. The decrease in the frequency is not linear: the difference between 1% and 25% is huge, the other differences up to 100% are minor. The lakes are - in contrast to the dungeons - not always at the same position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Increasing the number by one doubles the size of biomes. The generation of oceans and lakes are independent of biome size. Biomes are magnified from the origin (0,0). Even in a single-biome world, this makes a difference; in a desert world, higher "biome size" seems to predispose toward flatter terrain and more villages and temples, while a lower setting results in steeper, more rugged terrain with fewer villages and temples. See alsoLarge Biomes. Note that hill biomes and mutated biomes still generate in single biome worlds, respective of the base biome used to generate, and their locations change depending on biome size. While the slider is hard coded between sizes 1 through 8. Editing the JSON allows biome sizes from 0 and up to generate. Biome size 0 is 1/16th the default world's size 4. At sizes 20-23, much of the world is just a single biome for a million blocks or so, at size 31, it would extend over 2 billion blocks if the hard coded wall at 30 million is removed, so setting the biome size above 31 usually makes no difference, even at extremely large distances. |

Decreasing the number by one doubles the proximity of rivers to each other. So while slightly larger rivers result from changing this 2 points, approximately 3 times as many rivers generate. At a setting of 1, rivers generate through most of the landscape; at 5, there are large tracts of land with no water. Rivers are magnified from the origin (0,0) so increasing the value by 1 doubles the distance to a river. If the sea level is reduced far below 63, many "rivers" generate dry although their beds aredirtregardless of the surrounding biome. While the slider is hard coded between sizes 1 through 5. Editing the JSON allows biome sizes from 0 and up to generate. River size 0 is 1/16th the default world's size 4, meaning nearly the entire world is covered in rivers. At sizes 20-23, over 1 million blocks separate rivers, at size 31, rivers could be effectively removed or impossible to find, even if the hard coded wall at 30 million is removed, so setting the river size any higher than 31 is usually ineffective, even at extremely large distances.                |
