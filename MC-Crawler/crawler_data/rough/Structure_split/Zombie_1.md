### Husks
Main article: Husk
Husks have an 80% chance to spawn in desert biomes in place of zombies. They attack like regular zombies, but inflict hunger for several seconds and do not burn in sunlight.

### Drowned
Main article: Drowned
Drowned mobs spawn in ocean ruins, rivers, most parts of oceans or when a normal zombie drowns. They are able to swim and breathe underwater as well as walk on land. Most drowned use melee attacks, but some spawn with tridents and throw them when attacking instead.

Zombies that are wearing armor and go underwater continue wearing the armor when converted to a drowned, although tools and weapons are lost.‌[JE  only]

Zombies that convert to drowned drop all worn or held equipment with full durability and preserving existing enchantments.‌[BE  only]

### Geared zombies
Some zombies spawn wearing armor or holding tools, both of which may be enchanted. In addition, zombies may also spawn with the ability to pick up loot that is on the ground. The chances of each of these events occurring are listed below. Zombie villagers can also spawn naturally with armor, weapons or tools. If a zombie spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (i.e. all pieces are made of the same material). Zombies cannot naturally spawn with netherite armor.

If a zombie does spawn with armor, the chances of specific armor are as follows:

Java Edition:

| Armor                           | Easy & Normal | Hard  |
|---------------------------------|---------------|-------|
| Boots                           | 100%          | 100%  |
| Boots and leggings              | 75%           | 90%   |
| Boots, leggings, and chestplate | 56.25%        | 81%   |
| Full set                        | 42.19%        | 72.9% |

Bedrock Edition:

| Armor                            | Easy & Normal | Hard  |
|----------------------------------|---------------|-------|
| Helmet                           | 100%          | 100%  |
| Helmet and chestplate            | 75%           | 90%   |
| Helmet, chestplate, and leggings | 56.25%        | 81%   |
| Full set                         | 42.19%        | 72.9% |

The chances of it being of a particular material are:

| Armor Type | Chance |
|------------|--------|
| Leather    | 37.06% |
| Gold       | 48.73% |
| Chain      | 12.90% |
| Iron       | 1.27%  |
| Diamond    | 0.04%  |

Armor worn by zombies is not damaged from most damage sources, which means it cannot "wear out" the way player armor does. Helmets (not blocks like pumpkins) on zombies can eventually wear away and break if the zombie is exposed to daylight or has an anvil or other falling block dropped on its head. Zombies also have a natural armor rating of 2 (), giving 1.6 to 8% damage reduction from most sources. Zombies can also wear mob heads, although they need to be dropped by the player before the zombie can pick one up and put it on.

On Halloween, zombies in Java Edition may spawn wearing a carved pumpkin or jack o'lantern. They are never dropped, even when the zombies are killed with Looting.

1. ↑ a b cDropped only when kill credit is given to the player
2. ↑Dropped as baked potato if on fire when killed.

#### Taken equipment
Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping and drops without changing the damage that has accumulated on it.

#### Naturally-spawned equipment
Zombies have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment and drop it with a random durability. Each level of Looting increases the chance by 1 percentage point (11.5% with Looting III). These items include:

- Iron Shovel(sometimesenchanted)
- Iron Sword(sometimesenchanted)
- Random Armor(sometimesenchanted, made from leather, gold, chainmail, iron or diamond)

#### Experience
Any zombie that spawns with equipment gives 1–3 extra experience points per item when killed. Adult zombies drop 5 and baby zombies drop 12 when they are killed by a player or a tamed wolf.
