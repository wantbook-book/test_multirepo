### Gathering
Late in the day, adult villagers gather at a meeting place (the area around a bell). When two villagers encounter one another, they mingle (look at each other and "converse" by humming at other villagers). They may also share food, or breed if both are willing.

If a villager isn't close enough to detect a bell, it wanders randomly, searching for one.

### Playing
5 villager children chasing one another.
Baby villagers wander randomly around the village. When they encounter another baby villager, the two of them follow each other for a while and sometimes run as if racing or chasing each other. 

In Java Edition, they sometimes stop to jump and bounce on a bed or to stare at an iron golem they encounter. If the iron golem offers them a poppy, the baby villager cautiously accepts it.

### Returning home
All villagers head home a short time before sunset. They roam around until they get near their beds, then target a block beside the bed. Once they reach their beds, they do not go through a door again before sleeping.

A villager who has no bed simply waits inside a house until morning. This includes players stealing a villager's bed to sleep in, mostly the villager stays in the house and doesn't move until sunrise. But sometimes, if they detect a unclaimed bed nearby they walk out of the house and toward the bed.

A villager pushed on a bed in Java Edition. The villager falls off the bed if it is pushed again.
Dropping an anvil on a villager that is sleeping in Java Edition does not hurt the villager nor causes the villager to wake up.
### Sleeping
A villager sleeping in a bed at night (from the top view).
At sunset, villagers lie down in their beds and remain there until morning. Villagers wake early if food is thrown at them ‌[Java Edition  only], they are pushed out of bed, or if their bed is destroyed. They also wake up when their bed is used, if they are attacked, or when a bell is rung.
If possible, they return to sleeping in a bed after the interruption.

Jumping on a bed with a villager sleeping in it doesn't cause the villager to get up. 

In Java Edition, a villager can be pushed on its bed and sometimes turn its head. A villager can be pushed off a bed,[9] but is most likely to go back to sleeping after staring at the player who pushed the villager for a few seconds. 

When sleeping in Bedrock Edition, a villager's hitbox reduces to a cube restricted to the pillow part of the bed. If an anvil is dropped on the hitbox, the villager takes damage and wakes up. 

In Java Edition, dropping any anvil on a villager that is sleeping causes the anvil to bounce and drop as an item, and the villager remains sleeping and does not take damage. 

A villager who has no bed continues wandering in search of a bed to claim.

Villagers follow their Overworld schedules regardless of which dimension they are in. They can sleep in the Nether or the End, without causing the usual consequences of the bed exploding (See Bed § Sleeping), if the Overworld's time is correct.[10] This is because the daylight cycle continues in these dimensions, even though it is not normally apparent to the player.

Sometimes when a villager gets in a bed from another direction they turn their body until their head is on the pillow of the bed. Villagers also sleep with their eyes open, just like players.

### Healing
A villager gets a brief regeneration effect once leveling up in its profession. Pink regeneration particles appear while it is healing.

In Bedrock Edition, when a villager successfully sleeps, it immediately heals itself when waking up at dawn (if it is damaged).

## Professions
Job site blocks next to each other.
All plains biome variant professions (except unemployed) corresponding to their different job site blocks.
Each villager can have a profession except for the nitwit, indicated by their clothing as well as by the title at the top of the trading interface. A villager can choose their profession by claiming a job site block. When they go to work, they use their daily schedule to get to their claimed job site block. Some professions, like farmers and librarians, do other things. Farmers plant crops, and librarians can inspect bookshelves. If an adult villager does not have a profession (either they are unemployed or a nitwit), they wander instead.

A job site block can be claimed only if it is unclaimed and within a village boundary with at least 1 bed. Removal of a claimed job site block causes the owner to switch to another profession or become unemployed, provided that the villager has no prior trades with the player. If the villager has prior trades, it keeps its profession and claims a new job site block that matches its profession if one is available. So, once a player trades with a villager, the villager keeps its profession forever.

Nitwits and baby villagers cannot change their profession.

In Java Edition, villagers summoned by a spawn egg or via command /summon are always unemployed until they have claimed a job site block. In Bedrock Edition, however, villagers summoned in similar ways have a random profession[11]; their profession can be changed by a job site block, though.

Novice-level villagers who have not yet traded can lose their profession and change into unemployed villagers.

Unemployed adults actively seek for an unclaimed job site block and change into the corresponding profession.

Below is a table listing the various professions, along with the specific job site block that each profession requires:
