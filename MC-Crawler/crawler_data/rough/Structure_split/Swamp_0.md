# Swamp
The swamp is a wetland biome where slimes, frogs, and bogged‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0] can spawn.

## Description
Swamps have sparse oak trees which can grow on land or in shallow water and generate with vines growing on trees. Mushrooms are more common here than most of overworld biomes. Sugar cane is found often growing on shores. In Java Edition, seagrass litters the bottom of flooded areas. Blue orchids grow among the grass, which are found exclusively in swamps. Lily pads are scattered across the surface of the water and dead bushes dot the surface of the land. In Bedrock Edition, huge mushrooms can generate as well.

Swamp biomes, alongside mangrove swamps‌[JE  only] and deserts, can generate rare underground fossils.

A swamp may include a swamp hut, housing a witch and a black cat. Only witches can spawn in and around the hut.

Swamps have elevations low enough to go below sea level throughout much of the area. A large portion of swamps are flooded, where patches of clay are found on the lakebed. The shores of swamps may have marsh-like terrain, where the shores are very irregular, often without smooth transition, and with some small puddles generated. Water in swamps takes on a gray-green color.

Underwater fog is thick here so that visibility is also lower than other biomes when the player is underwater. Additionally, unlike other Overworld biomes, swamps have varying tints for grass blocks, grass, and leaves, etc. See Biome#Special plant tints.

The swamp biome generates at temperatures of -0.45 to 0.2, meaning it generates at the temperate and cold biome temperature noise values. Swamps generate next to most plains, sunflower plains, flower forests, most forests, birch forests, dark forests, most taigas, old growth taigas, and some windswept savannas. Swamp biomes are usually found in flat terrain near sea level in regions with very high erosion values, and they also replace rivers in these areas. Swamps never directly border the ocean, with some other biomes generating between them instead. However, their water bodies are often connected to the ocean.

Slimes may spawn in swamps during the night, exclusively between Y=50 and Y=70, making swamps and mangrove swamps the only places where slimes can be found aboveground. Their spawn rate is affected by the moon phase, spawning most often during full moon and not spawning at all during new moon. Bogged add an additional threat to the night, as their poison arrows can increase the danger of hostile mobs. ‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0]

Villagers that spawn in swamps get a unique swamp-themed look. While villagers have swamp-specific types, no village featuring exclusively these villagers can be generated. The only way for these villagers to spawn is either by being bred in a swamp or curing a zombie villager that spawned in a swamp.

The following mobs naturally spawn here：
