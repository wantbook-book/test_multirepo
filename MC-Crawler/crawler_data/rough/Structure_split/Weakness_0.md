## Effect
Melee damage inflicted by the affected entity is reduced by 4 × level in Java Edition. Negative levels increase melee damage dealt.

In Bedrock Edition, melee damage under the Weakness effect can be found through the equation BaseDamage×0.8level+0.8level−10.4 where BaseDamage is the default attack damage with whatever weapon or tool is used to attack.[note 1][note 2]

Attacks with a damage of 0 or lower would be ignored entirely, however in Bedrock Edition, the use of enchantments such as Sharpness still allow damage to be dealt.

This effect is also used to cure zombie villagers, preceding the golden apple.

The effect can be removed by drinking milk. In  Minecraft Education and Bedrock Edition when education options are enabled, drinking elixir also removes weakness.

2. ↑To find the damage when Strength and Weakness are applied at the same time, first calculate the damage with the Strength formula, then plug that in as the "BaseDamage" in this Weakness formula.
