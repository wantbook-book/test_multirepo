#### Wetland biomes
Wetland biomes contains rivers, swamps and beaches. They have a large amount of water resources. Rivers separate other biomes; beaches generate as a transition between the ocean and land.

| River          | A biome that consists of water blocks that form an elongated, curving shape similar to a real river. Unlike real rivers, however, they have no current. Rivers cut through terrain or separate the main biomes. They attempt to join up with ocean biomes, but sometimes loop around to the same area of ocean. Rarely, they can have no connection to an ocean, instead of forming a loop. The grass has a dull aqua tone, much like the ocean, and trace amounts of oak trees tend to generate there as well. Rivers are also a reliable source of clay. These biomes are good for fishing, but drowned can spawn at night. In Bedrock Edition, mobs other than salmon, squid and drowned cannot spawn in this biome, even underground, except in a monster spawner.                                                                                                                                        | River                         |
| Frozen River   | A river with a layer of ice covering its surface. It generates when a river goes through snowy biomes. Salmon spawn underwater while rabbits and polar bears spawn on ice. At night, drowned can spawn below the ice with strays on the surface. In Bedrock Edition, no other hostile mobs can spawn here, even underground, except from a monster spawner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Frozen river                  |
| Swamp          | A biome characterized by a mix of flat areas around sea level and shallow pools of green water with floating lily pads. Clay, sand and dirt are commonly found at the bottom of these pools. Trees are covered with vines and can be found growing out from the water. Mushrooms and sugar canes are abundant, and blue orchids grow exclusively here. Frogs of the temperate variant can spawn here as well. Swamp huts with a black cat and a witch generate exclusively in swamps. Slimes also spawn naturally at night, most commonly on full moons. Some zombies may end up underwater, which can transform them into drowned, making this an especially dangerous biome at night. Temperature varies within the biome, causing foliage and grass colors to vary. In Bedrock Edition, huge mushrooms also spawn in this biome. Visibility is also lower than other biomes when the player is underwater. | SwampSwamp in Bedrock Edition |
| Mangrove Swamp | A biome characterized by a dense foliage, featuring plenty of mangrove trees which vary a lot in height. The floor is mainly composed of mud blocks with occasional grass patches. The grass has the same color as in the normal swamp but leaves and vines have a unique light green tint and the water is teal rather than gray. Frogs often spawn in this biome and all frogs spawned here are warm frogs. Slimes also spawn naturally at night, most commonly on full moons. Some zombies may end up underwater, which can transform them into drowned, making this an especially dangerous biome at night. Visibility is also lower than other biomes when the player is underwater.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Mangrove swamp                |
| Beach          | Generated where oceans meet other biomes, beaches are primarily composed of sand. Beaches penetrate the landscape, removing the original blocks and placing in sand blocks. These are also useful for fishing. Buried treasure can be found under few blocks of sand. Passive mobs other than turtles do not spawn on beaches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Beach                         |
| Snowy Beach    | Like a regular beach, one can find plenty of sand in this biome and buried treasure can be found underground in this snowy beach. However, sand is covered in a layer of snow. Snowy beaches are found when a snowy biome borders a frozen ocean biome. No passive mobs other than rabbits‌[BE  only] spawn in this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Snowy beach                   |
| Stony Shore    | True to its name, this stone-covered biome often appears where mountains meet the ocean. Depending on the height of the nearby land, stony shores may generate as medium slopes or huge cliffs, its tops tall enough to be covered by snow even when near warmer biomes.[1] No passive mobs spawn here. Buried treasure can generate here‌[BE  only]. Strips of gravel can sometimes be found here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Stony shore                   |

#### Flatland biomes
These biomes have a flat terrain and a wide view. Trees spawn less here and water sources are plentiful. They also have a higher number of passive mob spawns.

These biomes are further divided into two categories: plains and snowy plains.

| Plains           | A flat and grassy biome with rolling hills and few oak trees. Villages are common. Cave openings, lava lakes and waterfalls are easily identifiable due to the flat unobstructed terrain. Farm mobs are easily found in plains biomes; this biome and its variants are also of the few biomes where horses spawn naturally. Pillager outposts may also be generated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Plains           |
| Sunflower Plains | A fairly uncommon variation of the plains, this biome is the only place where sunflowers naturally generate, hence the name. They grow in abundance, making yellow dye a widely available resource. In Bedrock Edition, villages may also generate here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Sunflower plains |
| Snowy Plains     | An expansive biome with a huge amount of snow layers. Sugar cane can generate in this biome, but can become uprooted when chunks load as the water sources freeze to ice. There are few spruce trees in this biome. No animal mobs other than rabbits and polar bears are able to spawn, however, it is one of the few biomes where strays appear. In Bedrock Edition, this biome doesn't spawn monsters other than strays and skeletons, but monster spawners can still spawn monsters. Due to the biome's size and scarcity of wood and animals, initial survival becomes difficult in comparison to other biomes. This is one of the three biomes where igloos naturally generate. Villages and pillager outposts may also generate here. | Snowy plains     |
| Ice Spikes       | A rare variation of the snowy plains biome that features large spikes and glaciers of packed ice. Usually, the spikes are 10 to 20 blocks tall, but some long, thin spikes can reach over 50 blocks in height. The floor in this biome is entirely covered in snow blocks instead of grass, and ice patches made of packed ice can generate on it. Like the regular snowy plains, no animal mobs other than rabbits and polar bears are able to spawn and strays appear at night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Ice spikes       |
