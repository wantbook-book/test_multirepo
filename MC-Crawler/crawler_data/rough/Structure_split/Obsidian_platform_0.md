## Generation
The obsidian platform always generates at coordinates (100, 48, 0), mostly far away from the island, making it tough to get there. Players who enter the End spawn at coordinates (100, 49, 0), facing west toward the main island; other entities that enter the End spawn at coordinates (100.5, 50, 0.5), in the middle of and 1 block higher than the platform. Sometimes the platform generates inside a case of end stone; enough end stone is replaced with air in this case so that the player can walk around, with 3 blocks high of breathing space. Occasionally the platform may generate in midair, forcing the player to bridge or throw an ender pearl toward the main island.

If the platform is destroyed, or if a block is placed on top of it, the platform is restored and any overlaying blocks on or within 3 blocks above the obsidian are replaced with air when an entity enters the End.

The obsidian platform generates only when an entity uses an end portal, not when teleporting with /execute in minecraft:the_end. End gateways on the outer End islands also teleport entities to the obsidian platform, but do not cause the platform to regenerate.
