## Description
### Generation
The deep dark is a cave biome that generates deep underground beneath areas with a low erosion value. Usually, the deep dark is mostly within the deepslate layer, but it can still reach the stone layer.

The biomes the deep dark generates under are the ones with the least erosion and high altitudes. These are:

- Most often:jagged peaks,stony peaks,frozen peaks,snowy slopes, andgroves
- Often (plateaus):cherry groves,meadows, andsavanna plateaus
- Less often: underbadlands,wooded badlands, anderoded badlands
- Never:oceans,riversorswamps.

### Composition
This biome is often covered in large patches of sculk blocks surrounded by sculk veins, which include sculk-related blocks such as sculk shriekers, sculk sensors and sculk catalysts.

### Thematics
The biome is dimly lit; there is almost no glow lichen, with the only natural light sources being sculk catalysts and lava. No mobs spawn in this biome (but monster rooms can still spawn mobs[1].) However, the warden may appear if enough sculk shriekers are triggered, giving the player the Darkness effect.

### Structures
This is the only biome where ancient cities can generate. Other structures and features that can be found in the deep dark include monster rooms, strongholds and amethyst geodes. Mineshafts never generate in a deep dark biome, although they may extend into one.

### Mining
The deep dark can be a great place for mining diamonds since they are most frequent at the deepest layers of the world. The sculk floors and walls can easily be destroyed with a hoe, yielding a large amount of experience. This is even easier if the hoe has Mending.

While certain ores that are exposed to air blocks have a chance to not generate, sculk blocks are considered a solid block during generation, causing many ores to be revealed under it. Other mobs don't spawn, so the warden is the only threat, which can be safely avoided by destroying all nearby shriekers.
