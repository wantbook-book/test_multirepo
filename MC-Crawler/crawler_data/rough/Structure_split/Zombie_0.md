## Spawning
### Natural generation
Zombies may spawn in the Overworld in groups of four, above solid blocks in a light level of 0, except in mushroom fields and deep dark biomes. All zombie variants (including babies) require a 2-block tall space to spawn.

All zombies spawned in desert biomes and exposed to the sky have a likelihood of 80%‌[JE  only]/70%‌[BE  only] to be replaced by husks. Zombies that are not husks or drowned have a 5% chance to spawn as zombie villagers. Zombie variants have a 5% chance to spawn as babies. The baby zombies also have a chance of spawning as a chicken jockey in Java Edition.

When a zombie spawn egg is used on a zombie, it spawns a baby zombie.

### Sieges

  

This feature is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


Main article: Zombie siege
If a player is near a village at midnight, up to 20 zombies may be spawned in the village in accordance with mob spawning rules. The spawning can even happen in mushroom fields biome if the triggering player is in an adjacent biome. Zombies spawned as a part of a siege are always regular zombies; zombie villagers, husks and drowned never spawn as a part of a siege, even in their respective biomes.

### Monster spawners
Inside monster rooms, zombies may have a chance to spawn from a monster spawner. Zombies spawned from a monster spawner are never zombie villagers in Java Edition, although zombie monster spawners in Bedrock Edition are able to produce them. Zombies spawn from monster spawners inside 50% of monster rooms.

### Trial spawners
‌In Java Edition 1.21 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.0‌[upcoming], adult zombies have a chance to be selected as the "melee" mob for trial spawners in trial chambers; baby zombies have a chance to be selected as the "small melee" mob for trial spawners.

### Husks
When a husk's head is submerged in water for over 30 seconds, the husk starts transforming into a zombie, with a new entity UUID. The husk's equipment remains on the zombie after conversion.‌[JE  only] The zombie transforms into a drowned if its head remains submerged.

## Variants
### Baby zombies
For the mob in Minecraft Dungeons, see Minecraft Dungeons:Baby Zombie.

#### Behavior
Baby zombies make up 5% of zombie spawns. They behave similarly to regular zombies, with the following differences:

- They are much faster than normal zombies, yet they have the samehealth.
- The noises they make are higher-pitched than adult zombiesoundeffects.
- Babyzombie villagersturn into baby villagers if cured.
- Wornarmorshrinks to fit their body size.
- They are able to fit through 1×1blockgaps.
- They give 12experiencepoints when killed by the player or a tamed wolf instead of 5.
- Unlike most other baby mobs, they remain babies indefinitely and never become adult zombies.
- They have a decreased hitbox size.

In Bedrock Edition, 15% of naturally spawned baby zombies can start riding a mob and become a jockey when it tries attacking. The jockey mobs ridden by the baby zombie adapt the speed of its rider. In Bedrock Edition, a baby zombie can ride:

- Adultchickens
- Untamedocelots
- Untamedcats
- Untamedwolves
- Adult zombies
- Adulthusks
- Adultzombie villagers
- Adultzombified piglins
- Cows
- Adult unsaddledpigs
- Sheep
- Untamed adulthorses
- Untamed adultdonkeys
- Untamed adultmules
- Adultskeleton horses
- Adultzombie horses
- Mooshrooms
- Spidersthat were not spawned as a jockey mount
- Cave spidersthat were not spawned as a jockey mount
- Pandas

Zombies and their variants spawn with random values of knockback resistance between 0% and 5%.

### Zombie villagers
Main article: Zombie Villager
Zombie villagers have a 5% chance of spawning in place of zombies and may also spawn from a villager killed by a zombie. The chance of a villager turning into a zombie villager when killed by a zombie or zombie variant depends on the difficulty level.

When a group in the normal spawn cycle spawns zombies, there is a 5% chance to instead spawn a group of zombie villagers‌[Bedrock Edition  only], or a single zombie villager.‌[Java Edition  only]

If any type of zombie kills a villager, there is a chance for the villager to transform into a zombie villager.

| Difficulty | Chance |
|------------|--------|
| Easy       | 0%     |
| Normal     | 50%    |
| Hard       | 100%   |

Any villagers that get killed by a zombie have a chance to turn into a zombie villager with armor on normal or hard difficulties.

Zombie villagers can be cured (converted to normal villagers) by first giving them the Weakness effect, which can be applied by:

- Asplash potionofWeaknessthrown by theplayer, adispenser, or awitch.
- An area effect cloud of Weakness from alingering potion.
- An area effect cloud of Weakness from acreeperexplosion.‌‌[Java Edition  only]
- Atipped arrowthat was dipped into a Weakness potion.

The weakened zombie villager must then be healed by using a (non-enchanted) golden apple on them.
