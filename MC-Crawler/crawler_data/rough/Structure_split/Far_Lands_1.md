### Types of Far Lands
The Far Lands comprise a very, very wide array of terrain generation bugs. The effects vary depending on which noise generator breaks (for traditional Far Lands, "low noise" and "high noise" are jointly responsible), as well as the player's distance on each axis (the "Edge Far Lands" refer to when noise breaks on only one axis, the "Corner Far Lands" on two, and the "Vertex Far Lands" on three).

Other noise generators are capable of breaking down. Selector noise, a noise generator which determines whether low noise or high noise is used at a given position in the world, breaks down 80 times further than low and high noise by default, giving rise to what is known as the "Farther Lands".

A full list of Java Edition noise generators known to break down and give rise to their own unique effects is as follows. Note that it assumes that the X and Z axes are identical, and ignores the Y axis; in many cases, the Y axis has a different value from the X and Z axes, whereas in other cases the noise generator is entirely 2D.

### Walking to the Far Lands
Walking to the Far Lands is the time-consuming challenge involving a terrestrial journey 12.5M blocks out of spawn. The most common version used is b1.7.3 as this is the last version to contain the Far Lands and has the conveniences such as beds that some previous versions don't have.

Over 30 players have attempted the feat legitimately, with about 1/3 completing the journey, 1/3 currently walking (as of October 2023) and 1/3 having gone inactive (including one death, TinfoilChef). The first player to complete the journey (without using the Nether as a means of shortcut) was KilloCrazyMan between 2019-20. Notch awarded him $6,000 through two separate donations. The most famous is the ongoing Far Lands or Bust with KurtJMac, through which he donated over $460,000 to charity in over 10 years.[2]

Time-wise, the walking (not sprinting) speed is 4.3 blocks per second. Walking for 6 hours per day is equal to 21,600 seconds, giving a travelled distance of 92,880 blocks every day. Walking to the 12.5M Far Lands would take just under 136 days at this pace.

Furthermore, one person, Xelanater, has reached the Nether Far Lands legitimately.[2]
