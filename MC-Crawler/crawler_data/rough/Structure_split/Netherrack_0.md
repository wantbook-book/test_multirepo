## Obtaining
### Breaking
Netherrack can only be obtained with a pickaxe. It drops nothing if mined without one.

1. ↑Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

Netherrack can also be obtained by mining nylium with a pickaxe that's not enchanted with Silk Touch.

### Natural generation
Netherrack makes up most of the Nether's terrain, and also generates as part of ruined portals in the Overworld.

Netherrack generates as part of bridge and treasure room bastion remnants.


### Post-generation
In Bedrock Edition, netherrack generates as part of nether portals spawned floating. This makes netherrack renewable.

Crimson or warped nylium transforms into netherrack if a solid, opaque block is directly above it, or when it is covered by snow.[1]

## Usage
Netherrack is mostly used as a cheap building block. Because of its abundance and softness, it is often used to construct temporary structures that can be used for scaffolding, blockage, or other purposes.

When netherrack's top is lit on fire, the fire burns indefinitely. Unlike soul fire, this fire can spread.

Using bone meal on netherrack placed next to warped nylium or crimson nylium transforms the netherrack into more warped or crimson nylium.

Analyzing the netherrack in a material reducer, it turns out to be a volcanic silicate rock rich in mercury.‌[Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education  only]
