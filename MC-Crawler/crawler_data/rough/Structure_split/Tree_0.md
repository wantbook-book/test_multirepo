## Structure
The trees found in Minecraft, excluding the jungle bush, azalea trees, mangroves, and cherry trees.
Trees vary widely in height, from a bare minimum of 1 log block for jungle bushes, ranging up to a maximum of 30 blocks for mega jungle trees.

Tree canopies are composed of leaf blocks and grow 1 block higher than the highest log block (except those of the fancy oak, whose leaves grow 3 blocks higher). The canopy may begin from the ground and go up to 6 blocks from the ground. Tree canopies are generated from roughly spherical clusters of leaves about 5–7 blocks across, centered on sections of trunk or branches. Leaves must be supported by an adjacent trunk (or leaf blocks connected to the trunk); otherwise, they disappear.

Fancy oak, dark oak, and mega jungle trees grow branches (logs connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to the trunk or other branches). Most of the time, a single tree has between one and six branches, and each branch has between one and six logs. Acacia tree branches do not cover their branches in this way.[more information needed] Regular oak, jungle, birch, spruce, pine, mega spruce, and mega pine lack branches.

## Growth and characteristics

This jungle tree cannot grow because of the red wool block (looking from the northwestern corner).
Trees are created when chunks are generated, and can also be grown from saplings.

Tree saplings have a 1⁄20 chance (1⁄40 if they are jungle saplings) of dropping from leaf blocks when they decay or are destroyed. There are seven species of saplings, corresponding to seven trees: oak, birch, spruce, jungle, acacia, dark oak and cherry.

A tree that was grown in a cave, with the necessary light provided by torches.
The sapling can be planted on any variant of dirt, (except dirt path) a moss block, or mud, and must have a light level of at least 8 in the sapling block. 

A sapling uproots with light level 7 or less in the sapling block itself unless it has a view of the sky that is unobstructed (except by glass or other transparent materials). The sapling must have at least 6 blocks of space above it to grow; the amount of required space varies between the different species of trees. A ceiling above sapling limits the maximum height of the tree that can grow from that sapling. However, dirt blocks and logs may not prohibit tree growth, and in some cases may be replaced as a sapling attempts to grow through them. However in Bedrock Edition, logs prohibit tree growth.

If multiple saplings are planted next to each other, each one grows as long as the leaves from the other grown saplings do not block too much of the sunlight. Artificial light (torches, etc.) can still be used to grow them if this happens.

Trees can be generated anywhere where there is light and dirt.
All trees in the active chunk radius around the player make attempts to grow at random intervals. For any given tree this can work out to about one growth attempt per minute. When a tree attempts to grow, it first checks that it has enough light, then randomly chooses which variant of that species of tree to become; for example, an oak sapling chooses to grow as either a normal or fancy oak tree.

Once a tree has passed a light check and chosen size to attempt, it checks if there is enough space for its chosen size. If it encounters an obstruction during this check, it fails to grow and must wait for the next pass before it can attempt to grow again. This means that a tree in an open field with enough light grows relatively quickly, but a tree in a cramped tree farm that stunts its size may make several attempts before finally growing.

Bone meal, when used on a sapling, has a chance of forcing it to grow, so long as all of the normal checks (light, space, dirt, etc.) have passed. It does not guarantee growth, but forces an attempt to grow.

Planting trees in the Nether
All saplings grow normally in the Nether and in the End, although they must be planted in dirt transported from the Overworld and provided with sufficient light and space. Leaf blocks in the Nether have the same color as if they were placed in a desert biome. In the end, they are a dull bluish-green, as in the windswept hills biome.

In order to grow a 2×2 tree (be it spruce, jungle or dark oak), four saplings must be placed adjacent to each other in a square. For growth to succeed, there must be no blocks adjacent (even diagonally) to the north-western side up to the final height of the tree. The bone meal can be used on any of the saplings. The largest mega jungle trees, mega spruces, and mega pines reach 31 blocks tall. Dark oaks are typically 6–8 blocks tall.

Leaves and logs removed from a tree do not grow back over time.

When a sapling on a grass block or mycelium grows into a tree, the grass block or mycelium is instantly converted to dirt.
