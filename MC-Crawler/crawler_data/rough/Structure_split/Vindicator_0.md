## Spawning
On Normal difficulty and Hard difficulty, vindicators sometimes spawn with a randomly enchanted iron axe: the chance is 0–25%, and is higher when the regional difficulty is higher.

### Woodland mansions
Vindicators spawn during the generation of woodland mansions, in groups of 1–3 inside particular rooms, sometimes accompanied by an evoker. Rarely, vindicators can spawn in the corridors and hallways. 

They do not respawn after initially spawning. Vindicators generated in mansions do not naturally despawn unless the world is switched to peaceful difficulty.

Vindicators are sometimes neutral if naturally spawned in a woodland mansion, which means that the vindicator does not attack the player on sight, but only after the player attacks it.

### Patrols
Main article: Patrol
In Java Edition, any vindicators can join a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain, but do not go seeking out for patrols to join.

### Raids
Main article: Raid
Vindicators can spawn during raids. They appear more frequently during later waves and at higher difficulties.

Vindicators that spawn from raids have a chance to spawn with Sharpness I on their axe, or Sharpness II in waves 6 and up. This replaces the usual chance of a random enchantment.

Vindicators can spawn riding ravagers, creating a vindicator ravager jockey.‌[JE  only]

### Java Edition
In Java Edition, if a player spawns a vindicator with a spawn egg or using a command, the vindicator has a chance of becoming an illager captain, with a Ominous banner attached above its back.
