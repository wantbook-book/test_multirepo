### Bedrock Edition

  

It has been suggested that  this section be split into its own page  at Stripe Lands. [discuss]
If this split may potentially be controversial, do not split until a consensus has been reached. Reason: Bedrock Edition does not have a world boundary, and this page says that. (UTC 18:41, 4 March 2024)


#### Horizontal limits
Bedrock Edition technically has no hard boundary, and the world at far distances is far too ravaged by several distance effects to provide any semblance of reasonable gameplay. Nonetheless, there do exist intentional defined limits for some game functionality:

- It is impossible to teleport beyond X/Z ±30,000,000 using commands in the vanilla game. Any attempts to teleport further puts the player back to this coordinate. Attempting to use any block placement command results in an error message. Despite this, it is still possible to usestructure blocksand the/locatecommand.
- X/Z ±31,999,872 are the maximum coordinates reachable in the Overworld viaNether portal. The only way to teleport beyond these coordinates is to use external tools (such as a world editor).

#### Vertical limits
The player is able to go to Y ±30,000,000 but it is impossible to teleport beyond these coordinates without the use of external tools.

### Walking to the Boundary
Legitimate terrestrial journeys to the various World Boundaries has been done across different versions of Minecraft. The 30M Java Border has been reached by Figonometry in 1.17. The Java Boundary on b1.7.3 has been reached by MysticalMidget, who reached the Far Lands before continuing the journey to 32M. One other player, DumbName, has attempted to reach the Bedrock Boundary but ceased at 2.1M due to "Lots Of Storage Problems Plus The Jitter Point At 2,097,152 Blocks"[1]

For players who reached the 12.5M Far Lands, see the Far Lands page. 

Time-wise, the walking (not sprinting) speed is 4.3 blocks per second. Walking for 6 hours per day is equal to 21,600 seconds, giving a travelled distance of 92,880 blocks every day. Walking to the 12.5M Far Lands would take just under 136 days at this pace. The Boundary is almost 3x further out.

## Effects
### Java Edition
Main article: Java Edition distance effects
Generally, long server response times caused by massive distances produce unintended results, but most blocks and entities behave normally, with a few exceptions:

- Pistons may sometimes not extend or retract until they receive another block update.
- Beyond the X/Z ±30,000,000 mark:
	- Mobsdo not spawn at all.
	- Lightingdoes not update (with exception to sunlight and moonlight).
	- Itemsmay jitter slightly.

Beyond this, most of the unintended behavior of blocks and entities is caused by either the world border (as detailed here) or being sufficiently far from the world origin (see this page). Some odd effects that are attributed to the boundary itself are as follows:

- Attempting to walk into the boundary still displays a walking animation, walking sounds, and cause view bobbing, effects that are not present for walking into the world border or solid walls.[2]
- Usingelytrato fly into the border causes the flying sound to continue to play at full volume rather than quietly or not at all.[3]
- Rainparticles always hit the ground at exactly sea level regardless of the actual shape of terrain beyond 30 million blocks.[4]
