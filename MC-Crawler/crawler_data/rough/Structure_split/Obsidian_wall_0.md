## Generation
Obsidian walls would replace all solid blocks which had an X or Z coordinate of 0, and extend two blocks above the terrain. This formed a set of two walls for the two cardinal directions and would intersect at the center of the world. The obsidian walls would generate in every world.

## Structure
In Infdev 20100227-1, the player would spawn at the point which the two walls intersect. The wall was always made of 2 block high obsidian which was placed on top of the existing terrain. From there, it would generate obsidian going all the way down to the bottom of the world replacing any stone, dirt, or grass blocks below it.
