## Types of trees
See also: Tree/Structure

There are nine types of trees – oak, spruce, birch, jungle tree, acacia, dark oak, azalea tree, mangrove, and cherry.

Other structures are loosely defined as trees: the huge fungus, huge mushroom, and chorus plant.

### Oak
Main article: Oak
Oaks are among the most common trees in the game. They have the smallest space requirements, and along with dark oak trees, they can drop an apple when a leaf block is destroyed. In swamp biomes, a slightly larger variant of the regular oak tree with vines is generated, which can naturally generate in shallow water. Fancy oaks may also grow or generate in place of regular oaks; these are taller and may feature branches. A rare variant is its smallest configuration, colloquially known as a "balloon" oak.

### Spruce
Main article: Spruce
Spruce trees grow from spruce saplings and have growth patterns and requirements similar to birch trees, although they appear different. They are mainly found in the taiga biome, but they may also generate in windswept forest, snowy plains, snowy taiga, and old growth taiga biomes. Spruce logs have the same texture as oak logs, but it is a darker shade of brown; its leaves are denser, with a darker and more bluish tone.

### Birch
Main article: Birch
Birch trees look fairly similar to small oaks in terms of height and are most commonly found in birch forest biomes. There are two types of birch: a shorter tree that can be grown by the player with birch saplings; and a taller, rarer variety that generates only naturally in tall birch forest biomes.

### Jungle
Main articles: Jungle tree and Jungle Bush
Jungle trees are one of the rarest naturally generated trees in Minecraft because they are native to the jungle biomes, which are themselves rare. Jungle tree leaves drop jungle tree saplings. When planted in grass or dirt they grow into a jungle tree with a 1×1 trunk, but the player can place them in a 2×2 formation to grow a jungle tree with a 2×2 trunk like the trees found naturally in the jungle biome. Jungle bushes also generate in the jungle biome, featuring a single jungle log surrounded by oak leaves‌[Java Edition  only] or jungle leaves‌[Bedrock Edition  only].

### Acacia
Main article: Acacia
Acacias are found in the savanna biome. They are about 8 blocks tall and feature unique diagonal trunks, and may occasionally have multiple canopies.

### Dark oak
Main article: Dark oak
Dark oaks are found in the dark forest biome. They have thick 2×2 trunks. A dark oak always generates with dirt blocks under its trunk, even on a steep cliff. Irregular logs, representing large branches, are nearly always present and connected to the trunk. The canopy of a dark oak filters enough light that a dense forest of them is sufficiently dark for hostile mobs to spawn during the daytime.

### Azalea
Main article: Azalea tree
Azalea trees generate on any empty space above a lush cave, with roots consisting of rooted dirt and hanging roots that reach down to the lush cave. The tree usually appears at the surface, but they can generate inside caves if there is enough room and a lush cave below.

Azalea trees can be manually grown by applying bone meal to an azalea or flowering azalea block ("bush"). Unlike most trees, they do not have their own wood type (the trunks are composed of oak logs), but they have two types of leaf block: azalea leaves, and flowering azalea leaves.

### Mangrove
Main article: Mangrove
Mangroves are found in muddy mangrove swamps, growing in water or on land. They are grown from propagules, which can be found hanging from the trees. A mangrove converts any mud around it to muddy mangrove roots. The wood has a deep red-orange color.

### Cherry
Main article: Cherry

Cherry trees are found in cherry groves. They have distinct pink leaves and curved branches. They also have a unique petal falling particle effect.

### Huge fungus
Main article: Huge fungus
Huge fungi come in many shapes and sizes, from really small to really huge. Their trunks are composed of "stem" blocks which are nearly identical to wooden logs, except for being non-flammable.  In place of leaves they have nether wart blocks or warped wart blocks, with occasional shroomlights embedded within them.  Crimson huge fungi often generate with weeping vines.  

Huge crimson fungi are found in the crimson forest biome; huge warped fungi are found in the warped forest biome.

They can be grown from crimson or warped fungus, placed on crimson nylium or warped nylium.  To grow into a huge fungus, the original fungus must be planted on the matching type of nylium, and then bone meal applied to it.
