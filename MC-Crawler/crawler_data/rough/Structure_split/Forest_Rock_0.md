## Generation
A forest rock is a feature that represents a boulder, made entirely of mossy cobblestone. They can be found dotted around areas of the old growth taiga biomes at the surface.

## Construction
Forest rocks represent fairly large rocks, varying in size and shape, and usually half-buried in the ground. Their shapes are overall similar, although some are smaller or larger depending on generation and whether they join with a nearby boulder. Each face tends to have a cross shape or square shape, possibly missing a corner or two.
