## Overworld
#### Hill
For the biome, see Windswept Hills.

Hills can contain extreme slopes, cliffs and caves. On an amplified world, hills are extremely common in all biomes except oceans.

- A Windswept Hills biome.
- A large overhang occasionally found in Windswept Hills biomes.
- A Windswept Hills overhang with a floating island.

#### Mountain
For the biome, see Mountains.

Mountains are high elevation terrain that has jagged peaks and higher land.

#### Cliff
Cliffs are steep vertical slopes that can sometimes generate beside an ocean or a big lake. 

- A frozen cliff.
- 
- 
- 
- A cliff generating shaped like a crater.

#### Fjord
Fjords happen when rivers cut through high-medium elevation terrain. Rivers are deeper here than usual.

- A badlands fjord.
- 
- 

#### Floating island
Floating islands are structures that float in mid-air. Floating islands are normally just small chunks of floating dirt and stone found near cliffs, but on rare occasions they can be large structures that even have springs and trees on them. Floating islands are most frequently found in windswept hills biomes and their variants, as well windswept savannas.

- A small floating island.
- It is rarer to see large floating islands, especially those with natural features such as trees.
- A cluster of large floating islands.
- A small but tall floating island with water flowing down from it.
- A floating island in a forest biome with a few trees growing on it.
- A tree on a snowy floating island.
- A large floating island with trees in the distance

#### Noise cave

### Surface
#### Surface layer
The uppermost layers of the terrain are converted to a biome-dependent material: usually grass blocks and dirt, or sand in deserts and beaches. Podzol is found in giant tree taiga, mycelium in mushroom field biomes, and red sand is found in the badlands biome. Sandstone is generated under the sand.

#### Erosion
Occasionally, instead of being converted to dirt or sand, the top layer is stripped away, leaving an 'erosion' (aka. 'basin') of bare stone. They occur more often in forests or plains and occasionally contain water. Commonly, minerals can be found in these, generally coal ore and iron ore. If generated in a Badlands biome, gold ore can also be seen.

- A naturally generated erosion.
- A desert erosion.
- A taiga erosion.
- A snow-covered tundra erosion.

#### Strip
Strips are long stretches of blocks in certain biomes that replace the typical surface materials in these biomes. They can occur in stony shore biomes as strips of gravel, in stony peaks biomes as strips of calcite, in frozen peaks biomes as strips of packed ice, as well as in grove and snowy slopes biomes as strips of powder snow.

- A strip of calcite in a stony peaks biome.
- A strip of gravel in a stony shore biome.

#### Hoodoo
Hoodoos are tall spike-like structures found in badlands, consisting of six colors of terracotta. While this structure is found exclusively in eroded badlands, all badlands biomes actually have this structure, but set to false except for eroded badlands and can occasionally pass altitude layer 100.

- Hoodoos in an eroded badlands biome.
- Hoodoos in a Mesa Bryce biome in an older version of Minecraft.
- Hoodoo render.
