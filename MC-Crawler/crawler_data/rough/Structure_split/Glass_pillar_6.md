#### Gravel roads
Main articles: Village § Paths and Village/Structures (old)
Before Java Edition 1.10, villages used gravel with cobblestone underneath to signify roads; however, in Java Edition 1.10, grass paths were added to signify village roads. However, grass paths sensibly were only generated where they replaced grass blocks, and gravel paths still existed until Java Edition 1.14, when the jigsaw system broke it.[4]

#### Savanna village
Prior to Java Edition 1.10, plains villages would generate in savanna biomes. Plains villages was replaced by savanna villages made out of acacia derived blocks.

#### Desert village
Prior to Java Edition 1.3.1, plains villages would generate in desert biomes. Plains villages was replaced by desert villages made out of sandstone derived blocks.

Prior to Java Edition 1.8, plains wells would generate in desert villages. Plains wells was replaced by desert wells made out of sandstone derived blocks.

Glass pillars were added in Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3. They were used to mark the location of strongholds, as the eye of ender did not lead to strongholds yet. One pillar extended from the main entrance and another from the portal room. They went all the way up to the build limit. This was because Jeb forgot to remove the debug pillars before releasing the version publicly. They were removed in Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4, due to eyes of ender being able to lead players to the stronghold portal room.

## Map settings
### Cloud customisation
The color and height of clouds could be changed in Indev, however this functionality was removed in Infdev. Unlike many other things now customizable in Java Edition via custom world generation, this is yet to see a return.

### Isometric screenshot
An isometric screenshot.
An isometric screenshot displaying the bug of not capturing chunks, which are not in the player's FOV.
In the Indev versions of Minecraft, players could take a screenshot of the map from an isometric perspective using F7. When the game captured an isometric image, it would save the current location of all mobs and show any and all alterations to the map the player had made that would be visible from the perspective of the sun (at sunrise). The player would not be visible unless the player was in third-person view before taking the isometric screenshot.

The isometric screenshot would save to their local user folder as "mc_map_####.png" where #### represents the number of the screenshot starting at 0000 up to 9999.

There are some limitations that existed with the screenshots:

- They could capture the player's sprite only when in third-person view.
- Due to a glitch, the screenshot would render only those blocks that are in the player's FOV, and everything else is either black or shows underground sections that would have been obstructed.


This feature was removed in Infdev due to the addition of infinite worlds.

A "Winter Mode" world.
A rare occurrence: reeds generated in a "Winter Mode" world.
"Winter Mode" was a randomly occurring map type in Alpha. It was added on July 9, 2010, in Alpha v1.0.4 and was the first "biome" to appear in Minecraft.

There were a couple of differences compared to normal worlds. First, there was the presence of snowflakes, which fell constantly. There were four different kinds of snowflakes. These snowflakes would create snow on surfaces directly exposed to the sky, provided that it was a solid block. Due to a lack of unfrozen water, reeds were rare. The second element unique to "Winter Mode" was the presence of ice. When a map was generated, most exposed water blocks would be frozen into ice. The water did not freeze completely near gravel beaches. The third element was a decrease in the spawning rate of passive mobs.

Whether a world was in "Winter Mode" was determined with a 25% chance at creation.

"Winter Mode" was removed in Alpha v1.2.0 with the addition of proper biomes.

### Biomes prior to 1.7.2
Main article: Biome
Versions prior to 1.7.2 had two biomes that were later removed from the world generator. Despite being unused, they continued to exist until Java Edition 1.18, in which mountain edge got removed.

The following biomes became unused in 1.7.2:

- Mountain Edge (now available in the "Buffet" world type)
- Frozen Ocean (restored in 1.13 as a very different biome)

### Biomes prior to Beta 1.8
Main article: Biome/Before Beta 1.8
In Beta 1.8, biomes received a major overhaul, removing and changing many of them. Prior to these changes, there were 13 biome types that were much smaller and less distinct.
