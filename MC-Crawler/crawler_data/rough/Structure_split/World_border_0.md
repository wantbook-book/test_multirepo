## General information
The world border from the outside using the /tp command.
The world border appears as a series of animated, diagonal, narrow stripes at 29,999,984 blocks out of the center of the world.

The world border is tinted depending on how and if its size is changing. By default, when the border is not changing, the stripes are a translucent aqua color. If the border is expanding, the stripes appear green; if the border is shrinking, they appear red.

The world border appears different depending on the current graphics setting, which is likely not intended;[1] on Fast and Fancy it appears as light and translucent, but on Fabulous! it appears considerably darker.

### Size
The world border is essentially a giant bounding box; by default, its center lies at coordinates above Y=255.

With commands, the size and position of the border can be modified. The world border always behaves in full block increments, even if it is set to a partial block. Its size and location remain the same across all dimensions.

### Walking to the border
A terrestrial journey to the border through legitimate means, without using a Nether shortcut, has been done by a single player, Figonometry between 2021â€“22, as of October 2023.[2]

Others have completed the journey through means such as glitches, elytra flying on the Nether roof, or otherwise.

Time-wise, the walking (not sprinting) speed is 4.3 blocks per second. Walking for 6 hours per day is equal to 21,600 seconds, giving a travelled distance of 92,880 blocks every day. Walking to the Far Lands, 12.5 million blocks away, would take just under 136 days at this pace. The border is almost three times further out.

## Effects
### On entities
Most entities, with exception to some projectiles, are unable to move through the world border.

If a dispenser or dropper is placed so that it directly faces the edge of the border, then items, projectiles, TNT, etc. can be fired outside of the edge of the border. Any items fired out of a dispenser float in midair; if an item is dropped from the player inventory, the item falls normally.

If a mob is spawned from a dispenser via a spawn egg, the mob behaves normally. Spiders can climb the world border, and endermen can teleport outside of it and Pillagers can walk through it.

Any players on the outside of the world border (with exception to those in Creative or Spectator mode) take constant damage as long as they are outside the border. The amount of damage depends on the distance to the border, with damage being inflicted when the player is outside an area that is 5 blocks wider than the world border on each side. Players typically cannot interact with blocks or entities outside the world border.

Additionally, while sneaking if they are less than one block outside the world border, some of the effects that occur while sneaking or changed or removed. These are:

- Being prevented from walking off edges
- Having movement slowed
- Decreased eye level andthird-person view, character model bending over slightly
- Shorter hitbox
- Fainter name tag inmultiplayer[verify]
- Moving throughscaffolding: the player instead falls through it as if it were air

If the player was already sneaking before entering this area, their eye level and third-person view remains decreased.

While players themselves cannot move through the world border, even if they manage to go ahead of chunk loading, they can reach the other side of the world border through other means, including: 

- Letting the world border pass them as it is shrinking
- Throwing an ender pearl through the world border
- Consumingchorus fruitnear the world border and being teleported beyond it
- Dying and respawning, if the spawn point is outside the world border

Oddly, while standing inside the world border while close to it and looking at it at a negative angle, trying to use item (such as throwing projectiles, eating food, or shooting a bow) results in nothing happening.

Entities cannot spawn naturally outside the world border. They persist without taking damage if they spawned before the world border gets shrunk by a command.
