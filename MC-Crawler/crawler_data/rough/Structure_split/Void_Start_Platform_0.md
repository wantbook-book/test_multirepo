## Generation
The void start platform spawns from block positions (-8, -61, -8) to (24, -61, 24), and thus the player spawns at Y=-60. This feature is most easily accessible through "The Void" preset but it still generates if different layers are specified, even if it gets engulfed.  Void start platforms replace any blocks such as even Bedrock when generated underground.

## Construction
