# Overworld
The Overworld is the dimension in which all players begin their Minecraft world. It is the dimension with the most biomes, blocks, and mobs, and is where most players spend the majority of their time.

## Creation
Main article: World generation
The Overworld is the only dimension created when the player creates a new world. The other dimensions (The Nether and The End) aren't created until a player enters the corresponding dimension for the first time.

### Seeds
Main article: Seed (world generation)
A new world in Minecraft is generated through the use of a randomly generated seed, which is an integer used as a starting point for the world generation formula. The player can specify a seed or allow the game to generate one randomly. If given a non-integer input (such as the word "Glacier"), the game converts it into a corresponding integer (such as 1772835215). 

A given seed generates almost exactly the same world every time, provided the same edition, game version, and world type are used. Although the exact spawn point varies, the coordinates of all terrain features are the same. All seeds within the 32-bit integer limit in Java and Bedrock editions may also generate worlds with the same terrain shape and biome map, but the placement of terrain features, structures, and carver caves may differ.

## Environment
The Overworld is an incredibly complex environment with a wide variety of features.

### Biomes
A river biome running through a badlands biome. A ruined portal can also be seen in the distance.
Main article: Biome
The Overworld is divided into biomes of various types. A biome's type determines the basic characteristics of the terrain within it, such as the blocks composing the surface or the plants that thrive in it. The biome type also determines which mobs can spawn within it and affects how environmental behaviors such as weather are expressed within it.

### Natural structures
A village, one of many naturally generated structures in the Overworld.
Main article: Generated structures
The Overworld is composed of a large number of terrain patterns, called generated structures, whose arrangement varies widely from one seed to another. The exact structures are unique to each world, while the types of structures that can be generated at a given place are determined by the biome type. Structures are meant to represent real-world equivalents such as mountains, caves, and lakes. "Impossible" (in the real world) formations, such as floating islands, can also be found throughout the Overworld.

Along with terrain features, natural structures include naturally-generated buildings, such as villages, dungeons, mineshafts, and ruined portals.

### Daylight cycle
A view of the day-night cycle.
Main article: Daylight cycle
The Overworld is the only dimension with a daylight cycle and the only one where the environment reflects the passage of time. In contrast to time zones in the real world, Overworld time is universal; it is always the same time for every player in the dimension regardless of how far apart they might be, even in an "infinite" world.

During the daytime, the sun acts as a powerful light source, with a light level of 15, the maximum. Sunlight is strong enough to grow plants and affect the way mobs spawn, among other interesting effects. During the nighttime, the moon is the only natural light source. However, moonlight is comparatively dim; the light level falls to a minimum of 4, allowing hostile mobs to spawn. Other than during thunderstorms, nighttime is the only time players may sleep in a bed.

The daylight cycle can effectively be measured using a clock, which allows players to determine the approximate Minecraft time anywhere in the Overworld. Time can also be changed or stopped with the use of the /time command.

The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, just as it does in the real world. Observing its motion is a simple method of telling direction without a compass.

### Mobs
Main article: Mob
The Overworld is home to a wide variety of mobs. Mobs vary greatly in behavior and the level of danger they present to the player. Different mobs spawn at different times and places depending on the light level and the biome, among other factors. On occasion, a mob can move between the Overworld and another dimension, such as The Nether, by using a portal, but this is uncommon. Boss mobs like the ender dragon and the wither cannot enter portals.
