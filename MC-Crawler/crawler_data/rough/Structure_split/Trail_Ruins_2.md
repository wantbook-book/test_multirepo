## Loot
The loot in trail ruins can be found by brushing suspicious gravel randomly generated throughout the structure. There are two types of suspicious gravel, common and rare. Their loot tables are listed below.

Each structure piece (see the file structure list above for piece names) contains gravel and uses one of three processor lists to replace some of the gravel with other blocks, including suspicious gravel. All of the tower_top structure pieces and everything in the roads folder replaces two gravel with two common suspicious gravel. The rest replace nine gravel with six common suspicious gravel and three rare suspicious gravel. Additionally, all of the processor lists (except for the one used for the tower_top) first replace 20% of the gravel with dirt, then 10% of the remaining gravel with coarse dirt, followed by common suspicious gravel, and finally rare suspicious gravel (if applicable). This means a structure piece can generate less suspicious gravel than it should. This mainly affects the decor structure pieces as they contain less gravel, but is extremely unlikely with larger structure pieces.

### Common
In Java Edition, each trail ruin's suspicious gravel contains 1 item stack,  with the following distribution:
