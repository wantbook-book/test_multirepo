## Generation
A bamboo is a feature that represents a bamboo plant, made of bamboo blocks. They can be found in the Jungle, Sparse Jungle‌‌[Bedrock Edition  only] and Bamboo Jungle biomes at the surface. They're less common in Jungle and Sparse Jungle‌‌[BE  only] biomes.

In Jungle and Sparse Jungle‌‌[BE  only], there's no podzol under the bamboo, while in Bamboo Jungle, podzol sometimes generates.

Bamboos' height varies between 5 and 16 blocks, and if there's an obstacle preventing growth, it may be even shorter.
