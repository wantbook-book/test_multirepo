### Taming
Main article: Taming
A sitting tamed black cat.
Stray cats can be tamed using raw cod or raw salmon (see Behavior for how to approach a cat). Once tamed, cats follow the player who tamed them. They do not despawn, no longer fear the player and purr or meow frequently. Like wolves, and with the same limits, they can teleport to a player who moves 12 blocks away.

The player can order a cat to sit/stand by pressing use on it. If the player is holding a raw cod or salmon when commanding a cat to sit or stand, the fish is given to the cat instead, causing it to enter love mode. Once in love mode, the player can command a cat to sit or stand while holding a fish. Cats also sit on certain things of their own accord (see ยง Tamed cat).

### Breeding
Main article: Breeding
Two cats with a newly bred kitten.
When tamed cats are fed a raw cod or salmon, they enter love mode. Breeding creates a kitten, and the parents cannot breed again for 5 minutes. The kitten has the coloring of and belongs to the owner of one of the parents. 

Two sitting cats are unable to breed, but a mobile cat can breed with a sitting cat, in which case the mobile cat's owner also owns the kitten.
The 20 minute growth of kittens can be reduced using raw cod or salmon. Each fish reduces the growth time remaining by 10%.

When breeding 2 cats of separate owners on a multiplayer server, the user who joined first automatically gets the kitten.[verify]

### Healing
An injured tamed cat restores 2 health when fed an uncooked cod or salmon by its owner. Unlike tamed wolves, a tamed cat's tail is not an indicator of its health.
