# Buried Treasure
Buried treasure is a naturally generated structure that consists of a buried loot chest. The chest is buried primarily in beaches, and rarely in the ocean floor. Buried treasure is the only source of the heart of the sea, which can be used to craft a conduit. Buried treasure can be located using explorer maps.

## Generation
Buried treasures generate in beach biomes, and can also generate underwater.

The treasure chest is almost always buried by some material. Most of the time the chest generates buried in a beach, so it has a sand or gravel block covering it. Sometimes, if generated on the side of an underwater hill, it spawns with stone blocks covering it. If it generates on the surface of the ocean floor, a gravel or sand block covers it. Nonetheless, terrain generation can cause the chest to be buried by any suitable terrain-generated blocks, such as coal ore and diorite.

In Java Edition, buried treasure always generates at chunk coordinate 9 (out of 0 through 15) on both the X and Z axis,[1] and are always facing east.

In Bedrock Edition, buried treasure always generates at chunk coordinate 8 (out of 0 through 15) on the X and Z axis.

## Structure
Buried treasures contain a single chest full of various loot. If the chest is exposed to water, it generates waterlogged.

A heart of the sea is always present in every buried treasure.

In Java Edition, each buried treasure chest contains  items drawn from 6 pools,  with the following distribution:
