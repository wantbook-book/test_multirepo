#### Atriums
There are two types of atriums connecting the first corridor to the entrance chamber:

- corridor/atrium_1contains a grand staircase and a fountain in the center. On the far walls to either side is a mural depicting one of several different images.
- corridor/atrium_2contains a large wall with two opposite staircases.

Each type of atrium contains an ominous vault.

#### Hallways
Some hallways end at a dead end, which is hallway/rubble. This dead end has a reward chest at the end.

#### Intersections
There are two types of intersections, both connecting two corridors with a combat chamber and containing a room with four beds and a barrel with loot:

- intersection/intersection_1connects the corridors through the bottom floor and has a staircase up to the bedroom.
- intersection/intersection_2connects the corridors through the top floor and has an underwater bedroom accessible via a ladder.

Each type of intersection contains an ominous vault.

#### Chambers
There are a variety of combat chambers, each containing multiple trial spawners, vaults, and one ominous vault. Most chambers have several dispensers along the walls triggered by stone buttons.

- chamber/chamber_1is a tall room with a central pillar that can be reached by crossingcopper grateplatforms hanging onchainsor narrowcopper blockbridges. A gap in the pillar has a breeze trial spawner, and one or more corners may have an upper ledge with a ranged trial spawner and possibly a vault. Some obstacles may be placed at random on the bottom level.
- chamber/chamber_2is similar to the above room, but with the floor covered inpowder snowand some obstacles made oftuff bricks. The breeze trial spawner is replaced with a ranged trial spawner, and one of the corner ledges (if present) has a dispenser beneath it with no buttons or contents.
- chamber/chamber_4is a small room with wide bridges, three small melee trial spawners, and two vaults, but no dispensers. Copper grates under one of the bridges leave a 1-block high gap that the small mobs can easily pass through.
- chamber/assemblyis a large square room with a platform along one wall, which has a vault and two trial spawners (1 ranged and 1 breeze). The center of the chamber is filled with random structures and may include additional vaults, ranged trial spawners, and dispensers, as well as other obstacles.
- chamber/chamber_8is a tall, narrow room with five ranged trial spawners on three successively higher ledges. Under each ledge is a row of oxidizedcopper trapdoors. There are two vaults at the bottom and two more vaults on the highest ledge.
- chamber/eruptionis a large, round room withmagma blocksaround a central platform, at least three trial spawners(1 melee, 1 ranged, and 1 breeze), and at least one vault. Atop the central platform is a fountain-like structure with oak buttons and an upward-facing dispenser containing awater bucket. The room has two levels, with melee trial spawners and various obstacles being on the lower level. On the upper level, ranged trial spawners can be found sitting on ledges in the various corners of the room. A small room housing a vault is also found on the upper level. These and any additional vaults, trial spawners, and obstacles may be placed around the room at random.
- chamber/pedestalis a two-story room with a large, tall pedestal in the center topped by four trial spawners (1 breeze and 3 random others). Additional melee trial spawners are on the upper floor, and a large number of vaults are scattered throughout the chamber, but there are no dispensers. Several passageways are blocked by walls of copper grates.
- chamber/slantedis a two-story room with ledges of varying heights on the upper floor, some of which have 1-block high tunnels of copper grates hidden underneath. The upper floor also has a breeze trial spawner in the center and several melee trial spawners, and a large number of vaults are scattered throughout the chamber, but there are no dispensers.

### Trial spawners


Main article: Trial Spawner
When a trial chamber structure generates, one mob from each category is randomly selected for the trial spawners in that structure. Every mob within the same category has an equal chance to be selected. The breeze is in its own category and is thus guaranteed to be found in certain combat chambers of every structure. Every type of room generates the same trial spawner category in the same location, with the exceptions of the corridors and the center of the pedestal combat chamber.

Each trial spawner is centered above a 3ร3 square of blocks in the floor that indicates which mob it can spawn.

### Vault generation
Vaults generate throughout the trial chambers. One vault can be found on the highest platform of the entrance room, and many more vaults can be found in the various combat chambers in the structure.
