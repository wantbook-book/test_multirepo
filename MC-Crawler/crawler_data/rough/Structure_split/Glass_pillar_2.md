## High-distance anomalies
Many of the game's mechanics would break down in strange ways when at a large distance from the origin of the world. The vast majority of these effects have been patched, or at least minimised, in modern versions.

### Hard limits
Main article: Java Edition hard limits
For elements of the game which are integer-aligned, such as the positions of blocks, Java Edition uses integer data types, which can be either 32-bit or 64-bit. 32-bit integers were more commonly used in older versions, which allowed for 4,294,967,296 possible distinct integer values, ranging from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Exceeding these boundaries, such as by using an external editor to move the player to beyond 2,147,483,647 blocks from the origin as to force the game to load blocks beyond this position, often would result in major game-breaking bugs and crashes.

Accessing such regions is now much more difficult than it was previously, as distance is now much more restrictive, requiring modifications to the game to allow these limits to be exposed.

### Floating point imprecision
For elements of the game which are not integer-aligned, such as the positions of entities, Java Edition uses 64-bit floating point (or "double") values for arithmetic and storage of relevant variables. However, there are odd cases in which a 32-bit floating point value is used instead. Such cases are rare in the modern game (a full list of those which still exist in 1.20 can be found at Java Edition distance effects), however older versions of the game used 32-bit values (or unnecessarily casted from and to them, resulting in data loss which could have easily been avoided without this pointless casting) much more heavily, resulting in a plethora of strange gameplay bugs which were tied to how far the player was from the center of the world, getting twice as intense for every integer power of 2 blocks the player went from the center.

The rendering precision loss bug, one of the more famous float bugs.
One of the most notable floating point precision loss bugs is where the rendering of the world stops being accurate depending on the player's position. Commonly experienced alongside (and frequently, and incorrectly, blamed on) the Far Lands, the position at which blocks render will not match up with that of entities and other world elements such as the hitboxes of blocks. At 8,388,608 blocks and beyond, the game will assume the player is standing at the edge or corner of each block, and will always render the blocks of the world as if they player is standing at one of those corners. This effect is difficult to describe in text, and is best experienced firsthand.

Most of the other issues regarding floating point imprecision deal with the creation of particles, spawning of entities, and (prior to their standardisation in 1.8 with json files, which fixed all of these permanently) the geometrical distortion of block models.

A comprehensive list of since-fixed issues, as well as breakdowns of how they progress, can be found at Java Edition distance effects/Historical effects.

### Boundary effects
Main article: World boundary
Boundary effects refer to oddities which arise due to hardcoded numerical limits in the game, such as the 30 million wall (as opposed to hard limits, which are defined by the programming language and/or computer architecture rather than the game code).

The current world boundary as of 1.20 is a "pseudo-wall" which exists at 30 million blocks from the origin, a chunk beyond the world border. (This is defined as a "pseudo-wall" rather than a true wall as rather than being solid and preventing passage like the world border or a solid block does, the player's position is instead set to 30 million by the game if the player attempts to exceed it, which can be seen by the fact that the walking animation, step sounds and view bobbing can still be experienced by walking into the wall, as does the sounds of flying with an elytra.)

However, previous versions had much stranger effects at great distances. The world boundary was something commonly experienced in Classic and Indev due to worlds being small by design. The first versions of Infdev, which did away with such boundaries, therefore had no such effects, instead exposing the existing hard limits of the game (although experiencing these was effectively impossible due to floating point bugs rendering the game unplayable much earlier).

The version of Infdev released on March 13, 2010 reimplemented a boundary at 32 million blocks, likely to prevent access to the then-relatively-new Far Lands which existed at a bit over 33 million blocks. This boundary was considerably different and buggier than those from Indev, although this was largely to be expected due to it being effectively impossible to reach legitimately. Beyond this 32 million limit, blocks would no longer exist at all, and give way to an empty void. When major changes to world generation brought the Far Lands much closer to the world origin later that same month, however, the world boundary still remained at 32 million, meaning the Far Lands were completely possible to reach without modding the game.

Looking back at the world from beyond the 32 million limit.
Updating blocks next to this void would cause the game to freeze due to it having to calculate an immense amount of lighting updates. This void could still be traversed by entities normally until the April 13 build, in which entities that render it would become stuck in place and jitter eternally. This was later fixed in an unknown version.

In Alpha v1.2.0, the boundary effects would get stranger than before. While previously no blocks would render beyond this point, Alpha v1.2.0 and onwards would cause a strange phenomenon in which chunks would appear to generate, but would be intangible, appear fully lit, and generated features such as trees and ores would not generate at all in these chunks.

The corner of the world in 1.0.0.
For reasons which remain completely unknown to this day, Beta 1.8 would shrink the world boundaries inwards from 32 million blocks out to only 30 million blocks out. While the effects would remain similar, with blocks beyond the 30 million boundary appearing fully lit and ignoring collision and feature generation, these fake chunks would only generate a small distance out from this boundary, stopping at 30,000,064, or four chunks from the boundary. In addition, any entity attempting to surpass 30,000,032 would again be stuck in a jittery stasis, with players in particular having their heads twist unnaturally if looking around after this point (a bug that was patched in 12w03a, where facing direction would no longer change and preventing this unnatural twisting).

With the client-server split in snapshot 12w18a for 1.3 (a change which broke many other things about the game), the stasis bug was actually fixed, and fake chunks could be generated beyond the 30,000,064 point, allowing for the player to keep flying outwards until 32,000,000 blocks, where they would be kicked out of the game due to being in an illegal position, revealing that not all elements of the 32,000,000 limit had been removed from the game yet. 12w27a, a later snapshot for 1.3, would clamp nether portal positions to be within the 30 million limit.

1.7 and 1.8 started to make major changes to the world boundary to bring it to its modern state. 1.7 first made all blocks beyond 30 million completely solid, including air. Said wall could still be surpassed, however, by flying over it, as it only extended to the 32-bit limit on the Y-axis, allowing for 32 million blocks to be reached once more and the illegal position game crash triggered. The boundary became more unstable from version to version throughout 1.8's development, with the end result on its release being that chunks beyond 30 million blocks would no longer render, and teleporting beyond 30 million would crash the game. 1.9 would allow chunks beyond 30 million blocks to render once more, and prevent teleportation beyond 30 million blocks at all. Little has changed about the world boundary between this point and 1.20.
