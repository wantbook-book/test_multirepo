### Config
Main article: Configured feature
Java Edition:

- config
	- ignore_vines(optional, defaults to false) Allows the tree to generate even if there are vines blocking it.
	- force_dirt(optional, defaults to false) If true, places the dirt provider even when the block below the tree is a valid dirt-like block.
	- dirt_providerThe block to place below the trunk. Places only ifforce_dirtis true, or if there is not a valid dirt-like block below the trunk.
		- 
		- Block state provider
	- trunk_providerThe block to use for the trunk. Note that when the trunk placer isfancy_trunk_placer, the block must haveaxisproperty, such as logs.
		- 
		- Block state provider
	- foliage_providerThe block to use for the foliage.
		- 
		- Block state provider
	- minimum_sizeDefines the width of the tree at different heights relative to the lowest trunk block, for the minimum size of the feature.
		- min_clipped_height(optional) Value between 0 and 80 (inclusive). If the possible height at this location is lower than trunk height, but greater or equal to this value, the tree generates anyway. If not specified, the tree won't generate as long as the possible height is lower than trunk height. If the possible height at this location is lower than this value, the tree cannot generate.
