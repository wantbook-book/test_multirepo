# Suspicious Gravel
Suspicious gravel is a fragile gravity-affected block found in various Overworld structures. They can be brushed to extract structure-dependent loot, and are the only source of pottery sherds alongside suspicious sand. Suspicious gravel drops nothing if broken, and break if they fall from any height or are moved with a piston.

## Obtaining
### Breaking
Suspicious gravel is unobtainable by mining, even using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch. They are much softer than normal gravel, and can be instantly broken with merely an unenchanted diamond shovel. They are affected by gravity, but they always break with no drop after falling. They break immediately if pushed by a piston or sticky piston, and cannot be pulled by sticky pistons or slime blocks. They also break immediately without drop when affected by explosion.

In Java Edition, suspicious gravel drops as an item if it falls for more than 30 seconds, which can be achieved by falling into an upward bubble column, or through two cobwebs stacked on top of each other.[1] However, it does not retain its loot.

In Creative mode, the player can obtain suspicious gravel while retaining its loot by using Ctrl + pick block on the block.

1. â†‘Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

### Natural generation
Suspicious gravel generates naturally in cold ocean ruins. Additionally, some of the gravel within trail ruins is replaced with suspicious gravel upon generation.


## Usage
### Brushing
When a brush is used on suspicious gravel, cracks start to appear on all sides of the block as the dusted block state of the block starts to increase. If the suspicious gravel being brushed is naturally generated, an item gradually emerges from the side where the player starts brushing. After 96 (6+20+30+40 per stage) game ticks (4.8 seconds), the item is extracted, and the suspicious gravel is converted into gravel.

If the player stops brushing a suspicious gravel, the block remains in its half-excavated state for a few seconds, before gradually returning to its unexcavated state one stage at a time.

### Loot
The item obtained and the loot table of suspicious gravel is dependent on which structure it has generated in. Items can be extracted only from naturally generated suspicious gravel. When placed by the player, nothing is produced after brushing.

In Java Edition, each trail ruin's suspicious gravel contains 1 item stack,  with the following distribution:
