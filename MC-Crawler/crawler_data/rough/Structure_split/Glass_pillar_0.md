# Java Edition removed features
Since the beginning of the development of Java Edition, there have been a number of features that were removed from the game. These features may have been replaced, or a developer decided against the feature later on.

Note: This page documents only game features that were removed; features of a particular game element that were removed are noted in that element's history. See Java Edition unused features for features that are still currently in the game.

## Player Features
### Player stats
The removed player stats.
In an early Indev version, the player could open the inventory screen and view their name and three stats: "ATK", "DEF", and "SPD". These existed only briefly; when asked, Notch stated he could not remember exactly why they were implemented and subsequently removed, and he assumed they were placeholders for "vague plans".[1]

### Inventory changes
An inventory rewrite was originally partially implemented in snapshot 14w07a, but it was reverted before the release of 1.8.[more information needed][2]

### Old multiplayer player death animation
Before 1.6.1, on player death while playing in multiplayer, the player would stay standing, leap a little bit, and then disappear. In 1.6.1, this was replaced with the player falling onto the side and then disappearing.

### Notch dropping an apple
Before Beta 1.8, the player named Notch would drop an apple upon death.

### On-screen version number
Version display in the top left of the screen (Java Edition Beta 1.6 Test Build 3).
All-text version display in the top left of the screen (PC Gamer Demo).
Starting with Classic 0.0.2a, all subsequent versions until RC2 had text displayed in the top left corner of the screen that displayed the version. Versions between Beta 1.6.4 and Beta 1.7.3 did not have this text. From Classic 0.0.2a to Indev 0.31 20100205, only the version number was displayed, but after Indev it switched from being "0.31" to being called "Minecraft Indev" (Indev 20100206), the word "Minecraft" was shown before the version number. In the Alpha development stage, the text read "Minecraft Alpha v#.#.#(_#)." In the Beta development stage, the text read "Minecraft Beta #.#(_#)." This feature was only partially removed, for, among other things, the version number can now be shown by opening the debug screen while in-game. Before Alpha v1.2.2, the version number did not display on the main menu screen.


### 
"Unlicensed Copy" message in the top left of the screen (Java Edition Beta 1.7.3).
In the Beta stage of Minecraft's development, a message reading "Minecraft Beta #.#.#(_0#) Unlicensed Copy :( (Or logged in from another location). Purchase at minecraft.net" was shown in the top-left corner. This message can be seen only in versions between Beta 1.6 Test Build 3 and Beta 1.7.3, as proven by a bytecode editor. The bytecode for the message was removed in Beta 1.8.
