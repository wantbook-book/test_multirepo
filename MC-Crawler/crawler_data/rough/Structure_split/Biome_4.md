| The Void‌[Java Edition  only] | Can be accessed only through Single Biome world selection or The Void superflat preset. In a single biome world, the landscape consists of stone, as well as water and bedrock depending on the generator type. In The Void superflat preset, the world is completely empty except for a single structure: a 33×33 stone platform with a single block of cobblestone in the center. No mobs (passive or hostile) can spawn without spawn eggs, monster spawners or commands. It also doesn't rain in this biome. | The Void   |

### The Nether
The Nether is considered a different dimension. It is a hellish place; all biomes in this dimension are dry and it is not possible to place water in these biomes; ice can still be placed, though it does not turn into water upon melting.

| Nether Wastes    | The nether wastes is a massive cave that carves through the majority of the dimension. The main terrain consists of netherrack, with glowstone clusters growing and lava leaking from the ceiling and gravel and soul sand lining its shores. It is the most barren Nether biome, but also the easiest to traverse as there is largely no terrain that could possibly block a player's path. The only real threats would be the monsters: the fire-breathing ghasts, the piglins and their undead versions, the powerful magma cubes and the rare enderman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Nether wastes    |
| Soul Sand Valley | The soul sand valley is a large grotto that is extensive and cuts through the Nether's usual terrain. Notable features of the biome are exposed nether fossils in various shapes and sizes, large amounts of lava, blue fog, large spires made of basalt, soul fire and the occasional nether fortress or bastion remnant. The biome itself consists of soul sand, basalt and soul soil. This biome is extremely dangerous to traverse due to the combination of ghasts and skeletons spawning here and soul sand slowing down the player's movement speed, making it easy for a player to get overwhelmed by projectile attacks. In addition, igniting soul sand or soul soil (especially since ghast fireballs start fires near impact point) can create soul fire, which does more damage/second than regular fire if players get caught in it. It is recommended to avoid this biome unless players have sufficient equipment/strategies to navigate the terrain. The Soul Speed enchantment is especially helpful for traveling through this biome.                                                           | Soul sand valley |
| Crimson Forest   | The crimson forest is a “red” crimson-themed biome, with warped and crimson fungus as well as huge crimson fungus scattered around the environment.There are huge fungus structures that contain weeping vines hanging off them and may also have a few blocks of shroomlight. The floor of the biome is covered in crimson nylium, with crimson roots growing. Occasional patches of netherrack and red nether wart blocks are found scattered throughout the biome. In the ceiling, apart from glowstone clusters, there are sparse nether wart block stalactites with vines growing.Piglins, zombified piglins and hoglins naturally spawn in this biome. As long as players equip at least one piece of gold armor, piglins should not cause any trouble. Hoglins can also be repelled by staying close to warped fungus. However, without these countermeasures, this biome can be fairly hostile to navigate. Nevertheless, the abundance of hoglins in this biome makes it a great source of food in the Nether, and the high population of piglins makes this biome an ideal location to barter with them. | Crimson forest   |
| Warped Forest    | The huge fungus structures may have a few blocks of shroomlight scattered around them. The floor of the biome is covered in warped nylium, with warped roots and nether sprouts growing. Occasional patches of raw netherrack and warped wart blocks can be found scattered throughout the biome.Apart from striders, endermen are the only mobs that spawn in this biome, making the warped forest an ideal location to collect ender pearls to access the End. This biome is also a relatively safe place to reside in the Nether, due to the fact that no hostile mobs spawn here. However, do note that other hostile mobs can still spawn from bastion remnants that generate here, as well as from nether fortresses that have cut into a warped forest after generating in another biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Warped forest    |
| Basalt Deltas    | A gray biome, the basalt deltas are said to be the remnant of ancient volcanic eruptions. The ground consists of basalt and blackstone blocks, with small patches of netherrack and pools of lava. The shape of the terrain is chaotic and uneven, making it somewhat difficult to traverse and build on. Unlike the other biomes in the Nether, bastion remnants do not generate in basalt deltas. When this biome borders a lava ocean, clusters of basalt form near the coast.Magma cubes have a high spawn rate in this biome, making the basalt deltas the best place to farm magma cream. This biome also contains a much higher abundance of blackstone compared to other Nether biomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Basalt deltas    |

| The End           | This biome is used to generate the circle of radius 1000 centered at the 0,0 coordinates in the End. The End central island is generated at the center of this circle, and it's surrounded by a complete vacuum all the way to the edge of the biome. Most of the End features are exclusive to that island, including the ender dragon, the obsidian pillars, the end crystals, the 5×5 spawn platform, the exit portal and the 20 central end gateways. Large amounts of endermen spawn in this biome. It does not rain or snow in this biome unlike the other low-temperature biomes. The outer islands in the End can be accessed using end gateways after the ender dragon has been defeated.If the biome is used for a superflat world, the sky appears nearly black and an ender dragon spawns at the 0,0 coordinates in the Overworld. Only endermen spawn at night. | The End           |
| Small End Islands | Generates as part of the outer islands of the End. This biome represents the empty expanse between the larger islands, populated by the smaller, circular islands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Small end islands |
| End Midlands      | Generates as part of the outer islands of the End. This biome represents the gradual slope from the hilltops of each island down to the cliffs around the edge. End cities generate here, but chorus trees do not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | End midlands      |
| End Highlands     | Generates as part of the outer islands of the End. This biome represents the hilltops of each island, and is the only biome in the End where both chorus trees and end cities generate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | End highlands     |
| End Barrens       | Generates as part of the outer islands of the End. This biome represents the outer rims of each island, with steep cliffs below the edge. Neither end cities nor chorus trees generate in this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | End barrens       |
