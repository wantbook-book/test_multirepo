### Starting house
Main article: Starting house
The starting house was a building which generated at the center of Indev maps. The player would spawn inside of the starting house when the world was first generated.

This structure was added in Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100124, and was initially comprised of mossy cobblestone, with two Torches inside. The starting house was reworked in Java Edition Indev 20100214-1, having a stone floor and walls made of oak planks.

Early iterations of the starting house contained a series of chests, which would harbor almost every block and item in the entire game at that point. These chests went through a series of changes, before being removed from the starting house entirely in later iterations.

The starting house was removed at Java Edition Infdev 20100227-1 due to terrain generation being redone to accommodate infinite worlds, ditching the limited worlds of Indev and earlier.

### Obsidian wall
Main article: Obsidian wall
In Java Edition Infdev 20100227-1, two obsidian walls generated in the world as to mark the orthogonal directions. One of these walls would appear where the X-axis was at 0, and another where the Z-axis was 0. The player would spawn at the point where these two walls intersected.

Like with the brick pyramids, these were a debugging feature, and were not implemented as a source of obsidian for players due to the inability for blocks to drop items at the time.

These walls would no longer generate as of Java Edition Infdev 20100313.

### Monolith
Main article: Monolith
Monoliths were a terrain bug which existed from late Infdev to late Alpha. Occurring when the noise generators for handling the shape of terrain output specific values, these structures would consist of the terrain being "inverted" in a given region of space. Outwardly, they appear as sheer stone cliffs which reach the top of the world. Ore and sediment blobs could be seen to generate in the sides of these, as could water and lava springs. Further examination of these reveal that the area underneath these monoliths is completely empty all the way down to the bedrock layers, further proving that the terrain is "inverted", as air regions and solid regions have completely switched places. Water would generate in this empty space below monoliths, as the game would consider any air space below a given point that did not belong to a cave or other structure as an "ocean", and fill it with water accordingly.

Due to being "inverted" sections of terrain, it is exceedingly likely that monoliths would generate up infinitely (or at least up until the vertical Far Lands) were they given sufficient space. Due to their version range, they were limited to 128 blocks. Monoliths could also fully enclose regions of normal terrain - when seen from below, these would appear as sheer cliffs, like all non-monolith terrain.

Monoliths came with the Java Edition Infdev 20100611, which overhauled terrain a third time in the Infdev development period, they persisted up until Java Edition Alpha v1.1.2_01. Alpha v1.2.0 redid terrain generation once more, such that completely different noise generators were used for terrain, which no longer had he potential to cause these bugs. However, despite this, Old Customized worlds were still capable of generating monolith structures by defining a negative "Biome Scale Weight" value[3] from snapshot Java Edition 14w17a for Java Edition 1.8 to snapshot Java Edition 18w05a for 1.13, but with the removal of the "Customized" world type altogether in snapshot Java Edition 18w06a for 1.13, this can no longer be recreated. Monoliths could be generated again from 1.16 to 1.17.1 by using customized worlds to set a biome's scale to a negative number.

### Placeholder trees
Main article: Tree
There are several cases in the game in which unique species of tree use the logs and leaves primarily associated with other trees. Two prominent examples are pine trees, which use spruce logs and leaves, and swamp trees, which use oak logs and leaves, rather than either of these having dedicated blocks. As a result of this, they cannot be grown from saplings, and can only be encountered when generating new chunks.

In Java Edition 1.7.2's development, when biomes were being added to the game, two trees were added to the then-new biomes which also reused the logs and leaves of existing trees. However, these were a temporary measure, as later in development, they were given logs and leaves of their own, alongside saplings, planks and further wood products.

Specifically, these were the acacia tree, and the dark oak tree. The acacia tree reused jungle logs and oak leaves, and dark oak trees used spruce logs and oak leaves.

### Village aspects
Main article: Village
Villages have seen multiple changes in generation since their introduction. Due to these changes, some may consider villages which generated in previous versions, or at least certain buildings within them, as "removed" structures.

#### Old village
Main article: Village/Structures (old)
Old villages and old zombie villages could generate in plains, savanna, taiga, ice plains, and desert biomes. The type of village, and therefore the style of all structures within it, was determined by the biome where the village well was located. All village biome variants were essentially palette swaps of each other, with the exception of one house in the old ice plains village, which would generate with randomized crop items such as carrots and beetroots. The "old villages" were not known as such until Java Edition 1.14.
