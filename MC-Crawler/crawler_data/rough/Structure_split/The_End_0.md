# The End
The End is a dark, space-like dimension consisting of separate islands in the void, made out of end stone. It is inhabited by endermen and shulkers. The ender dragon also spawns when the player first arrives. The End is the end goal of Minecraft. The Ender Dragon is considered the final boss, and it is necessary to defeat it to "beat" the game and see the end credits.

## Accessing
Main article: End Portal
An activated end portal found in a stronghold.
To access the End, the player must go through the process of finding a stronghold using eyes of ender, finding the portal room, and activating the end portal in the end portal room. The room consists of a 5×5 square of end portal frames, with the corners cut out, making a total of 12. The portal hangs over a lava pool, with a staircase leading up to it. A silverfish spawner sits on top of the staircase. 

The player can activate the portal by filling the 12 end portal frames each with an eye of ender. Each frame block has a 10% chance of generating with an eye in it already, meaning the player may not necessarily use 12 eyes to activate it. Once all the eyes of ender are placed, the portal activates and emits a loud noise. As soon as it is activated, the portal destroys all blocks in the central 3×3 square, including bedrock or another portal frame, and replaces them with the end portal blocks that can teleport an entity into the End dimension. Upon jumping into the portal, the player immediately arrives in the End (x: 100, z: 0), along with any prior entities that may have teleported.

If cheats are enabled, players can also teleport to the End without using an end portal: the command /execute in the_end allows the player to select their teleportation destination in the End directly.

## Environment
The End consists of one large island surrounded at a distance by many smaller islands, all mainly composed of end stone. There is a gap between the central island and the outer islands of about 1000 blocks with nothing but the void.

The starless sky and the void of the End are both composed of a blank, static pattern. The daylight cycle is absent in the End, similar to the Nether, being replaced by a constant dim light.

Weather cycle does not exist in the End, meaning there is no rain, snowfall or thunderstorms.

Most items and blocks function in the End exactly as they do in the Overworld, with a few notable exceptions:

- Bedsandrespawn anchorscause anexplosion25% stronger thanTNTand causefireswhen one attempts tousethem, as beds do inthe Netherand respawn anchors in theOverworld. (Villagers, if somehow brought in, can still usebedssafely);
- Compassesare unable to find the originalspawnpoint, as spawn points cannot be set within the End, but compass used onLodestonestill works;
- Clocksare unable to determine the position of thesunandmoon, as there is nodaylight cyclein the End. Clocks instead spin randomly as they do in the Nether;
- Nether portalscannot be activated by theplayerin the End (although they can be placed throughcommandsor externalprograms and editors).
- Fire burns indefinitely onbedrock, but does not naturally spread onto other blocks of bedrock, as withnetherrack.

### Biomes
There are 5 biomes that make up the End in Java Edition. Beds and respawn anchors still explode if the biome is set in the Overworld. In Bedrock Edition, all End biomes are classified as a single biome, which is the_End. In both versions, if the biome is set to "the End" in the Overworld, the sky appears as a light gray version of the normal Overworld sky.

| Central island    | The center of the End is a large, asteroid-like island composed entirely ofend stone, floating in the void. At a distance of 1000 blocks away, an expanse of more islands begins, away from the main island. These consist of large islands, about the size of the main island, and smaller ones, which tend to be thin.                                                            |       |
| Outer islands     | The outer End islands are found 1000 blocks away from the central island. They vary in size from large islands to smaller "mini islands." Generated structures such asend citiesandend shipsspawn here, along withchorus trees. The player can be taken to the End islands through theend gateway.                                                                                  |       |
| End spike         | End spikes, also known as obsidian pillars, obsidian spikes or obsidian towers, aregenerated structuresat the End that are made ofobsidian, with a singlebedrockblock and anend crystalon top of each pillar. Larger ones have cylindrical forms. The pillars surround the exit portal in a roughly 40 block radius circle, and penetrate through the main island down toy level 0. |       |
| Obsidian platform | The obsidian platform is a 5 by 5 square of obsidian that is generated once a player or entity enters the End. If theobsidianis destroyed, or if a block is placed on top of the three air blocks above any part of the platform when the player enters the End, the obsidian is restored and any blocks on top of those three air blocks above the platform are replaced with air. |       |
| Exit portal       | The exit portal (also known as the end fountain) is a structure that enables the players to return to their spawnpoints in theOverworldorthe Nether. It activates upon the defeat of theender dragon.                                                                                                                                                                               |       |
| End gateway       | End gateway portals aregeneratedin the End after defeating theender dragon, and are used to gain quick access to the outer End islands and teleport the player back to the center island.                                                                                                                                                                                           |       |
| End city          | End cities are skyscraper-likestructuresfound on the outer islands of the End. They are inhabited byshulkersand hold exclusiveloot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |       |
| End ship          | End ships are floating structures that are sometimes generated alongside end cities. They are the only places whereelytraand thedragon headcan be legitimately obtained.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |       |
| Chorus tree       | Chorus trees are tall, coral-like blocks ubiquitous in the outer islands. They are composed ofchorus plantsandchorus fruit.
