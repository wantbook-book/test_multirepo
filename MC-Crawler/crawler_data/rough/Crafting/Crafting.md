# Crafting
Crafting is the process of constructing tools, items, and blocks in Minecraft. Items can be crafted using the inventory, a crafting table, or automatically using a crafter‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0]. Players can craft by moving items from their inventory to the crafting grid, arranging them according to a recipe. A 2×2 crafting grid can be accessed from the player's inventory and a 3×3 grid can be accessed by using a crafting table. Items crafted in the 2×2 grid can also be crafted in the crafting table. The 3×3 grid is needed to craft complex items.

## Crafting system
### Manual crafting
2×2 Crafting grid (inventory)
3×3 Crafting grid (crafting table)
Players in Survival, Adventure, or Spectator have access to the 2×2 crafting grid from their inventory screen. Small crafting recipes that are at most 2×2 can be made there. These include wooden planks, sticks, crafting tables, torches and some shapeless recipes. To craft items using a bigger grid to allow more crafting recipes, create a crafting table with 4 wooden planks, place it in the world, and press use while facing it. This brings up an interface with a larger, 3×3 crafting grid, which the player can use to craft any crafting recipe in the game. There is also a recipe book where the player can access all the crafting recipes.

Some recipes do not require their ingredients to be arranged in a specific way on the crafting grid. These are commonly known as shapeless recipes. For example, players may craft a fermented spider eye by placing its ingredients anywhere within the grid or like a flint and steel can be crafted in any orientation.

On the contrary, many recipes must have their ingredients placed in the correct relative positions on the crafting grid. These are commonly known as shaped recipes. Ingredients in shaped recipes can be ‘moved’ up, down, left, or right. They can also be flipped side-ways. For example, a 3×1 recipe, such as bread, can be made using the top, middle, or bottom row of the 3×3 grid, and a bow may be made with the strings placed on the left instead of on the right.

There are recipes that may not be moved or mirrored in this way. These are commonly known as fixed recipes. For example, dyes in banner recipes - only available in Bedrock Edition - must be specifically placed to achieve the desired pattern. Fixed recipes can be added by data packs, add-ons, or mods.

Unlike other in-game actions such as smelting, brewing, and enchanting, crafting is completely silent.

### Automated crafting
Main article: Crafter

  

This section describes an experimental feature in Java Edition and Bedrock Edition. 
This feature has appeared only in Java Edition 1.20.3 and Bedrock Edition 1.20.50 development versions so far. This feature is not enabled in-game by default and requires enabling the "Update 1.21" experimental data pack in Java Edition or the "Update 1.21" setting in the "Experiments" section in Bedrock Edition.


‌In Java Edition 1.21 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.0‌[upcoming], crafting can be automated using the crafter.

The simplest way to do this is for the player to add the items for the crafting into the crafter manually, however this process can itself be automated using hoppers. In order to control which slots the hopper puts the item into it is possible to disable certain slots to prevent the input of items. When items are put into a crafter automatically they fill every enabled slot equally from left to right and top to bottom, in that order. If all slots are disabled, then hoppers connected to it cannot put items in it. 

The crafter can craft what a normal crafting table can craft.

Automated crafting is very useful in both storage systems and automated farms, as it provides a way to automatically craft items and blocks that once required manual input.

### Recipe book
Main article: Recipe book
The recipe book is a mechanic in Minecraft that serves as a catalog of recipes and as a crafting guide. It shows every crafting recipe that the player has had materials for. 

Crafting recipes are organized in several different categories. The categories differ between Java and Bedrock. On Bedrock, categories consist of craftable items from each Creative inventory tab. In Java Edition, the categories are as follows:

- The first tab contains every unlocked recipe.
- The second tab contains utility items,tools,weapons, andarmor.
- The third tab contains building materials.
- The fourth tab containsfoodand miscellaneous items.
- The fifth tab containsredstonematerials.

Recipes, including crafting recipes, can be configured by data packs in Java Edition or add-ons in Bedrock Edition.

## Complete recipe list
To save space, some recipes are animated (requires JavaScript). On this wiki, shapeless recipes are marked with a pair of intertwined arrows on the crafting table graphic, while fixed crafting recipes are marked by an exclamation point. These symbols do not appear in the game.
