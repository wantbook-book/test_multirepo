# Tutorials/The Void
This page lists ways of reaching the void.

Note: The page only considers the space above the Nether as the void due to being obstructed by bedrock, like the void below each dimension.

Note: Falling below the map will certainly kill a player in Survival or Adventure mode, and in Java Edition, players in Creative Mode will also die in the void. This does not apply above the Nether Roof.

## Cheats
- Teleport below the layer 0 using/tp (<targets>|<destination>|<x>).
- Make a hole using/fill ~ 0 ~ ~ ~ ~ air.
- Spawn an explosive entity powerful enough to break bedrock (e.g. spawning a creeper using/summon creeper ~ ~ ~ {Fuse:0,ExplosionPower:5000}), and break bedrock with it. (Note: Entities, redstone, and block updates will cease while the blast loads)

### 
- Teleport above the layer 127 using/tp (<targets>|<destination>|<x>).
- Make a hole using/fill ~ ~ ~ ~ 128 ~ air.
	- Can be also done with map editors.
- The top of the Nether is a flat bedrock surface.

## Creative
- Break the bedrock with your fist.

- Use one of the cheats listed above.

## Survival
### Default
There is no way to get to the void in the Overworld or the Nether (except a bug), as the bedrock includes a layer with no holes (except an error or opening a LAN server with cheats enabled). However, if a generated structure generates very low in the world, especially an igloo with a basement, it can override bedrock. However, this is extremely rare and it will probably not generate in your world unless you use a seed with one. A much easier way to get to the Void is through The End:

- Jump off the island.
- Dig your way through to the bottom of the island.
- Get knocked off the island by theender dragon, by an angryenderman, or while fighting at the edge of the island.

You can also get on the top of the Nether due to a bug which can be performed (you will need at least 2 ender pearls or more):

- Dig a hole up to the bedrock;
- Find three bedrock blocks in a line at height 127, the highest layer of bedrock (you can press F3, point to the bedrock and check the second number on the "Looking at" line). The first block must have two air blocks below it: the player needs to go there. The second and the third bedrock blocks must have an air block below them and another bedrock block below the air;
- Teleport with an ender pearl below the third block: you will suffocate in the bedrock;
- Jump and throw an ender pearl on the top of the Nether: you have arrived.

### Superflat
- If using a Superflat map without bedrock layers, one can mine through the bottom and reach the void.
- If using the "the void" preset, either mine through the starting platform or jump off the side of the platform.
- Alternatively, the 'Bottomless Pit' preset for Superflat worlds will create a layer of cobblestone where the bedrock would be, which can easily be mined to reach the void.

## 
- Store items in anender chestor type/gamerule keepInventory true, then kill your character. As long as there is another ender chest placed (and all items are stored), no items are lost. However, the player should keep in mind that they will lose their experience if they do this if they did not enable Keep Inventory.
- Build a portal on the Nether's top and go through it. Keep in mind the player could die of fall damage, if very high up.
- Use a glitch tobreak bedrockand get back down from the Nether roof.

## Void base
If you want to set up a base in the void, make a 3×3 hole in the bedrock and put a block in the middle. Then quickly spawn a chicken on it, break the block, replace it with a fence and tie the chicken to that fence. Then place a block above the fence and put more fences on all four faces of the block. Then break the block on the first fence and put slabs on the top halves of the corners of the 3×3 hole. Lastly, place boats on the slabs and row them in between the fences, break the slabs (preferably with hitboxes shown) and let the boats fall. Repeat this process for a larger base. For storage use llamas or donkeys with chests, or minecarts with chests. For food, use mooshrooms, as milking them with bowls give you mushroom soup. Remember to name mobs or they despawn.
