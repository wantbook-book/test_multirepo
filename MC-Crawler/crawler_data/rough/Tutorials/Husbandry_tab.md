## Husbandry
The world is full of friends and food

Requirements: Eat any item that can be eaten.

Eat any type of food, other than a cake. It doesn't matter whether it's a pufferfish, a golden apple, or bread; as long as it is a type of food, you will get the advancement. Even drinks like potions and milk buckets count.

## Bee Our Guest
Use a Campfire to collect Honey from a Beehive using a Bottle without aggravating the bees

Requirements: Without provoking the bees, place a lit campfire under a beehive or bee nest, then harvest honey from it.

First, get a campfire. It can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients                                                                                                                       | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Stick+<br/>Coalor<br/>Charcoal+<br/>AnyLogorStemor<br/>AnyStripped LogorStemor<br/>AnyWoodorHyphaeor<br/>AnyStripped WoodorHyphae |                 |

Campfires also generate in villages and ancient cities, but picking them up requires a tool with Silk Touch. They can also be bought from fisherman villagers.

Next, you need either a bee nest or a beehive. Bee nests generate on trees only in few biomes. Within these, each tree has a fixed chance to spawn a bee nest. Every bee nest generates along with 3 bees.

| Biome                                                           | Chance |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Meadow                                                          | 100%   |
| Cherry Grove<br/>Plains<br/>Sunflower plains<br/>Mangrove Swamp | 5%     |
| Flower forest                                                   | 2%     |
| Forest<br/>Birch forest<br/>Old growth birch forest             | 0.2%   |

Alternatively, you can also craft a beehive like so:

| Ingredients              | Crafting recipe |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| AnyPlanks+<br/>Honeycomb |                 |

Then, get a glass bottle. It can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Glass       | 3               |

Other methods of obtaining glass bottles include drinking potions, fishing, and killing witches.

Place the campfire directly under the beehive or bee nest. The campfire's smoke will reach the beehive if it is within five blocks below it. Now you have to wait until bees fill up the hive with honey; this is indicated by a changed texture of the block and honey particles dripping from it. Bees can fill up their hive only if there is something nearby that they can pollinate:

- flowers(other than wither roses),
- flowering azaleas,
- flowering azalea and cherryleaves,
- mangrove propagules,
- spore blossoms,
- chorus flowers.

The plant can't be inside of a flower pot.
When the beehive/bee nest is filled up, use a bottle on it; you will get a honey bottle and the advancement.

## The Parrots and the Bats
Breed two animals together

Requirements: Breed two breedable mobs together.

Use one breedable mob with the item that they can breed with, and then use the same type of mob nearby with that item. They will come together and make a baby (or in some cases, lay an egg). As soon as the breeding is done, you will be granted the advancement.

There are 25 types of breedable mobs: for a complete list, see Two by Two below. Cows, sheep and chickens are probably the easiest animals to breed in early-game, as they are common and don't require very expensive items. Cows and sheep breed with wheat, while chickens breed with seeds. You can also, for example, breed tamed wolves with any type of meat and tamed cats with a raw cod or raw salmon.

Note that, despite the name of this advancement, you can't actually breed parrots or bats.

## 
Have an Allay deliver items to you

Requirements: An allay must deliver an item to you.

First, find an allay. They can only spawn in woodland mansion jail cells and pillager outpost cages; both of these structures are quite rare. Outposts are a bit more common, but mansions are recommended for finding allays for two reasons:

- not every outpost has allays, while almost every mansion spawns some;
- cartographervillager can sell a map pointing directly to a mansion, while there is no good method of finding outposts.

After you find an allay, get any two identical items. Give the allay one of them (use the allay with an item), and drop the other one on the ground. The allay will pick up the item on the ground and throw it to you, awarding you the advancement.

Parent of: Birthday Song

## 
Get in Boat and float with a Goat

Requirements: Enter a boat that is occupied with a goat

First, prepare a boat (not a boat with chest!). Next, locate a goat; they only spawn in three mountain biomes: frozen peaks, jagged peaks and snowy slopes.

When you have found a goat, place a boat on the block right next to the goat. Push the animal inside if needed; lead might also be useful. When the goat enters the boat, use the boat to enter yourself. You will then get the advancement.

## Best Friends Forever
Tame an animal

Requirements: Tame a tameable mob.

Tame one of the 10 tamable mobs in the game: parrot, cat, wolf, horse, skeleton horse, zombie horse, donkey, mule, llama or trader llama.

- Parrots spawn injungles. They can be tamed byusingthem with any type ofseeds.
- Cats spawn invillages. They can be tamed withraw codorraw salmon.
- Wolves spawn naturally inforests,taigas,old growth taigas,snowy taigasandgroves. They can be tamed withbones. Beware that if you accidentally attack an untamed wolf, it and its whole pack will start attacking you, similarly tozombified piglins.
- Horses and donkeys spawn inplains,savannasand their variants. Horses can also spawn in villages, and donkeys can spawn inmeadows.Mulesare obtained frombreedinga horse and a donkey. To tame a horse, donkey or mule keepusingthem withan empty hand. The first few times they may buck you off, but eventually, they will let you stay on and heart particles will appear. This means that you have tamed them successfully.
- Llamas spawn in savanna andwindswept hills. Two trader llamas spawn leashed to awandering trader. Similarly to horse-like mobs, to tame a llama, keepusingthem withan empty handuntil heart particles appear. With a trader llama, it must be unleashed first.
- Skeleton horses and zombie horses cannot be tamed normally, but using/ride, they can be tamed just like a regular horse.

Once you have tamed one of these mobs, you will be rewarded the advancement. Naturally spawned skeleton horses and camels do not count as they are already tamed.

Parent of: A Complete Catalogue

## 
Make the text of a sign glow

Requirements: Use a glow ink sac on a sign

First, you need a glow ink sac. These drop only from glow squids, which spawn in water below Y=30 in light level 0. As ocean biomes very rarely reach this depth, you should probably look in underground aquifers. At least one glow ink sac always drops when a glow squid dies.

Next, craft either a normal sign or a hanging sign:

| Name         | Ingredients                                                                                | Crafting recipe |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Sign         | MatchingPlanks+<br/>Stick                                                                  | 33333333333     |
| Hanging Sign | Chain+<br/>MatchingStripped Logor<br/>Block of Stripped Bambooor<br/>MatchingStripped Stem | 66666666666     |

Signs also naturally generate in igloo basements and taiga villages.

Place the sign down and write any text on it. Then use a glow ink sac on the written sign. You will then be granted the advancement.

## Fishy Business
Catch a fish

Requirements: Use a fishing rod and catch a fish.

First, you need to get a fishing rod. You can craft it like so:

| Ingredients       | Crafting recipe |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Stick+<br/>String |                 |

You can also find these in ocean ruins chests, from a drowned drop, or buy from a Fisherman villager.

Now find a body of water and throw the bobber in the water (use the rod for that). Bubbles will appear next to the bobber, indicating that something is in the water. Once the bobber dips in the water, quickly reel it in. To get the advancement, you need to catch a fish, not treasure/junk items (you can only catch treasure loot by fishing in open waters). If you didn't get a fish, try again. More information can be found on the fishing page.

There is also a quicker way of getting this advancement: kill any fish, drop the item you got (either raw cod, raw salmon, tropical fish or pufferfish) and pull it with a fishing rod. This can be done even on land.

Parent of: Tactical Fishing

## Total Beelocation
Move a Bee Nest, with 3 bees inside, using Silk Touch

First, you need to find a bee nest (see Bee Our Guest above). You will also need any tool enchanted with Silk Touch, although axes are the fastest.

At night or during rain, all bees from a given nest go back to it for a rest. All naturally generated bee nests have three bees inside at the beginning, but they may get lost on the way back to their nest or get killed. Thus, there is no guarantee that a given nest still has all of its original bees inside. Sadly there is also no way to check it without commands.

When you break the bee nest with a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, it will drop as an item, with the bees still inside it, and the bees will not be angry at you. If you don't break it with Silk Touch, the nest will drop nothing, and the bees will be angry. You must break the nest quickly, otherwise the bees can escape before you break it. Once you break the nest, you should get the advancement; if you didn't get it, this means that the nest didn't have all 3 bees inside and you must attempt the advancement with another one.

## Bukkit Bukkit
Catch a tadpole in a Bucket

Requirements: Use a water bucket to catch a tadpole.

First, find either a swamp or a mangrove swamp, as these are the only two biomes where frogs spawn. You will also need a water bucket and at least two slimeballs. These drop from slimes, which also spawn in swamps, but only at night. Slime spawning in swamp biomes also depends on the phase of the moon; the closer it is to full moon, the more slimes will spawn. At new moon, no slimes spawn at all.

Use a slimeball on two frogs to breed them. Frogs breed differently to most mobs: instead of a baby frog appearing, one of the frogs lays frogspawn on a water block nearby. You can't pick this block up even with Silk Touch, so you must wait until it hatches: this takes 10 minutes. When time has passed, 2-5 tadpoles will spawn in place of the frogspawn block. Use your water bucket on one of the tadpoles. This will catch it in the bucket and grant you the advancement.

## Smells Interesting
Obtain a Sniffer Egg

Requirements: Have a sniffer egg in your inventory.

First two sniffer eggs on any Survival world must be brushed from suspicious sand in warm ocean ruins. Any suspicious sand block in a warm ocean ruin has 6.7% chance to contain a sniffer egg. 

If you play on multiplayer, you can also get the advancement by breeding two sniffers that someone else got earlier. Sniffers breed with torchflower seeds and the egg is dropped on the ground after breeding, unlike the turtle egg, which gets placed in the world.

As soon as you get the sniffer egg in your inventory, you will be rewarded the advancement. 

This is a hidden advancement, meaning that it can only be viewed when the player has completed the advancement.

## A Seedy Place
Plant a seed and watch it grow

Requirements: Plant any type of seed.

Plant one of seven types of seeds:

- Beetroot
- Melon
- Nether Wart
- Pumpkin
- Wheat
- Torchflower
- Pitcher.

Six of these can be planted by using them on farmland. The only exception is nether wart, which must be planted on soul sand.

Wheat seeds are the easiest to acquire—they sometimes drop from punching short grass or tall grass. The advancement is given as soon as the seed is planted, you do not have to wait for it to grow.

## Wax On
Apply Honeycomb to a Copper block!

Requirements: Use a honeycomb on any copper block.

First, you need a honeycomb. Locate a beehive or bee nest with honey (see Bee Our Guest above). A campfire placed underneath it is not necessary, but recommended, so that the bees will not get angry. Then, get a pair of shears. They can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Iron Ingot  |                 |

Shears can also be bought from shepherd villagers.

Use shears on the beehive filled with honey (texture change and honey particles dripping indicate that). You will acquire 3 honeycombs.

Next, you will need to get a block of copper, crafted like so:

| Ingredients  | Crafting recipe |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Copper Ingot |                 |

Copper ore can be found most often generating at Y level 47 to 48. When mining it, remember to use a pickaxe better than wooden, the ore will drop either raw copper or itself (the latter will only drop if you're using Silk Touch). Smelting either raw copper or copper ore will result in a copper ingot. Alternatively, you can get copper ingots rarely from drowned drops.

Place the block of copper down, and use the honeycomb on the block of copper. You will then get the advancement. Even if you already had a block of copper placed before and it oxidized, it will work.

Parent of: Wax Off

## Wax Off
Scrape Wax off of a Copper block!

Requirements: Use an axe to revert any waxed copper block.

Refer to the Wax On advancement tutorial to see how to obtain a waxed block of copper.

Once you have obtained the block, place it down and use any type of axe on it. As soon as you do that, the wax layer will be stripped off the block, and you will be awarded the advancement. Note that this does not have to be the same block that you got the Wax On advancement from.

## Two by Two
Breed all the animals!

Requirements: Breed a pair of all 24 types of mobs that are possible to breed.

Breed at least a pair of every breedable mob, except trader llama, in any order.

To breed a pair of mobs, they must be within few blocks of each other, and you must use both of them with a specific item. You can lure mobs by holding the item they want in your hand. Leads may also help with that, in case of most mobs. There are 25‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80] types of mobs on the list: most of them require a different item to breed, and sometimes additional requirements must be met. Full list of these mobs, items, requirements and methods is in the table below.

Note that any two mobs of the same species can breed with each other, as all Minecraft mobs are single-sex. Also, different variant of the same mob species can breed just fine (e.g. brown mooshroom and red mushroom, aggressive panda and playful panda, etc.). In case of mobs that lay eggs (sniffers, frogs and turtles), note that you do not have to wait until the egg that they laid hatches.

Also, both golden foods can be found in various loot chests.Enchanted golden applesalso work, but are not recommended, as normal golden apples and golden carrots are much easier to obtain. |

Additional notes:

- As trader llamas don't count as llamas, they are not required to breed for this advancement. However, theycanbe bred forThe Parrots and the Bats.
- Breedingvillagersis also not required, as that is not an event that the player can cause directly.
- Other mobs with baby variants, such aspolar bearsorpiglins, can't breed in the first place.
- Allayandshulkerduplication is not counted as breeding.

A way to check which mobs a player has bred is introduced in the "Adventuring Time" section, which also applies to this advancement; the only difference is that the entry to look for is minecraft:husbandry/bred_all_animals.

As soon as the last pair of mobs is bred, you will get the advancement. Completing it will reward the player 100 experience.

## Birthday Song
Have an Allay drop a Cake at a Note Block

Requirements: An allay must drop a cake at a note block.

First, get two cakes and a note block. You can craft them like so:

| Name       | Ingredients                                | Crafting recipe |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Cake       | Milk Bucket+<br/>Sugar+<br/>Egg+<br/>Wheat |                 |
| Note Block | AnyPlanks+<br/>Redstone Dust               |                 |

Alternatively, cakes can be bought from some farmer villagers, and note blocks can be found in ancient cities.

Next, you must find an allay (see You've Got a Friend in Me). Once you find the allay, give it a cake (use the allay with the cake). Place down the note block and use it; if the allay is close enough, small particle will travel from the note block to allay, indicating that the mob noticed its new destination block. When that happens, drop the other cake on the ground. Allay will fly to it, pick up the cake, then fly to note block and drop the cake. When the cake is dropped, you should get the advancement.

## A Complete Catalogue
Tame all cat variants!

Requirements: Tame at least one of all of the 11 different cat variants.

You will need to tame at least 11 cats. Each cat on average takes two raw cod or raw salmon to get tamed, so prepare about half a stack of these. Raw fish are usually obtained from fishing or killing fish mobs. 

You need to tame all cat variants in the game. To tame a stray cat, you have to hold the raw fish in your hand, then slowly approach it. Cats will flee from you if you get too close, approach too quickly, or even move the camera too much, so you should slowly sneak toward the mob with minimum camera movement. Eventually, the stray cat will start crawling toward you as well. Once it comes to a stop in front of your feet, use it with the fish several times until red hearts appear on top of the cat, showing that it is now tamed. 

Each cat variant has a different appearance and a different name:

- "Black" (black with orange eyes)
- "British Shorthair" (silver with yellow eyes)
- "Calico" (orange, white and dark brown with yellow and blue eyes)
- "Jellie" (gray and white with gray-green eyes)
- "Persian" (creamy with blue eyes and flat faces)
- "Ragdoll" (white and soft amber with blue eyes)
- "Red" (orange and white with green eyes)
- "Siamese" (white and pale brown with blue eyes)
- "Tabby" (brown and white with yellow eyes)
- "Tuxedo" (black and white with green eyes)
- "White" (white with light blue and yellow eyes)

Cats only spawn in villages and swamp huts. A swamp hut always spawns one black cat, along with a witch. For a village to spawn a cat, there needs to be at least 5 villagers and 5 beds, so make sure to increase the villager population if it's not big enough. A maximum of 5 cats can spawn in one village; if you tamed all cats in one village, either move them far away so that more stray cats can continue to spawn here, or pick another village. 

Black cats are the only ones with special requirements to spawn: it can happen only in swamp huts or during full moon.

Once you successfully tame all 11 cat variants, you will be awarded the advancement. Completing this advancement will reward the player 50 experience.

## Tactical Fishing
Catch a fish... without a fishing rod!

Requirements: Catch a fish with a water bucket.

Prepare a water bucket. You need a live fish: they are naturally found in any aquatic biome. This includes oceans, rivers and aquifers in lush caves. Use the water bucket on any type of fish; if you accidentally empty your bucket instead of catching the fish, you need to fill it again with water before next attempt. Once you have obtained the bucket of fish (a bucket of cod, bucket of salmon, bucket of pufferfish, or a bucket of tropical fish), you will be rewarded the advancement.

## When the Squad Hops into Town
Get each Frog variant on a Lead

Requirements: Use a lead on all three variants of frogs at least once (they do not have to be leashed simultaneously!).

This advancement can be performed in parallel to With Our Powers Combined.

You need to get yourself at least one lead. You can craft it like so:

| Ingredients           | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| String+<br/>Slimeball | 2               |

Leads also generate in chests in ancient cities and woodland mansions, and can be brushed from suspicious gravel in trail ruins. Also, a naturally spawned wandering trader always spawns with two trader llamas attached to it via leads. When they are detached, leads drop as an item on the ground.

When you obtained leads, you need to leash all three variants of a frog: a temperate one (orange), a warm one (white) and a cold one (green). First two can spawn naturally in swamp and mangrove swamp biomes, respectively; there is a very small chance that a green frog spawns naturally when one of those biomes border a snowy biome. However, a better method of getting frog variants is to grow them by yourself.

When you find your first frogs, leash one of them: use a lead on the frog. You can then unleash it immediately (use again). Then, breed two frogs with slimeballs. One of the frogs will then lay frogspawn on a nearby block of water. Wait 10 minutes until it hatches and catch at least two tadpoles (see Bukkit Bukkit above).

Next step depends on which type of frog you found first. If you found an orange one, you will now need a warm biome, like a desert. If you found a white one, go to a moderate biome, like plains. Complete list of biomes in all three categories can be found here.

Dig one block in the ground and place tadpole in the hole. Wait until it grows up. This takes 20 minutes, but the time can be sped up by feeding slimeballs to the tadpole. After time has passed, tadpole grows up into an adult frog: there is a chance that this happens in such a way that the frog will immediately start suffocating. To prevent such an event, you can use a 3×3×3 glass cube with tadpole inside (mobs do not suffocate in glass), like so:

A cage preventing frog from suffocation
When you have the second frog type, leash it. Repeat a similar procedure in a cold biome, like snowy plains: note that water freezes in these biomes, so you need to either encase it with the glass cage, or put a strong light source nearby. When you leashed all frog types, you will get the advancement.

## Little Sniffs
Feed a Snifflet

Requirements: Feed a snifflet (baby sniffer) with torchflower seeds.

You need to obtain torchflower seeds and feed them to any baby sniffer: use the torchflower seeds on a baby sniffer to feed it. If you don't have sniffers yet, you have to get at least two sniffer eggs (see Smells Interesting above). Prepare yourself for a lot of waiting, as process described below takes around an hour.

Place down one of the eggs—preferably on a moss block, since it takes half the time to hatch on moss. The hatching area should be surrounded with a fence, and inside of it there should be some dirt or grass blocks for the sniffer to dig. After 20 minutes (10 minutes on moss), a baby sniffer will hatch. Now you need for it to grow up: this takes 40 minutes. The process can be sped up only with torchflower seeds, but since this is your first sniffer, you don't have those yet, so you have to wait.

About 10 minutes before the sniffer grows up (30 minutes after it hatched) you can place a second egg down, preferably on a moss block as well. 10 minutes later your first sniffer will become an adult, and the second sniffer will hatch. Adult sniffer will start to dig in the ground: it has a 50% chance to dig up torchflower seeds and 50% to dig up pitcher pods, which do not work for this advancement. After digging, the sniffer has an 8-minute cooldown before it can dig again, so during 40-minute timer of the second sniffer growing up, you should have at least 4 diggings performed by the first one. Statistically, at least one of those should result in torchflower seeds, which you can then feed to the snifflet. This will grant you the advancement.

If you were very unlucky and the second sniffer grew up before you got any torchflower seeds, you don't need to brush any suspicious blocks again for the next sniffer egg: simply breed two sniffers you got and they will drop you another egg.

This is a hidden advancement, meaning that it can only be viewed when the player has completed the advancement.

## A Balanced Diet
Eat everything that is edible, even if it's not good for you

Requirements: Eat every food item that can be eaten.

Eat everything that can be eaten in the game, excluding cake. Drinks, like milk and potions, are also excluded.

There are 40 food items in total that you need to eat for this advancement. Here is a list of them, with an easiest (but not the only) method to obtain the item:

Some alternative methods of getting the items include:

- All fish types can be obtained fromfishing;
- Cooked meat and fish drop from mobs if they were killed by fire;
- Carrots and potatoes can rarely drop from zombies;
- Apples, bread, cookies, golden carrots, pumpkin pies and suspicious stew can be bought fromFarmervillagers;
- Cooked porkchop, cooked chicken and rabbit stew can be bought fromButchervillagers;
- Most items, including golden apples, golden carrots, glow berries, poisonous potatoes, pumpkin pies and sweet berries can be found in various loot chests;
- Mushroom stew and suspicious stew can be obtained byusingan emptybowlson red and brownmooshrooms, respectively. Brown mooshroom must be fed aflowerfirst.

The player can check their progress on this advancement in 3 ways:

- The easiest way is to go to the advancement tab and check the progress bar for this advancement. It showshow manyof the 40 foods have been eaten before, but notwhichfoods.
- A more detailed but tedious way is to go to the "Items" section instatistics, and check the "Used" column (the 4th column from the left). All items that has been used (including eaten) at least once has a value greater than 1. This way, the player knows which items have been eaten, but since all items are sorted on the same chart, the player needs to filter out food items from non-food items (e.g. bow), which can take some effort.
- The most reliable way requires access to the world files. The exact procedure is described in the"Adventuring Time"section, which also applies to this advancement; the only difference is that the entry to look for isminecraft:husbandry/balanced_diet.

Eating all 40 foods grants the advancement. Completing it will reward the player 100 experience.

## Serious Dedication
Use a Netherite ingot to upgrade a hoe, and then reevaluate your life choices

Requirements: Have a netherite hoe in your inventory.

Getting a netherite hoe requires four things:

- Diamond hoe, either crafted or bought fromToolsmithvillager
- Netherite ingot, either crafted fromancient debrisandgold ingotsor found inbastionloot chests
- Netherite upgrade, found exclusively in bastion loot chests
- Smithing table.

Once you have all of those, place the smithing table down and upgrade your diamond hoe to a netherite one like so:

| Ingredients                                     | Smithing recipe |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Netherite Upgrade +Diamond Hoe +Netherite Ingot | Upgrade Gear    |

The advancement will be rewarded as soon as you have the netherite hoe in your inventory. Completing it will reward the player 100 experience.

## The Cutest Predator
Catch an axolotl in a bucket

Requirements: Use a water bucket on an axolotl.

Similarly to the Tactical Fishing and Bukkit Bukkit advancements above, you will need a water bucket.

Next, find an axolotl. They spawn in water in lush caves above clay blocks. This is an underground biome, but you can occasionally find azalea trees on the surface; they indicate that there is a lush cave beneath them.

Once you have located an axolotl, use your water bucket on it. This will put the axolotl inside of the bucket and grant you the advancement. If you accidentally empty your bucket instead of catching the axolotl, you need to fill it again with water before next attempt.

## 
Have all Froglights in your inventory.

Requirements: Have a pearlescent, ochre, and verdant froglight in your inventory at the same time.

This advancement can be performed in parallel to When the Squad Hops into Town.

You need to have all 3 types of froglight in your inventory at the same time. Froglights drop from smallest magma cubes when they get eaten by frogs, and color of a froglight depends on the color of a frog that was used: verdant froglight comes from a green (cold) frog, ochre froglight comes from an orange (temperate) frog, and pearlescent froglight comes from a white (warm) frog.

As these mobs live in different dimensions, you will either have to bring frogs into the Nether, or magma cubes into the Overworld. First method is recommended, as frogs do not attack you and can be leashed, thus are easier to transport. You can build a nether portal after obtaining each type of frog and move the animal to the Nether. Use leads and boats, or attract it with a slimeball. Then, find a closest magma cube.

The exact method depends quite a lot on the world you got. If you spawn in a very rough Nether terrain and can't find any easy way to get to magma cubes, you can try a reverse approach: find a basalt delta first, as in this biome magma cubes spawn the most, build a portal there, and move the frog in the Overworld to that location.

Once you have all 3 froglights in your inventory at once, you will be granted the advancement. However, completing it will reward the player no experience, despite it being a challenge advancement.

## 
Team up with an axolotl and win a fight

Requirements: Have the Regeneration effect applied from assisting an axolotl or it killing a mob.

Refer to The Cutest Predator guide to find how to get a bucket of axolotl. You should get more than one axolotl in case you fail on the first attempt. Preparing a diamond/netherite axe with high level of Sharpness or Smite will also help, as well as a helmet with Respiration or a potion of Water Breathing, although these items are not strictly necessary.

When you have an axolotl, locate an underwater hostile mob. A singular drowned without a trident is recommended, as this is the easiest mob to kill, although guardians and elder guardians in theory work as well.

Release your axolotl from the bucket and let it hit the hostile mob once. Then, kill the hostile mob as fast as possible: a diamond axe with Smite V will one-shot the drowned and not damage the axolotl from sweeping effect, like sword does. You will get the Regeneration effect if the axolotl is still alive and not in the "playing dead" state, which it may enter once it was hit by your enemy. However, there is no good way to avoid that: axolotls will target mobs only if they are in water, where drowned and guardians will attack them back.

You will be granted the advancement if axolotl applied the regeneration effect to you.

## Planting the Past
Plant any Sniffer seed

Requirements: Plant either a torchflower seed or a pitcher pod on farmland.

First, you need to get sniffers: refer to the guide on Little Sniffs. Adult sniffers dig in dirt or grass blocks, searching for torchflower seeds and pitcher pods, about once every 8 minutes. When they find those, either type of seed pops up from the ground. You can then collect it and plant on a farmland block, which will grant you the advancement.

This is a hidden advancement, meaning that it can only be viewed when the player has completed the advancement.
