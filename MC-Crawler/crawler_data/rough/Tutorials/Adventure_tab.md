## Adventure
Adventure, exploration, and combat

Requirements: Kill a mob, or get killed by a mob or player.

You can try to find animals to kill (e.g. cows), or wait until nighttime or enter a cave to kill a hostile mob (e.g. zombie). The other, less wanted alternative is to die from a hostile mob at nighttime or in caves. Overall, no special attention is needed to get this advancement.

## Voluntary Exile
Kill a raid captain. Maybe consider staying away from villages for the time being...

Requirements: Kill an illager captain, either from an illager patrol or a pillager outpost.

There are three ways of getting this advancement. You could just wait for an illager patrol to happen and find the raid captain: it is a pillager with an ominous banner on its head. Killing it will grant the advancement. Note that illager patrols are somewhat uncommon, and they can get really rare if you play on a large multiplayer server.

Alternatively, you can find a pillager outpost and wait for a raid captain to spawn in. Once you kill it, you will get the same result. This method is more reliable on larger servers.

If you dealt finishing blow to the captain yourself (in other words, it didn't die from fall damage, fire etc.) you will get the Bad Omen effect. This will cause a raid to start if you enter a village in the next 100 minutes. If that is not what you want, make sure to drink a bucket of milk as soon as you get the advancement. If you don't have milk with you, find the nearest cow, mooshroom or goat, and milk it.

Finally, if you play on multiplayer and you join a raid that someone else started, you can get this advancement by killing either a pillager, evoker or vindicator in one of the waves that is wearing the ominous banner.

This is a hidden advancement, meaning that it can only be viewed when the player has completed the advancement.

## 
Look at a parrot through a spyglass

Requirements: Use a spyglass while aiming at a parrot.

First, craft a spyglass:

| Ingredients                      | Crafting recipe |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Amethyst Shard+<br/>Copper Ingot |                 |

Then, locate a parrot, which are only found in jungle and bamboo jungle biomes. Use the spyglass and look through it at the parrot. Once you do that, you will be granted the advancement.

Parent of: Is It a Balloon?

## Monster Hunter
Kill any hostile monster

Requirements: Kill a hostile mob.

There are 36‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21] mobs that count, here is a complete list:

- Blaze
- Bogged‌[upcoming]
- Breeze‌[upcoming]
- Cave Spider
- Creeper
- Drowned
- Elder Guardian
- Ender Dragon
- Enderman
- Endermite
- Evoker
- Ghast
- Guardian
- Hoglin
- Husk
- Magma Cube
- Phantom
- Piglin
- Piglin Brute
- Pillager
- Ravager
- Shulker
- Silverfish
- Skeleton
- Slime
- Spider
- Stray
- Vex
- Vindicator
- Witch
- Wither
- Wither Skeleton
- Zoglin
- Zombie
- Zombified Piglin
- Zombie Villager

Note that killing wardens, despite them being hostile monsters, can't trigger this advancement.

You can use any type of item or your bare hands to kill the monster, but it is recommended to have a weapon (like a bow, sword or axe) to decrease your chances of being killed yourself. It is also recommended to earn this advancement on a common, easy-to-kill monster, like a zombie or spider.

## The Power of Books
Read the powered signal of a Chiseled Bookshelf using a Comparator

Requirements: Place a chiseled bookshelf and a redstone comparator next to it.

You need a chiseled bookshelf and a redstone comparator:

| Name                | Ingredients                                  | Crafting recipe |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Chiseled Bookshelf  | AnyPlanks+<br/>AnyWooden Slab                |                 |
| Redstone Comparator | Redstone Torch+<br/>Nether Quartz+<br/>Stone |                 |

Place the bookshelf down, and a comparator on any side of it. Placing comparator first and bookshelf second works as well. Note that comparator must be pointing away from the bookshelf (that is, the white triangle on top of it should be pointing away) as this enables the comparator to read a signal from the bookshelf. Once you placed the second block, you will get the advancement.

## 
Successfully trade with a Villager

Requirements: Trade with a villager or a wandering trader.

First, you need to find a villager or a wandering trader. Villagers naturally spawn in villages (except abandoned villages). If you can't find any village or if you are in a world where villages don't generate, alternatively you can cure a zombie villager (see the advancement Zombie Doctor in Minecraft tab, or paragraph about curing). Wandering traders spawn randomly near the player, once in every few days. 

Use the villager or wandering trader to see their trades. Depending on villager's profession, their GUI will look slightly different.

GUI of an exemplary villager
Wandering trader's GUI always looks similar, but trades may be different.

GUI of an exemplary wandering trader.
Next, you need to gather the item that villager/trader wants in a sufficient amount. Item wanted is shown on the left side of the trade, and item gives is shown on the right. If they want emeralds and you don't have any yet, you should probably switch to a different villager; you can also loot chests in the village if you find any, these have a chance to generate emeralds.

When you gathered items for the trade, put it in their trading slot. Then, pick up the item that they give you in return. This will grant you the advancement.

## Crafting a New Look
Craft a trimmed armor at a Smithing Table

Requirements: Trim a piece of armor at a smithing table using an armor trim smithing template.

First, you need a smithing template. It can only be found in rare generated structures, and a complete list can be found here; any armor trim template works for this advancement, but the netherite upgrade does not. Probably the easiest smithing template to find is coast armor trim, found relatively often in shipwrecks.

If you have only one trim, it is strongly recommended to duplicate the smithing template using seven diamonds and a corresponding material before trimming the armor, so you can apply this template to other armor pieces later, as the smithing template is consumed each time you trim an armor using it.

Next, you need a smithing table:

| Ingredients               | Crafting recipe |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Iron Ingot+<br/>AnyPlanks |                 |

Smithing tables can also naturally generate in villages and trail ruins.

Put your template, a piece of armor and a trimming material in proper slots.

| Ingredients                                        | Smithing recipe |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Any Armor Trim +Any Armor Piece +Any trim material | Upgrade Gear    |

Pulling the trimmed piece out of the smithing table will grant you the advancement.

Parent of: Smithing with Style

## Sticky Situation
Jump against a Honey Block to slow down your fall

Requirements: Jump into the side of a honey block so that it slows you down as you fall.

Craft a honey block from four honey bottles to (more info on how get those under Bee Our Guest advancement in Husbandry tab).

| Ingredients  | Crafting recipe |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Honey Bottle |                 |

You need for the honey block to "slow down your fall". Touching any side of this block while falling slows you down, but the game tracks this in a slightly unpredictable way, so multiple attempts may be required. A recommended way of obtaining this advancement is like so: place the honey block one block above the ground, all spaces around it should be empty. Stand right next to the honey block, so that your hitbox collides with it, and jump. Try a couple of times if this didn't trigger the advancement, you should eventually get it.

## 
Shoot a crossbow

Requirements: Load (fire up) a crossbow, then shoot with it.

Crossbows can be obtained in a few ways. You can craft a crossbow like so:

| Ingredients                                          | Crafting recipe |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Stick+<br/>Iron Ingot+<br/>String+<br/>Tripwire Hook |                 |

Crossbows can also drop from pillager and piglin, be bought from fletcher villagers, and found in chests in bastions and pillager outposts.

Besides the crossbow, you need at least one arrow in your inventory. Select the crossbow and hold use to load it. Release and press use again to fire it, and you will get this advancement. You don't need to hit anything with the shot arrow.

## Surge Protector
Protect a villager from an undesired shock without starting a fire

Requirements: Be within 30 blocks of a lightning strike that doesn't set any blocks on fire, while an unharmed villager is within or up to six blocks above a 30×30×30 volume centered on the lightning strike.

First, you need to find a villager (see What a Deal! above or "villager" page for more info). You should also get a lightning rod, which is crafted like so:

| Ingredients  | Crafting recipe |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Copper Ingot |                 |

A trident enchanted with Channeling is not necessary, but will be helpful (see A Throwaway Joke below for more info). 

In the setup, distance is crucial: the lightning rod needs to be far enough from the villager to not convert it into a witch, and close enough so that this advancement is triggered. The player also needs to be close to the lightning rod. To make the lightning not set any blocks on fire, the best option is to build a small pillar out of non-flammable blocks at least 4 blocks high, and put the lightning rod on top of it. Make sure the lightning rod has access to the sky. A simple setup can look like this: rod on top of a 4-high pillar, 6 empty spaces between the trapped villager and the pillar.

An exemplary setup
When this is done, you have to wait for a thunderstorm. Note that they are quite a rare event and can last for a very brief amount of time. When the thunder starts, any lightning that would strike in the area protected by the lightning rod (a sphere of 128 blocks) will divert into the rod instead. However, it is not certain that during a thunderstorm there will be such a lightning. If you want to guarantee getting this advancement on your first thunderstorm, prepare a trident with Channeling, and throw it at the rod as soon as a storm starts.

Once the lightning strikes the lightning rod, all players within a 30 block radius of the rod are granted the advancement.

This is one of only two advancements in the game that requires a thunderstorm: for the other one, see Very Very Frightening below.

## 
Free fall from the top of the world (build limit) to the bottom of the world and survive

Requirements: Fall from at least Y=319 to at most Y=-59 with a vertical distance of greater than 379 blocks and survive.

There are at least two methods to do this. The usual way, accessible even in early game, involves creating a tall pillar all the way to the build limit, and a shaft straight down to the bedrock layer right next to it.

Step 1: Shaft
Prepare a water bucket, 6 stacks of scaffolding (if you don't have easy access to bamboo, you can use 6 stacks of any other blocks), 1 trapdoor and a good pickaxe.

Go to the bottom of the Overworld. The highest layer with bedrock generates at Y=-60; you need to find a block of bedrock at least 2 layers deeper, at Y=-62, that can be accessed from above. Place a water bucket on top of that bedrock, so you can survive your jump. Write down X and Z coordinates of this block (use the debug screen to see those). If you are in a cold biome, you should place a light source next to the water, so it doesn't turn into ice.

Next, go to the surface on the corresponding coordinates, and dig 1×2 shaft all the way down to that block of bedrock: one column is for the jump, and the other is for going back up. If you find lava on the way down, it might be a good idea to choose a different spot for this advancement.

A very unlikely but possible scenario includes encountering an amethyst geode in your shaft. Remember that budding amethyst blocks grow amethyst clusters on their side, potentially blocking the drop, so make sure that no budding amethyst is present in the shaft.

Step 2: Pillar
Create a pillar of scaffolding in the second column. You can simply place the first scaffolding and keep clicking (use) on the side, until you see a message "Height limit for building is 319". This means that pillar has reached build limit.

Bottom chamber of the setup.
You can then walk inside of the scaffolding and hold jump to go all the way to build limit. Scaffolding is the best block for such a pillar, but you could also use ladders or just simply pillar up with normal blocks. Next, on top of your pillar, remove one scaffolding block and place four solid blocks and a trapdoor like so:

Top section of the setup.
Trapdoor should be directly above the target water source block at the bottom. Make sure it is at correct coordinates, as you will most likely die from falling if you miss the jump!

Step 3: The jump
Stand on top of the trapdoor and use it: you will start falling. Don't move! It takes about 8 seconds to reach bedrock from build limit. If you did everything correctly, you will hit the water placed in step 1 and get the advancement. You can then use your scaffolding pillar to get back out.

Endgame method
Alternatively, you can do this much faster if you have access to end-game items: elytra and totems of undying. Starting from any point on the surface, simply dig a shaft to bedrock: this can be even the highest layer of bedrock at Y = -60. Equip a totem in your off-hand. Next, point straight up (very important: you must point exactly 90 degrees upwards!). To verify you are pointing exactly up, see your coordinates—this is the last value in the row starting with "facing" in the debug screen. Enter flying mode with your elytra and, using fireworks, fly out of the shaft. Do not move your mouse! When you pass height 320, stop using fireworks. You will slow down and eventually fall back into the shaft. Again, it is very important that you don't move at all during the flight and fall. If you did everything correctly, you will hit bedrock at the bottom few seconds later, using up your totem and granting the advancement.

## Respecting the Remnants
Brush a Suspicious block to obtain a Pottery Sherd

Requirements: Brush suspicious sand or suspicious gravel and obtain a pottery sherd.

First, you need to make a brush:

| Ingredients                          | Crafting recipe |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Feather+<br/>Copper Ingot+<br/>Stick |                 |

Next, find any structure that has naturally-generated suspicious sand or suspicious gravel in it, and use a brush on that block. Repeat until one of these suspicious blocks drops a pottery sherd.

Despite being relatively simple to achieve, actual requirement for this advancement is rather complicated. You need to meet two criteria, in any order: 1) have a sherd in your inventory, and 2) start brushing a suspicious block that has its LootTable property set to one of the naturally-generating values (ocean_ruin_cold, desert_well, trail_ruins_rare, trail_ruins_common, desert_pyramid, ocean_ruin_warm). 

This means that you can't get the advancement from a block that was already touched by another player, even if it still has a sherd inside. It also means that you can get it from a block that doesn't have a sherd, if you were given the sherd by another player.

As soon as both criteria are met, you will get the advancement.

## Sneak 100
Sneak near a Sculk Sensor or Warden to prevent it from detecting you

Requirements: Sneak within 8 blocks from a sculk sensor, or 16 blocks from a warden.

It is recommended to do this with a sculk sensor rather than a warden. Sculk sensors, along with other sculk-related blocks, can be found in deep dark biomes, which generate deep underground. Simply sneak while being near one: this grants you the advancement and prevents the sensor from detecting you.

Be warned that deep dark is a very dangerous and scary place! If you want to know more about it, go to the "deep dark" page.

## Sweet Dreams
Sleep in a bed to change your respawn point

Requirements: Sleep in a bed.

Only perform this while in the Overworld. If you try to sleep in the Nether or the End, the bed will explode!

First, get a bed. It can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients                 | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| MatchingWool+<br/>AnyPlanks |                 |

Wool can be obtained either from killing or shearing a sheep, or crafted from 4 pieces of string. 

You can also find beds in villages and igloos, or buy them from shepherd villagers.

Place the bed down and sleep in it by using it. 4 criteria must be met to do that:

- there are no monsters near the bed;
- bed is not obstructed, meaning that two spaces above it are empty;
- you are within 2 blocks of the bed;
- it is eithernightor athunderstorm.

Sleeping in a bed will grant you the advancement and reset your spawn point, so that when you die, you will respawn next to your bed.

## Hero of the Village
Successfully defend a village from a raid

See also: Tutorials/Defeating a village raid

Requirements: Kill a raid captain, enter a village and complete a raid.

First, kill a raid captain (which will award the Voluntary Exile advancement) and get the Bad Omen effect. Then, go to a village: it can be either a naturally-generated village, or a structure that you made yourself. Even a single villager with either a claimed bed or a job site block counts. 

Once you entered the village, a bossbar labeled "Raid" will appear and your Bad Omen effect will disappear, indicating that a raid has started. There will be numerous amounts of waves of the raid based on the difficulty. If you kill a single captain, there are 3 waves in Easy, 5 in Normal, and 7 in Hard: killing more captains results in one extra wave appearing.

Mobs that will spawn during the raid are: pillagers, vindicators, and ravagers, which spawn on all difficulties; evokers, vexes and witches, which only spawn on Normal and Hard difficulties. Ridden ravagers spawn with a pillager on Normal and with pillagers, vindicators and evokers on Hard. Illusioners are unused.

Once you have completed the raid (every illager is dead and you directly killed at least one of them), you will get the "Hero of the Village" advancement. You will also get the status effect of the same name, Hero of the Village.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 100 experience.

This is a hidden advancement, meaning that it can only be viewed when the player has completed the advancement.

## 
Look at a ghast through a spyglass

Requirements: Use a spyglass while aiming at a ghast.

The second of spyglass advancements (for the first one, see Is It a Bird?) requires you to look through it at a ghast. This should be easy, as ghasts are common in the Nether and hard to miss because of their size.

| Ingredients                      | Crafting recipe |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Amethyst Shard+<br/>Copper Ingot |                 |

Once you zoom in on the ghast, you will be granted the advancement. 

Parent of: Is it a Plane?

## A Throwaway Joke
Throw a trident at something. Note: Throwing away your only weapon is not a good idea.

Requirements: Throw a trident at any mob.

First, you need a trident. They drop exclusively from drowned. 

Drowned can be found around ocean ruins or underwater in light level 0 in rivers, aquifers in the dripstone caves and all ocean biomes. 6.25% of drowned (on average 1 out of 16) spawn with a trident, and there is a 8.5% chance for the drowned to drop its trident, if it was killed by a player. This chance can be increased with Looting, up to 11.5% with level III. A shield can be helpful fighting drowned underwater, as their tridents deal massive damage.

Once you have obtained the trident, you then have to throw it at any mob (a melee attack with the trident will not work). Hold use for about 2 seconds and release it, aiming at your target mob. Once the thrown trident has hit a mob, you will be rewarded the advancement.

Note that the trident's durability will be reduced by 1 in the process. Repairing the trident with Mending before you throw it is not required, but recommended, as tridents are very hard to get and relatively easy to break.

Parent of: Very Very Frightening

## It Spreads
Kill a mob near a Sculk Catalyst

Requirements: Kill a mob that drops experience within 8 blocks of a sculk catalyst.

First, you need a sculk catalyst. These spawn in deep dark biome, just like sculk sensors (see Sneak 100). However, no mobs (except for wardens) can spawn in this biome; some mobs spawned in nearby biomes may wander to the catalyst, but that creates a risk of attracting a warden. You can bring a bucket of fish to the catalyst and kill the fish; it should count. Alternatively you can pick up the catalyst and bring it somewhere else. To do that, you need to mine the catalyst with any tool that has Silk Touch enchantment.

Then, get out of deep dark and place the catalyst on the surface. You need to kill any mob that drops experience (except the ender dragon) within 8 blocks of the catalyst: it might be a hostile monster like zombie, or a passive mob like sheep. Mobs that will not work include baby animals, allays, iron golems, snow golems, villagers, wandering traders, and bats.

Once the mob dies, you will be granted the advancement, and some sculk will appear near the catalyst, replacing blocks in the ground.

## Take Aim
Shoot something with an arrow

Requirements: Hit any mob with a shot arrow.

Get a bow or a crossbow and at least one arrow. You can either craft them, or get a bow and arrows by killing skeletons, or get the crossbow from killing pillagers or piglins.

| Name     | Ingredients                                          | Crafting recipe |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Bow      | Stick+<br/>String                                    |                 |
| Crossbow | Stick+<br/>Iron Ingot+<br/>String+<br/>Tripwire Hook |                 |
| Arrow    | Flint+<br/>Stick+<br/>Feather                        | 4               |

Once you have those, shoot any mob to get the advancement: use the bow to charge it, aim at a mob, and release it. With the crossbow, hold use to load it, then release and press use again to fire it. One arrow will be consumed in the process, unless you have Infinity on your bow.

Once the arrow hits a mob, you will get the advancement.

Parent of: Sniper Duel | Bullseye

## Monsters Hunted
Kill one of every hostile monster

Requirements: Kill every hostile mob at least once.

Kill every type of hostile mob at least once. Killing a type of hostile mob in your current world will be saved in the progress bar of this advancement. The 36‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21] mobs you will need to kill include: 

- Blaze
- Bogged‌[upcoming]
- Breeze‌[upcoming]
- Cave Spider
- Creeper
- Drowned
- Elder Guardian
- Ender Dragon
- Enderman
- Endermite
- Evoker
- Ghast
- Guardian
- Hoglin
- Husk
- Magma Cube
- Phantom
- Piglin
- Piglin Brute
- Pillager
- Ravager
- Shulker
- Silverfish
- Skeleton
- Slime
- Spider
- Stray
- Vex
- Vindicator
- Witch
- Wither
- Wither Skeleton
- Zoglin
- Zombie
- Zombified Piglin
- Zombie Villager

The hardest mobs to kill for this challenge advancement are the bosses: ender dragon and wither. For tutorials on how to deal with them, see Tutorials/Defeating the ender dragon and Tutorials/Defeating the wither. Note that killing a warden is not required.

Other harder mobs include: elder guardians (found in ocean monuments), ravagers (spawn only during raids), evokers and vindicators (spawn only in woodland mansions and during raids), piglin brutes (found in bastions) and zoglins (you need to get a hoglin into the Overworld, this is made even harder by their fear of nether portals). All of these are somewhat rare and can deal lots of damage, so prepare before fighting them. More info about each of those is on their own pages, and also on the Tutorials/Combat page.

The player can track their progress by going to the "Mobs" section in their statistics. All mobs that are killed by the player (or have killed the player) at least once will be shown on the page.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 100 experience.

## Postmortal
Use a Totem of Undying to cheat death

Requirements: Take fatal damage while holding a Totem of Undying.

You need a totem of undying. These are dropped from evokers, which spawn only in woodland mansions or during a raid. Then, if you take fatal damage while holding the totem of undying in either hand (switch between hands by pressing F, better for dual wielding), you will not actually die; instead, you will use up your totem. Your health will regenerate (from Absorption and you gaining 1) and you will get the advancement. Any source of damage counts except for void damage, because totems can't save you from dying in the void.

The status effects you will get from the totem of undying are: 45 seconds of Regeneration II, 40 seconds of Fire Resistance, and 5 seconds of Absorption II. The totem of undying will remove all of your current status effects and apply these instead.

## Hired Help
Summon an Iron Golem to help defend a village

Requirements: Use 4 blocks of iron and 1 carved pumpkin to spawn an iron golem.

Summon an iron golem; summoning it in a village is not necessary. Gather 36 iron ingots and a carved pumpkin. Use the ingots to make 4 iron blocks, and place them in a "T" shape on the ground. Place the carved pumpkin on top of the top middle block. Blocks above and below the "arms" must be air.

|  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

This should spawn an iron golem, granting you the advancement. Iron golems will kill any nearby monsters except for creepers. Iron golems are considered neutral mobs when naturally generated (meaning they will attack you if provoked), but if a player summoned the iron golem, they will become passive toward the player.

## Star Trader
Trade with a Villager at the build height limit

Requirements: Stand on at least Y=319 and trade with a villager or wandering trader.

The usual way of completing this advancement requires the player to transport a villager to the build limit of 319, and then trade with it. The villager can be transported upward in a variety of ways. One of them is to use a vertical flying machine, with the benefit that a tower doesn't need to be constructed. The specific method is described in this video.

First, trap the villager in a boat. Dig a hole next to it, 5 blocks deep, 4 blocks long and 3 wide. Inside of that space, build a flying machine according to the screenshot: you need 2 sticky pistons, 2 observers, 2 slime blocks and 1 torch. Make sure that observers and sticky pistons are pointing in correct directions.

Completed machine with a villager next to it
Once the flying machine is finished, you need a water bucket, some blocks to make a platform up in the sky, and also something to trade with the villager (any trade works). If it's unemployed, a job site block for will also be needed: stonecutter or cartography table are recommended as they are easy to get and guarantee buying emeralds on the lowest level. In that case, you will obviously also need some emeralds.

Then get into the boat, move it on top of the machine and pour water next to it—below the level that the boat is on. This both will serve as a landing pad and flush the torch, activating your machine. Once the flying machine is activated, it will fly upward, carrying you and the villager with it. It takes about 2 minutes to fly from sea level to build limit. Once the machine reaches the build limit, it automatically stops. Now, you have to be very careful: exit the boat and perform the trade. Once that's done, you will receive the advancement.

To get down safely, you can either activate the flying machine to make it go downward (place a block next to the top observer), or simply disassemble the flying machine, and fall down into the water you placed below.

## Smithing with Style
Apply these smithing templates at least once: Spire, Snout, Rib, Ward, Silence, Vex, Tide, Wayfinder

Requirements: Apply all smithing templates listed above at least once.

As with the parent advancement, you need a smithing table. Next, you have to find eight specific armor trim smithing templates. Six of them can be obtained from chests in various structures, one comes from killing elder guardians, and one can be brushed from suspicious gravel.

| Smithing template    | Obtained from                            | Chance |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|--------|
| Spire Armor Trim     | End citychest                            | 6.7%   |
| Snout Armor Trim     | Bastion remnantchest                     | 8.3%   |
| Rib Armor Trim       | Nether fortresschest                     | 6.7%   |
| Ward Armor Trim      | Ancient citychest                        | 5%     |
| Silence Armor Trim   | Ancient citychest                        | 1.2%   |
| Vex Armor Trim       | Woodland mansiongeneric chest            | 50%    |
| Tide Armor Trim      | Killing anelder guardian                 | 20%    |
| Wayfinder Armor Trim | Brushing suspicious gravel intrail ruins | 8.3%   |

It is recommended to duplicate each of these before applying them on armor, as that uses up the template.

When you have all eight trims, apply one of each type to an armor piece in your smithing table. When the 8th one is applied, you will get the advancement.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 150 experience.

Kill two Phantoms with a piercing arrow

Requirements: Shoot a crossbow with the enchantment Piercing at two phantoms with one arrow.

You need to kill two phantoms with one crossbow shot. To achieve that, the crossbow must be enchanted with any level of Piercing.

Phantoms spawn after three in-game days wherein the player does not sleep (unless the game rule doInsomnia is set to false). They have 20 × 10 health, and thus cannot be killed with just one crossbow shot: it deals 7 of damage at minimum, 9 at average, and 11 × 5.5 at maximum, therefore requiring at least two shots. You can try damaging phantoms first with a melee weapon or arrow shots, but it is very hard to keep track of which phantom was damaged, if a whole group is swooping at you. It is also very hard to line them up for one shot. To make this easier, use boats.

Step 1: Setup
Using this method requires a crossbow with at least Piercing III. Also, don't wear any armor with Thorns during the task. 

Place two boats on top of 2-block high pillars, close to each other, preferably in a flat, open biome rich with animals, like plains. Lure animals into the boats and place them inside as passengers, one in each boat. Kill any other nearby animals, so that nothing else enters these boats. Stay in the area and wait for the night.

Two boats prepared
Step 2: Phantoms
At night, if you haven't slept for three days, phantoms will spawn and swoop down at you. Stand near the boats, until a phantom gets stuck in each one as its second passenger. Kill any other phantoms that spawned. Now, press F3+B to see hitboxes of mobs: you can easily control how much health each phantom has by hitting its hitbox.

Phantom's hitbox sticks out of the boat's hitbox
Hit each phantom with a stone axe twice, without criticals or strength effect (make sure to not hit the boat's hitbox, as it will break the boat and let phantom free!). This reduces their health from 20 × 10 to 2. Now kill the animal in front seat of each boat. After that, you can see phantom's hitbox is entirely within boat's hitbox, thus being nearly impossible to hit; this is why you needed these front-seat passengers.

Step 3: The shot
Place an additional block next to two pillars for you to stand on (here it is represented by a cobblestone block):

Setup ready for the shot
Stand on that block and sneak. You are now lined up perfectly for the shot. Load up your crossbow (don't do that pointing at a boat, as you will enter it...), aim at the phantom and shoot. Arrow will pierce through both phantoms and both boats, killing all 4 entities and granting you the advancement.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 65 experience.

## 
Give a Pillager a taste of their own medicine

Requirements: Kill a pillager using a crossbow.

Use a crossbow to kill a pillager. This can be any crossbow, either crafted, dropped by mobs, bought or found in chests (see Ol'Betsy).

After you have obtained a crossbow, find a pillager (usually found frequently in pillager outposts and patrols), and kill it using your crossbow. You will need at least 3 arrows to do this. Alternatively, attack the pillager with melee attacks until it is on low health, and finish it off with a crossbow shot. You will then be awarded the advancement.

## Arbalistic
Kill five unique mobs with one crossbow shot

Requirements: Use a crossbow enchanted with Piercing IV to kill any 5 different mobs in one shot.

Kill five different mobs (for the purpose of this advancement, armor stand counts as a mob!) in one shot with a crossbow enchanted with Piercing IV, which allows arrows to hit five entities. Recommended mobs for this method are: pig, sheep, cow, villager and an armor stand. All of these have relatively large hitboxes, meaning they are hard to miss (unlike chickens or rabbits), but they still fit in a 1×1 area (unlike horses or donkeys). 

First, prepare a crossbow with Piercing IV (lower level will not work!) and an extended splash potion of Poison. Then look for a village in a plains biome: all needed mobs should be in proximity. Trap the villager first, as it is the hardest to move around. Any method works, as long as the villager ends in an 1×1 area, where it can't escape from. Drop the armor stand into the same spot, and lure a cow, a sheep (both are attracted to wheat) and a pig (attracted to carrots, potatoes or beetroots) from nearby plains. You can also use leads to make this easier.

Mobs prepared for a shot
Now, build a 4-high pillar next to the hole. Sneak and lean from its edge. Then, throw the potion of Poison at the mobs. This will reduce their health down to 1, but not fully kill them, which allows you to finish them off with the crossbow shot. You may want to bring a milk bucket, just in case you poison yourself.

After Poison wears off, load up your crossbow and shoot straight down at the mobs. If you did everything correctly, all five mobs will be killed with this shot, and you will get the advancement.

This is a hidden advancement, meaning that it can only be viewed when the player has completed the advancement.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 85 experience.

## Careful restoration
Make a Decorated Pot out of 4 Pottery Sherds

Requirements: Craft a decorated pot using 4 pottery sherds.

Craft a decorated pot using only pottery sherds: no bricks are allowed in this recipe. You can use any 4 pottery sherds, different or the same.

Sherds have a chance to be brushed from any naturally-generated suspicious sand or suspicious gravel, which are found in desert temples, desert wells, ocean ruins and trail ruins. The best places to look for sherds are probably desert temples, as they have 6-8 blocks of suspicious sand and, on average, 50% of them contain sherds.

Once you pull a decorated pot out of the crafting table, you will be rewarded the advancement.

## Adventuring Time
Discover every biome

Requirements: Visit all biomes in the Overworld.

This is achieved by setting foot in all 53 standard biomes in the Overworld (the Nether and the End are excluded). The biomes you need to visit are:

- Badlands
- Bamboo Jungle
- Beach
- Birch Forest
- Cherry Grove
- Cold Ocean
- Dark Forest
- Deep Cold Ocean
- Deep Dark
- Deep Frozen Ocean
- Deep Lukewarm Ocean
- Deep Ocean
- Desert
- Dripstone Caves
- Eroded Badlands
- Flower Forest
- Forest
- Frozen Ocean
- Frozen Peaks
- Frozen River
- Grove
- Ice Spikes
- Jagged Peaks
- Jungle
- Lukewarm Ocean
- Lush Caves
- Mangrove Swamp
- Meadow
- Mushroom Fields
- Ocean
- Old Growth Birch Forest
- Old Growth Pine Taiga
- Old Growth Spruce Taiga

- Stony Peaks
- Stony Shore
- Sunflower Plains
- Swamp
- Taiga
- Warm Ocean
- Windswept Forest
- Windswept Gravelly Hills
- Windswept Hills
- Windswept Savanna
- Wooded Badlands

Once you have been in every biome, you will be rewarded the advancement.

The player can check their progress by going to the Adventure tab and hover their cursor over the advancement. A progress bar will show how many of the 53 biomes they have visited. However, it does not show which of the biomes have been visited. You can create a notepad document and tick off biomes as you visit them, however there is a better method.

For a singleplayer world, a reliable way to check for which biomes have been visited is to read the .JSON file that stores the advancements. It involves the following steps:  

- Go to the.minecraftfolder >>saves>> (name of the world) >>advancements.
- Open the only available .JSON file in the folder with a text editor (e.g. Notepad).
- Find the entry that saysminecraft:adventure/adventuring_time.
- See which biomes are listed under the entry.

The file keeps a record of which biomes the player has visited, as well as the exact time that the player visited them for the first time. By reading this file, the player can learn of which biomes they need to visit in order to complete this advancement.

For a multiplayer server, you can't directly check the corresponding server's file, but you can use a client-side mod called AdvancementInfo, that lets you check which biomes you visited. It can be downloaded from this page.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 500 experience.

## Sound of Music
Make the Meadows come alive with the sound of music from a Jukebox

Requirements: Play a music disc in a jukebox located in a meadow biome.

First, craft a jukebox:

| Ingredients            | Crafting recipe |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| AnyPlanks+<br/>Diamond |                 |

Then, obtain any music disc. There are sixteen different discs. Twelve of them can be dropped by creepers when killed by a skeleton or a stray, other four can be found only as loot in certain generated structures: 

- "Pigstep" can be found inbastionchests,
- "otherside" generates in chests indungeons,strongholdsandancient cities,
- "5" can be crafted fromdisc fragments, found in chests in ancient cities,
- "Relic" can bebrushedfromsuspicious gravelintrail ruins.

After you get a music disc, find a meadow biome. Place your jukebox in the meadow and play your music disc in it by using the disc on the jukebox. You will then get the advancement.

## Light as a Rabbit
Walk on Powder Snow...without sinking in it

Requirement: Walk on powder snow using leather boots

You need a pair of leather boots. They can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Leather     |                 |

You can also rarely obtain a pair of leather boots by killing a zombie, husk, stray or skeleton that was wearing them, trading with villagers, fishing or by finding them in village or shipwreck chests.

Then, either obtain or locate powder snow. It spawns naturally in groves and snowy slopes on the sides of mountains. It can be distinguished from regular snow block by its texture; also, snow layers don't accumulate on top of powder snow, which helps to differentiate between snow variants. 

You can also obtain powder snow by placing a cauldron in a snowy biome. Make sure it has exposure to the sky, and then wait for it to snow, as it will fill with powder snow during snowy weather. Note, however, that the cauldron can take a really long time to fill up. Once the cauldron is full, you can use a bucket to remove the powder snow from the cauldron and place it elsewhere.

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Iron Ingot  |                 |

Once you have found or placed the powder snow, equip your leather boots and stand on top of it. You will not sink into the powder snow, and you will get the advancement.

## 
Look at the Ender Dragon through a spyglass

Requirements: Zoom in on the ender dragon while holding a spyglass.

The third of spyglass advancements (see Is It a Bird? and Is It a Balloon?) requires you to look through it at the ender dragon. This can be either the original dragon or a respawned one. Other advancements related to the dragon, defeating and respawning it are explained in this part of advancement tutorial.

| Ingredients                      | Crafting recipe |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Amethyst Shard+<br/>Copper Ingot |                 |

Once you zoom in on the dragon, you will be granted the advancement.

## Very Very Frightening
Strike a Villager with lightning

Requirements: Hit a villager with lightning created by a trident with the Channeling enchantment.

First, you need a trident enchanted with Channeling. For more information on how to get the trident, see A Throwaway Joke. Next, find a villager and trap it. The villager can't have any blocks above its head, or, in other words, it must have a direct sky access. Also, the villager can't touch water, otherwise lightning will not strike it.

Now you need to wait for a thunderstorm. Note that they are quite a rare event and can last for a very brief amount of time. When the thunder starts, throw your trident at the villager: a lightning will strike it and you will get the advancement.

## Sniper Duel
Kill a Skeleton from at least 50 meters away

Requirements: Be at least 50 blocks away from a skeleton and kill it with a projectile.

Kill a skeleton with a projectile that is shot from at least 50 blocks away horizontally. The best way to do this is to first trap a skeleton in a smallest possible area using fences, so that you don't have to deal with a moving target. Also, make sure that it is nighttime so that the skeleton will not burn in the daytime. Alternatively, if the skeleton has a helmet on or a block above its head, it will not burn in the daylight; however, its helmet will eventually break from the daylight. To ensure that the skeleton doesn't despawn, put a name tag on it.

Then back away at least 50 blocks from the skeleton, horizontally—you can use the debug screen to see your coordinates in the world. From that point shoot at about a 45 degree angle toward the skeleton. You can also reduce your FOV to aim better. It may take many tries to shoot correctly. You will get the advancement once the skeleton is killed by the projectile.

To weaken the skeleton and kill it in one hit with your projectile, you can hit it with another weapon for a certain number of times, until you can hit the skeleton with the projectile in one hit. You will get the advancement as long as when the skeleton is killed and it was hit by your arrow at last. If you have an iron sword, diamond sword, netherite sword, or any type of axe (except netherite), you can hit the skeleton twice with that weapon before shooting the skeleton with a fully charged arrow in one hit. If you have a wooden, stone, or gold sword, hit the skeleton three times with that weapon before shooting the skeleton. A bow enchanted with Power IV or V can kill a full health skeleton in one hit. 

Although arrows are the easiest to get, any projectile can be used for this advancement: for example, tridents work as well, and it is a bit easier to aim with them.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 50 experience.

## Bullseye
Hit the bullseye of a Target block from at least 30 meters away

Requirements: Be at least 30 meters away from a target block, when it gets hit in the exact center with a projectile shot by you

First, get a target. It can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients                 | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| Redstone Dust+<br/>Hay Bale |                 |

Targets can also naturally generate in ancient cities.

Place the target down. Now, get a bow or a crossbow and some arrows. For an "intended" method of completing the advancement, you need to shoot on the bullseye (center) of the target from at least 30 blocks away horizontally. Changing the FOV value to 30 may be useful here, as well as using the debug screen to see your coordinates.

To acknowledge where the arrow lands and how close you were, you can place 15 redstone dust in a line starting from the target with redstone lamps below. The more lamps light up, the more accurate your hit was. If you shot farther away from the bullseye, not as many lamps will light. If all 15 lamps light, you have hit the bullseye. If you didn't get the advancement, you were too close; when you hit the bullseye from at least 30 blocks away horizontally, you will be rewarded the advancement.

Because of how inaccurate the bow is, this method can take a really long time. An easier way to complete the advancement is to place a trapdoor on top of the target block and build a 5-block high stairs above it. Measure 35 meters from the target and mark it with a block like cobblestone. Then, climb up the stairs and shoot few arrows directly down, to the middle of the trapdoor; from such short distance you will have a much better accuracy.

Setup ready for getting the advancement
Now you have to be quick, as these arrows will disappear 60 seconds after being shot. Go back to the spot marked with cobblestone and shoot the target. You just have to hit it, it does not need to be a precise shot. This triggers a redstone signal, which opens the trapdoor, and all arrows you shot earlier fall directly on the bullseye, granting you the advancement.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 50 experience.
