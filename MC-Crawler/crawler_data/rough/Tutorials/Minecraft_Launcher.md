## Features
The initial login screen
On the initial login screen, users must log in with a pre-existing Microsoft account, otherwise they can create a new one by clicking the link. Subsequent logins can be done in the "Settings" tab.

On the left side, a "News" tab, a tab for each game, and the Minecraft Launcher "Settings" tab can be seen.

The top left corner of the Minecraft Launcher contains the user's Xbox gamertag for the currently active account (which might differ from their Minecraft: Java Edition username)[2]. By clicking on it, users can manage or log out of their active account, and see a "Help" page with various links to helpful resources.

## Minecraft: Java Edition
The main "Play" section allows the user to download (if needed) and launch Minecraft: Java Edition with the "Play" button, and also includes an installation selection on the left (which sorts installations by last played), the user's Java Edition username on the right, and a list of the latest news for the game from minecraft.net below. 

- One can launch multiple instances of the game by pressing the "Play" button while the game is running.
- If the device is not connected to the internet, the game can be run in offline mode, but only if the game has been initially downloaded.
- If the user isn't logged into an account that has purchased the game, the "Play" button appears as a "Play demo" button that downloads and launches thedemo versionof the game.

There is also a "Patch notes" section where the patch notes of the game's update can be seen, including the snapshots (if enabled).

### Installations


Creating a new installation.
In the "Installations" section, custom installations can be created and edited. There are buttons to sort and search installations, as well as checkboxes to enable installations with "Releases", "Snapshot", and "Modded" versions of the game. Installations are stored in launcher_profiles.json (or launcher_profiles_microsoft_store.json when using the new Minecraft Launcher for Windows) in the game's directory (.minecraft).

By default, there are installations for the "Latest release" and for "Latest snapshot" (if enabled), both of which the game versions cannot be changed. A new installation can be created by clicking the "New installation" button and an existing installation can be edited by clicking on it. There is a "Play" button that launches the selected installation and a folder icon that takes to the installation's game directory. The ellipses button contains the options to edit, duplicate, or delete an installation.

On the create/edit installation page, the following can be changed:

- Icon, by selecting one of the default ones or adding a custom one. Custom icons must be a.pngand 128×128 pixels in size.
- Name, by default called "<unnamed installation>".
- Version, which includes access to older releases and snapshots (if enabled).
- Game directory, the location of where the game files are saved, the default being.minecraft. The location can be typed in or selected using the "Browse" button.
- Resolution, which changes the game's windows size. It has a list of resolutions, or a custom one can be typed in.
- Java executable, by default uses the bundled java runtime.
- JVM arguments, such as heap size.

Before, it was possible for the users to manually set a logging configuration (see Debugging on wiki.vg for more info), however this doesn't seem to work anymore.[3]

A specific game version's server jar can also be downloaded by selecting the version in the list and pressing the "Server" button next to it.

### Backward compatibility
Selecting older versions in the create new installation screen.
The Minecraft Launcher has the ability to play most older releases of the game (and older snapshots, if enabled) by default, but also some older versions prior to Release 1.0. In order to see these versions in the installations section, the player must enable "Show historical versions of Java Edition" in the Minecraft Launcher settings tab. Because these versions are outdated and unsupported, they may contain bugs and errors that are not present in newer versions. It is recommended to run old versions of the game in a separate directory and backup worlds to avoid save corruption or other problems.[4]

Once historical versions are enabled, the following can be accessed:

- Mostbetaversions.
- Mostalphaversions.
- Oneinfdevversion.
- Fourclassicversions.
- Fivepre-classicversions.[5]

Some issues with these older versions include:

- Some sounds are wrong;bows,doors, andexplosionsuse their sounds fromRC1, even in versions released prior to it. In versions beforeAlpha v1.1.2_01, sounds do not work at all.
- Skinsare missing in versions prior to1.7, as earlier versions used a different skin server, which has since been shut down.Capesmay still work, however.[needs testing]
- InAlpha v1.0.15and fromAlpha v1.2.0toAlpha v1.2.6, theMinecraft Launcherdoes not set the player's name properly, resulting in everyone using default names: "Player" followed by a random 3-digit number. This makes multiplayer difficult to play, as a player's location and inventory is reset every time they relaunch their client.

- InAlpha v1.2.5and Alpha v1.2.6 specifically, players are always named "Player524". Playing multiplayer in these versions is impossible, as joining a server kicks off other players with the same name.

- As a side effect of the above, and as a result of old authentication servers being shut down, online mode no longer works in versions beforeBeta 1.8.

### Realms
In the "Realms" section, the user can buy, play, and manage a Minecraft Realm. They can choose their Installation of choice before launching a realm.

### Skins
The skins section
In the "Skins" section, the user can view and change their in-game skin. By default, the skin is either Steve, Alex, Noor, Sunny, Ari, Zuri, Makena, Kai, or Efe.

In the skins library, skin can be applied by clicking "Use". The skin can also be edited, duplicated, chosen to be either wide or slim, or delete by clicking the ellipsis button. By default, the library contains the default Steve, Alex, Noor, Sunny, Ari, Zuri, Makena, Kai, and Efe skins, which can be duplicated or applied, but not removed. Custom skins can also be uploaded by clicking the "New skin" button.

Visiting this section without purchasing the game displays a button that redirects to the Minecraft: Java Edition store page.

## Minecraft for Windows
The main "Play" section allows the user to download (if needed) and launch Minecraft for Windows (Bedrock Edition) with the "Play" button, and also includes an installation selection on the left to choose between the latest release or the latest Preview, it also includes the user's Xbox Gamertag on the right, and a list of the latest news for the game from minecraft.net below.

- If the device is not connected to the internet, the game can be run in offline mode, but only if the game has been initially downloaded.
- If the user is on an unsupported device, a warning appears with a link to a website with supported devices.
- If the user isn't logged into an account that has purchased the game, the "Play" button appears as a "Play demo" button that links the player to Microsoft Store to download and launch thedemo versionof the game.

There is a "Realms" tab to buy, play, and manage a Minecraft Realm, an "FAQ" section with frequently asked questions and answers about the Minecraft Launcher and Minecraft for Windows (Bedrock Edition), an "Installation" section to repair or uninstall the game, and a "Patch notes" section where the patch notes of the game's updates can be seen (not including beta versions).

## Command line usage



Important Note 
On Windows, this works only on the old Unified Minecraft Launcher and NOT the Microsoft Store version.



  

This section is missing information about the default host of the proxy (if available) and the --nativeLauncherVersion flag. 
Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page.



The Minecraft Launcher can be invoked using the command line by typing %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Minecraft Launcher\MinecraftLauncher.exe in Windows, minecraft-launcher in Linux or /Applications/Minecraft.app/Contents/MacOS/launcher in Mac.
The Help Message when using MinecraftLauncher.exe --help
As of version 2.2.25xx, the Minecraft Launcher has these command-line options available for Minecraft: Java Edition:

- --demo- This launches the demo version of the game, much like if the game hasn't been purchased yet.
- -h, --help- This option displays a help message on how to run it in the command line.
- --clean– This option deletes the "game" and "runtime" folders, including their contents, from the working directory.
- --launcherui- This option presents the login screen.
- -w, --workDir– This option, followed by a path (relative or absolute), changes the location (and/or name) of the.minecraftfolder.
	- Can be used to create a portable installation of the game. For example,--workDir(or--workDir=.) can be used to make theMinecraft Launcheruse the current directory (no matter what the current folder is called).
- --nativeLauncherVersion- .
- --tmpDir– This option, followed by a path (relative or absolute), changes the location (and/or name) of thetmpfolder.
- -l, --lockDir- This option, followed by a path, restricts the installation directory to a specified folder.
- --winTen– This option adds support for Windows 10. Since theMinecraft Launchernow supports Windows 10 fully, this option is unnecessary and seems to have no effect.
- --proxyHost- This option changes where the host of the proxy is.
- --proxyPort- This option changes the default port from80to a custom one.
- --disableGPU- This disables GPU acceleration in theMinecraft Launcher, which might fix issues when playing minecraft.
- --debugGPU- This opens up a new window showing debug information, like "Graphic Feature Stats", which shows if Hardware acceleration is enabled on certain features, and an option to copy the content to the clipboard. These might be useful for troubleshooting purposes.


## Uninstalling the old Minecraft Unified Launcher
Source: "Uninstalling the Old Minecraft Unified Launcher" – Minecraft Help Center.

This applies only to players using Windows 10 or newer. Older versions of Windows are not able to use the new Minecraft Launcher for Windows. With the addition of a new launcher, you can uninstall the old launcher to remove any confusion between the two. For clarity, the new launcher is referred to as the "Minecraft Launcher for Windows" and the old launcher as the "Minecraft Unified Launcher". 

How to uninstall the Minecraft Unified Launcher (old launcher):

1. Click the start menu in Windows (windows icon in the bottom left).
2. Type in "Add or remove programs" and click the top entry.
3. Search for "Minecraft Launcher". The launcher to uninstall displaysMojangunderneath the title "Minecraft Launcher".
4. Click the three dots shown to the left of the "Minecraft Launcher" title and select "Uninstall".

Now only one launcher should be installed. Run the Minecraft Launcher for Windows to ensure it still works; if it doesn't, reinstall using Microsoft Store.

Launcher or game mods may need to be migrated or re-installed to the new Minecraft Launcher for Windows installation location before uninstalling the old launcher. Check with the mod developer for more detail.
