## 
Ferns have little use in the game. They can be composted, but they are not the most efficient item. However, they can be used for decoration. You can plant ferns and large ferns in plant pots or on grass to make a good aesthetic for a rustic or taiga-style build.

## Manual farming
If you use bone meal on a fern, it grows in height, and it can then be mined with shears. The process can then be repeated.

## AFK farming
You can automate the system with a dispenser with bone meal and a minecart with hopper system to pick up the ferns. You can make a larger farm with multiple ferns getting bone meal, which requires a minecart system to move the player around. A hopper clock can be used to dispense shears after the previous set of shears is broken.
