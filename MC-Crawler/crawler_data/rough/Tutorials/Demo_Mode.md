# Demo Mode
The Demo Mode is a demo of Minecraft for users who have not purchased the game yet and would like to try it out first without purchasing it.

The demo version of Java Edition can be played free of charge by logging into the Minecraft Launcher with a Microsoft or Mojang Studios account that hasn't purchased the game yet, designed to replace the functionality of the outdated PC Gamer Demo. This demo version consists of a single seed that can be played for up to 5 in-game days (1 hour and 40 minutes total).

## Functionality
The demo mode can be played by all players regardless of whether they have yet purchased the game. Demo Mode functionally serves to allow the players to try out the game before deciding to buy Minecraft. It allows players to play on a single world for a 100-minute (5 in-game days) period before the map is locked and required to be reset.

Custom skins can be applied in Bedrock Edition, and it is possible to install resource packs and modifications on the Java Edition demo.

While demo mode does not expire, it comes with certain restrictions as its sole purpose is to allow new players to try out Minecraft.

## Restrictions
### Java Edition
The following restrictions apply when playing the game in demo mode:

- The demo map is preset and always generates with the same seed:-343522682, corresponding to the text seedNorth Carolina.
	- This means that the playerspawn,seed, andgenerated structuresare always the same.
- The game is locked to Survival mode andcommandsare disabled by default.
	- Commands can be enabled and other game modes can be made accessible by using Open to LAN.
- Multiplayer servers are inaccessible, althoughLANmultiplayer is allowed, with the limitation that only 1 demo account is allowed on a server (this is because the defaultMinecraftname ('Player') cannot be changed).
- The game time is limited to five in-game days (1 hour and 40 minutes real-time or 100 minutes total). After the time runs out, players can still navigate through the world, but their interactions with it are limited. Resetting the demo world also resets the demo timer.
	- Changing the in-game time forcibly with commands or external programs such as an NBT editor can reset the timer.
	- It is possible to gain (almost) unlimited time in the demo by changing the in-game time to extreme negative values (past the minimum 64-bit integer limit, which is -9223372036854655508). However, the number causes several problems such as zombies and creepers behaving passively to players.
		- The player can still attack/kill mobs and take damage. Their hunger, saturation, health, and drowning bars work as normal, but they cannot eat anything.
		- Breaking any block leads to the block being instantly restored, and placing any block leads to the block being deleted.
		- The player can still removeboats, but they cannot place them.
		- The player can still pick up dropped items.
- "Demo" is displayed in the version notation on thetitle screen.
