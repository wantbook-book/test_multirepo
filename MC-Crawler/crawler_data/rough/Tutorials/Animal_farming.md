# Tutorials/Animal farming
Players may find themselves in need of cooked meats, leathers, feathers, wool, eggs, rabbit hides or rabbit's foots in large quantities, or need to gain experience from animals. A quick hunt across a large area may temporarily provide a player with these. However, due to slow passive mob spawning mechanics in Minecraft, mobs may not spawn quick or many enough to meet these demands in smallest amount of effort and time. This may force players to hunt elsewhere in further new chunks.

To prevent this issue, players can herd a small supply of livestock, breeding them to create new livestock, and then kill a portion of the adults whenever the player needs more meats and other drops. Manual slaughter farms also provide a modest amount of experience from breeding and killing animals, but this should not be the main focus of an animal farm. For players interested in farming experience quickly for enchanting or other needs, they should focus on hostile mob farms.

This tutorial page aims to explain some methods used to manually, semi-automatically, and automatically farm cows, sheeps, pigs and chickens (see egg farming).

## Basic farming
1. Round up at least two animals of the same kind into a pen.Fencesare useful, but you can also dig a hole 2 blocks deep so that the animals cannot jump out.
	- You can make the hole as wide as you want to make it easier for them to fall into. In Java Edition, players should be careful ofentity crammingwhere mobs suffocate to death. This mechanic can be exploited to create farms,like a cow crusher.
	- Rabbitscan jump off a two-block deep gap, but they can't if the hole is at least three deep.
2. Breedthem until you have a reasonable number.
3. Kill some adults to obtain their resources. Do not kill all of them, as it is harder to breed animals again. The less left, the harder it is for them to rebound back to their original numbers.

To lead animals around, you need to wield the same food that you can breed them with or a lead. Leads can be obtained by killing trader llamas or by crafting them, using string and slimeballs. 

- Wheatattractscows,mooshrooms,goatsandsheep.
- Carrots,beetroots, orpotatoescan attractpigs.
- Seedsof any type leadchickens.
- Carrots,dandelionsandgolden carrotsmay be used to attractrabbits.

Once they're in the pen and fed, the animals pair off and reproduce. Experience orbs are granted on successful breeding. Both animals cannot breed for five minutes afterward. Two adults make one child per breeding, which take about 20 minutes to grow up and do not drop any items or experience on death before then.

Chickens, apart from being bred with seeds, can also lay eggs that can be thrown for a chance to produce chicks (there is a low chance more than one chicken generates). This process can also be fully automated with the use of dispensers to create a fully automatic chicken farm.

Shearing a sheep yields 1-3 blocks of wool instead of the usual singular block obtained from killing the sheep. This process can also be automated with dispensers. However, sheep must eat a grass block in order to regrow their wool coat, meaning a large pen with plenty grass blocks to recover their wool after shearing is necessary for wool production. Large amounts of sheep can turn all of the grass inside of the farm into dirt, which can be avoided by placing few neighboring grass blocks should be placed outside of reach of the pen where they can safely regrow back into the pen.

A building to house the animals may prove useful useful to avoid nasty surprises in the form of skeletons, creepers, and other hostile mobs from finding their way into the animal pen and creating a mess. Lighting does the same job, but doesn't protect from outside attackers firing in or blocking the entrance, especially in the case of phantoms.

### Entity cramming farm

  

This tutorial is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


Only 24 living entities may be in a single block at once before dying from entity cramming. If there is a mix of adult and baby animals, the adults die first, which allows for construction of a farm that relies on entity cramming. This does work for pigs and sheep, but cows are usually chosen for access to leather.

1. Prepare a two-deep hole with solid blocks on all four sides, and a hopper at the bottom pointing under the blocks on one side. Whichever way the hopper points becomes the front of the crusher.
2. Place a chest connected to the hopper, and replace the block over it with an upside-down stair so you can get at the chest.
3. Put a water source at the bottom of the hole, and lead two or more cows to fall into it.
4. Place a fence or wall over the hole to keep the animals in the hole and other things out.
5. Feed the animals until the entity cramming limit is reached.
	- While less effective in that it loses out on experience and looting, it automates the process and drastically reduces the amount of time it takes to farm animals.

### Breeding tips
Breeding twice doubles the population of the animals if the offspring are not included in the equation. Killing half the animals after breeding keeps the population stable with maximum product.

When breeding large amounts of animals in a fenced pen, it can be difficult to leave the pen without animals escaping. Some ways to deal with this:

- Go to the opposite side of the pen as the door you intend to use, and pull out the appropriate food, to gather the animals there. Then switch items (putting the food away) and quickly run to the gate. Because they no longer follow you, the animals are not fast enough to get to the other side of the pen when you do. This gets more difficult with large crowds, so other methods may be necessary.
- Placingcarpetson a fence allows players to get in and out without mobs doing the same.
- A double gate can provide an "airlock" to give you a chance to intercept any animals that follow you through the first gate.

## Automated animal farming
See also: Tutorials/Egg farming

An output of an automated pig cooking device
Most of these farms include a killing mechanism, a cooking mechanism for the meat and an item collector, usually a hopper. The cooking mechanism and killing mechanism are often combined, in the form of lava or fire.

### Lava blade
This design is mostly used with cows, pigs and sheep. It uses a sticky piston water gate to control the amount of animals to be cooked. They drop through a "lava blade", which enables their meat to be cooked efficiently. Note that this does not work on rabbits due to their small size and jumpiness.

### Simple redstone activated cooked meat farm
- Function: This is an easy farm to setup that just requires breeding and can be activated with the press of a button, making the process highly efficient, cooking directly meat and collecting it. This farm works for cows, sheep and pigs.

- Construction:

1. Construct a holding area with flowing water for the adults, a collection area for the baby animals with a 1 block high entrance and a sign to block the water flow from the adult area
2. The collection area should be only 1 block in area, consisting of a hopper connected to a chest, and a dispenser holding a bucket of lava facing into the collection area, with two separateredstone wiresconnected to it.
3. One redstone wire must be connected to threerepeatersset to 4, 4 and 3 ticks. On the other wire, there must be only one set to default (one tick). Both of the leads must connect up to astone button.

- Preparation:

1. Lead animals into the holding area before adding flowing water.
2. Breed them until you have the correct amount. This amount can be adjusted, however, adding too many adults may impede progress of babies being swept into the collection area.

- Usage:

1. Breed the amount of animals you need. Let them fall into the collection area and wait until they grow. Activate the dispenser and collect the drops from the chest.

### Fully automatic chicken cooker
- Function: This machine is inexpensive and fully automatic, making it a great source ofcooked chickenandfeathers.

- Construction:

1. Dig a one block wide, two blocks deep hole in the ground. Place a chest on the bottom and a hopper over it. On top of the hopper, place a non-flammable slab and build non-flammable walls around the slab, at least 3 blocks high.
2. Remove a block in the wall next to the slab and place a dispenser, connected to a power source, such as a comparator to detect eggs inside and fire them. Place at least one hopper on top of the dispenser. It should reach as high as the wall surrounding the slab.
3. Place lava onto the block above the slab.
4. Place a hopper connected to the dispenser, and build a roof, making sure to put torches inside of the area before closing it off. Add a trapdoor to add chickens.

- Preparation:

1. Gather as many eggs as you can or will, the more the merrier.
2. Open the trap door and throw all of the eggs in. Some of them should hatch into baby chickens and start wandering above the hopper.

- How it works: The chickens above the hopper, when grown up,  start laying eggs, which are transported through the hopper into the dispenser, which shoots them onto the slab, hatching them. The baby chickens are not tall enough to get burnt by the lava that is directly above their heads, so the chickens won't be burnt until they grow up. The drops are picked up by the hopper under the slab and deposited into the chest below.

### Steakatron 2000


- Construction:

1. Start with adouble chestat the desired front. Place a 2×2 grid ofhopperspointing into the chest behind it. Above the chest, place a 2×2 of glass or other transparent block.
2. Make a rear wall of glass. For each side, add two pillars of opaque blocks 3 high.
3. Make the top front block on each side adispenserpointing inward with abuttonon front of it. Place awater bucketinside the left one, and alava bucketin the right one.
4. Placesignsinside at ground level on the 4 internal walls of the blocks. This holds the lava above the heads of the animals.
5. Make stairs running up to the roof for the left side. Add a roof made by ring of stairs around the outside and attaching fourtrapdoorsto the bottom of the side stairs directly above the internal space.

- Preparation:

1. Lead yourcowsinside by holding wheat and standing on top opposite the stairs with the trapdoors open, then close all trapdoors and get down. Kill any remaining cattle by hand.

- Usage:

1. Pick wheat off the chest and breed all the cows. Close all trapdoors when done.
2. Decide whether you wantraw beef(for trading with butchers) orsteak(also known as cooked beef on BE) (for eating). Press the appropriate button, wait for the adults to die, then press the button again. If you needexperience, you can open the trapdoors and slaughter them by hand.

If cattle is needed elsewhere, leave the trapdoors open and hit the water button until a sufficient number have escaped.

### 


It greatly speeds up the production of raw porkchops and cooked porkchops by utilizing a gap made by a repeater with a block above to separate the pigs and piglets.

- Construction:

1. Killing chamber:
	- If using lava on the dispenser as described below, skip this step.
2. Cooking selection:
	- This steps may be skipped if only one kind of meat is planned to use.
3. Separator:
	1. Behind the collection hopper, connect two more in a line. Use these to create a 2 deep containment pit. It is advisable to use glass on the right side to make it easier to check if the pigs have died.
	2. Remove the rear lowest wall block to extend the hopper line and place afence gate. On the outside of the block left to the gate, place a lever to control it. Behind the gate, place a repeater with a solid block above it. This creates a gap that baby pigs can pass through, but adult pigs cannot.
4. Finishing up:
	- It's possible to swap the water bucket with a lava bucket. This will produce cooked meat without using a furnace. If you only need raw meat, skip the furnace and the selector. If you want to use both kinds of meat, follow this method. Alternatively, a method similar to the Steak-a-tron 2000 may be applied to this machine.

- Preparation:

Lead your pigs via the operator stairs and gate into the slaughterhouse.

- Usage:

It is advisable to note these instructions on signs near the machine.

1. Select options: raw or cooked.
2. Open side gate, close top gate. This allows piglets to escape and be unable to re-enter the slaughterhouse.
3. Open the trapdoor and breed the pigs, then close the trapdoor, and still holding the carrots, move to the rear of the machine to attract piglets out of the slaughterhouse. Once all piglets are out, put the carrots away.
4. Return to the operator gate and look out to the left of the machine for the drowning button and press it. Wait until all pigs have died and press the button again to retract the water.
5. Close the side gate, hold your carrots again, and open the top gate to attrct piglets into the slaughterhouse again. Once all of them are in, close the trapdoor and collect your food from the chest. If using the cooked option, expect some delay while the furnace cooks all the food. If playing above 1.14, use asmokerto speed up the process.

- Modification notes:

Adult pigs cannot fall through a single trapdoor. A single water source dispenser does not drown pigs in any block more than 1 square away. It is possible to use redstone dust to relocate all controls to the front of the machine or the operator gate area if so desired. It is also possible to use an inverter circuit to ensure the top gate and side gate are always in opposite states.

### Simple one minute sheep farm
** Video **



** Function **
This machine is able to produce stacks of wool while being built in an effortless minute.

** Construction **
Collection system:

1. Find a flat patch of grass
2. Dig a 2 block long and 2 block deep hole
3. Dig out the side 4 blocks
4. On the end of the short side of the L shape, place a chest and then place a hopper running into it on the side
5. place above the chest a flicked lever
6. place powered rails within the long side of the L and then place in a minecart

These steps are illustrated below.

- Dig 2×2 hole
- Dig out the side 4 blocks

Shearing system:

1. Place above the powered rails dirt and then place on the short side of the L more dirt next to it
2. Place on the one end of the dirt an observer running out from the dirt block
3. Place in front of the observer a block and then two blocks next to it
4. Run down 5 blocks on the side and then place dispensers on top of that
5. Place redstone on top of all stone brick and dispensers
6. Create a holding cell for the sheep with slabs above the dirt blocks so that they can grow
7. Put shears into each dispensers

These steps are illustrated below.

- Place observer
- Blocks in front of observer
- Sheep holding cell

** Usage **
Make sure the dispensers are well filled with shears and the machine automatically collects wool for you. Flick the lever to turn off

** Modification notes **
You can easily expand this design to add more dispensers by lengthening it on the side. You can also breed sheep inside this farm to give more opportunities to shear wool.

### Falling auto-spawn trap

** Resources **
You need:

- A light source, such astorchesorglowstone
- Trapdoors
- Signs
- Fences
- Aredstoneloop
- Dispensers
- Hoppers
- Water buckets
- Stones
- Chests

** Step 1 **


Choose any place and put fences here, the fenced area can be bigger, but it's recommended to be big.
In this tutorial, the fenced area is small.

** Step 2 **


Make a 2×2 hole. It's recommended to be deep, but if it's smaller, read the optional part later.

** Step 3 **


Place a trapdoor and open it.

** Step 4 **


Place four hoppers.

** Step 5 **


Place four more hoppers and make a hole in the wall.

** Step 6 **


Place two dispensers at the front of the hopper, then place water and a double chest.

** Step 7 **


Make a redstone loop.

** Step 8 **


Close the hole in the wall, where the redstone loop is. 

** Step 9 **


Close another hole in the wall. If you have a little hole or you want cooked steak, read the optional steps.

** Optional steps **

Place two signs.


Then place lava.

### Hoglin farming
Hoglins are hostile Nether mobs only found on Crimson Forests and a great source of pork and leather, but they deal massive amounts of damage and knockback to unprepared players, sometimes even knocking off players to lava. However warped fungus repels hoglins. Make a platform for the hoglins to spawn (in a Crimson Forest), place the fungus near the edges with a fence on top to prevent the hoglins from getting stuck.

Then build simple killing chamber with campfires or lava, a storage system and finally some trapdoor.

For starters, you can utilize Shulkercraft's design. It's a fairly simple build and even with its small size it can produce 1700 porkchops per hour. 




However, if you want a better and faster farm, you can build this layered farm built by Somecallmetimm.




## Semi-automated farming
### Sheep farm
This design can shear 100+ sheep in a minute.




** Construction **
First, you need to make a flowing water wheat farm, but with higher sides and about 12 blocks wide.

1. Create adirt/grassplatform 5×8 blocks. The outside grass blocks, built around this platform, act as walls, built up 3 blocks so the sheep don’t jump out.You can use any solid block (can’t use fences or glass panels as sheep get stuck), but you need a way for the grass to grow in the farm. Otherwise, the sheep don’t regrow their wool. Build an extra level around with grass blocks.
2. Build another level, same dimension (5×8), with the smaller length touching the previous platform. One block above that, place a piston facing down. This allows you to manage the water flow.
3. Cover the water area with a solid block and have redstone repeaters facing the pistons. Connect them up with a line of redstone and drag it to the other end of the structure. Use a lever to turn them on and ensure all the pistons go down and are powered. If not you may need a few redstone repeaters to keep power going. When all the pistons are powered you can put in the water blocks behind the pistons and ensure the water flows down the first level but stops just before the hole.
4. You need a bridge 2 blocks high and 5 long with half-slabs at the other end. This is where your sheep fall into. Build a 3 block high wall around this area and at the end, place half slabs. The half slabs allow you to gather the wool without gates and stops the sheep from jumping out of your farm.
5. On one side of your sheep farm, the water supply makes the sheep bounce. Build a 3×4 outline using solid blocks that connects to your outer wall, but one block below. Below this, build 2 pistons between the water blocks and the sheep platform. Ensure there is a block below the water holding area. Next, connect up the pistons with redstone.
6. One level below that build 2 rows of sticky pistons that face upward in the middle of your sheep collecting pit. Place grass blocks on these.
7. Point repeaters to all the pistons and connect up with redsone.
8. Move all your levers and redstone paths for easy access, ensuring the lines don’t switch up and power something they shouldn’t, then label them. You should now have one switch powering the water source, another that raises and lowers the platform at the bottom, and the last that turns on and off the water source that makes the sheep bounce. Test to ensure they are all working then go get yourself some sheep!

Warning: If the gathering switch is turned on, ensure the harvesting/other water is off. If they are both on together, the sheep bounce over each other and escape.

Remember, if one water is on, the other must be off. The procedure is as follows:

1. Lower the platform.
2. Turn on water torrent.
3. Wait until all the sheep are in the hole.
4. Turn off the gathering switch.
5. Turn on the harvesting switch.
6. Grab your shears, right click and point to a sheep. As they bounce, you collect wool. Ensure you get all sheep by moving around a bit.
7. Turn off the water and raise the platform.
8. Jump in and collect all the wool.

** Notes **
- The solid blocks can be switched around to make different designs. The only important ones are the grass blocks in the center.
- This design has been tested with 100 sheep successfully but with that many problems arise. If some of your sheep are missing, they may have glitched through a wall or suffocated due to the maxEntityCramming gamerule.
- Max time between harvesting: Unknown
- Max number of sheep possible: Unknown
- Max number of water levels you can create: Theoretically infinite
- If you would like it to be wider, you can mirror the design and have two water bodies joining together. However this is the widest combination because you have to be able to control the water.

As you can now use shears in dispensers, fully automated wool farms designs are now available.
