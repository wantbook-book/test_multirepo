### Getting Wood

Goal: Pick up a wood block.

This achievement requires you to hold down the hit/mine button while facing a block of wood until it breaks, then walking over it to pick it up.

Wood blocks are found on trees, which are very easy to find in most biomes, excluding the ocean, desert or badlands biomes.

Logs can also be found in swamp huts, villages, pillager outposts, and woodland mansions.



### Benchmaking

Goal: Construct a crafting table.

Obtain a block of wood and open your inventory. In the four-block crafting space, place the log and pick up the planks from the output slot. Distribute these four planks evenly in the crafting space to make a 2×2 square and pick up the resulting crafting table.

Alternatively, use the recipe book and just click the crafting table to craft it.



### 

Goal: Construct a wooden hoe.

Place the crafting table you just made on the ground, and right-click with your mouse on it, to use it. If you changed the use item/place block key to something else, use that instead.

Then make some sticks, note that this can also be done in your inventory crafting grid:

| Ingredients | Input » Output |
|-------------|----------------|
| Wood Planks | 4              |

Now arrange your sticks and some planks in the crafting table to make a hoe:

| Ingredients        | Input » Output |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Wood Planks+Sticks |                |



### Bake Bread

Goal: Make bread.

Break several blocks of short grass until you gain three wheat seeds. You can do this with one seed but it will take longer.

Then right-click with your hoe on three dirt, podzol, or grass blocks to create farmland, preferably near water, so the seeds get hydrated, and grow faster.

Next, hold the seeds, and right-click on all the farmland blocks. Wait for 1-3 in-game days for the seeds to grow into wheat. Alternately, using bone meal on the seeds will cause it to grow into wheat faster.

After that, break the wheat.

Arrange the wheat like so to craft bread:

| Ingredients | Input » Output |
|-------------|----------------|
| Wheat       |                |



### 

Goal: Make cake.

This achievement is a reference to the video game Portal which spawned the meme phrase "The Cake Is A Lie".

Collect the following:

- 1egg(can be obtained fromchicken)
- 3milk buckets(milka cow using abucketby right-clicking)
- 2sugar(fromsugar cane)
- 3wheat

If you don't have a bucket, you can also craft it using iron ingots.

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Iron Ingot  |                 |

Arrange the ingredients like so to craft cake:

| Ingredients                                | Crafting recipe |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|

###

Arrange the ingredients like so to craft a wooden sword:

| Ingredients        | Input » Output |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Wood Planks+Sticks |                |



### Cow Tipper

Goal: Pick up leather.

Find a cow, mooshroom, horse, donkey, or llama. Cows can appear at any place with grass blocks and enough light, unless it is an ocean biome. Horses and Donkeys can only spawn in a plains and savanna biome. Red mooshroom only spawn in mushroom fields biome. Llamas only spawn in mountains and savanna biomes. You may have to wander a bit to find one, so make sure you'll be able to find your way back.

Then when you find one, stand next to it and left-click to hit it. You will need to hit it a lot to kill it. They can drop one or two leather (cows along with raw beef). If you did not get any, try the same with another cow, mooshroom, horse, donkey, or llama.

Another way to obtain the achievement is to find and kill some rabbits until you have 4 rabbit hides. Then craft leather and throw it on the ground. When you pick it up, you'll get the achievement.

Another way is by fishing leather if you have luck.



### Repopulation

Goal: Breed two cows with each-other.

Use wheat on 2 cows or 2 mooshrooms to make them breed.



### When Pigs Fly

Goal: Take any amount of fall damage when riding on a pig.

Get a saddle and a carrot on a stick.

Use the saddle on a pig, which should be near a cliff. The easiest way to get it to jump off a cliff is to hold a carrot on a stick in your hand and walk, like you normally would, in the direction of the cliff until you and the pig fall.

Alternatively, you can put the pig on a piston, trapdoor, fence gate, or any kind of opening mechanism. Then ride the pig up there and open the mechanism so you and the pig will take fall damage.



### Monster Hunter

Goal: Kill a hostile mob (monster).

Find a hostile mob. In the Overworld, they can only spawn in darkness, so you should wait until night, or find a dark area like a cave. In the Nether, most can spawn in bright areas. In the End, endermen can only spawn in darkness. You can also find a spawner in a dungeon, mineshaft, stronghold, nether fortress, or woodland mansion and wait for a monster to spawn. Silverfish can be hidden in stone blocks in mountains biomes, and will spawn when the stone is broken.

Then hit it until it dies. With a sword or some tools, this goes faster.



### Sniper Duel

Goal: Kill a skeleton by shooting it from a distance of at least 50 blocks.

Find a large flat area on the surface. Dig a trench one and a half blocks deep, two blocks wide and several blocks long. Line the trench with light. Just over 50 meters away from the lip of the trench, make a tower 15 blocks high. When night comes, wait for a skeleton to fall into the trench or lure it in. Then from your tower, aim just above the skeleton, about halfway between it and the horizon, and fire from full charge until it dies. With a Flame enchantment, you can see where your arrows landed better and can adjust your aim easier, but the skeleton might die of the fire, not giving the achievement.



### 

Goal: Construct a Wooden Pickaxe.

Make sure that you have 3 planks and 2 sticks in your inventory.

Arrange the ingredients like so or click the wooden pickaxe button in the recipe book to craft a wooden pickaxe:

| Ingredients        | Input » Output |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Wood Planks+Sticks |                |



### Getting an Upgrade

Goal: Construct a cobblestone, or better, pickaxe from sticks and cobblestone, or other better ingredients.

Use your new wooden pickaxe to mine some stone, which in return you will receive cobblestone. Make sure that you have 2 sticks in your inventory.

| Ingredients        | Input » Output |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Cobblestone+Sticks |                |



### Overpowered

Goal: Eat an Enchanted Apple.

These can not be crafted as of 1.9. You must now find them in desert temple, dungeon, mineshaft, bastion remnant, ruined portal, or woodland mansion.



### Hot Topic

Goal: Construct a furnace.

Mine 8 blocks of cobblestone and open your crafting table. Arrange the cobblestone like so to craft a furnace:

| Ingredients | Input » Output |
|-------------|----------------|
| Cobblestone |                |



### Delicious Fish

Goal: Obtain the item that gets created after cooking fish.

The easiest way to catch a fish is to swim underwater and using a sword, attacking the salmon/cod.

Alternatively, you can craft and use a fishing rod. Cast your rod into a water body, then right-click so the "bait" lands into the water, and wait till it comes closer to the rod and right-click again when you hear a splash sound. The fish fly toward you and probably will be picked up by you too. 

At last, put the cod or salmon you got in the furnace with fuel like so:

| Ingredients                           | Smelting recipe |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Raw Codor<br/>Raw Salmon+<br/>Anyfuel |                 |



### Acquire Hardware

Goal: Pick up an iron ingot.

Mine iron ore with a stone pickaxe, and put it in the furnace like so:

| Ingredients           | Smelting recipe |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Raw Iron+<br/>Anyfuel |                 |

Alternatively you can find them in various loot chests, and are also a rare drop from zombies.



### On a Rail

Goal: Travel 500 blocks with a minecart from where you started.

It will take at least 192 iron ingots as well as 32 sticks to craft enough rails (512 or 8 stacks). Alternatively, you can find and break them in mineshafts or woodland mansions. Then, build a continuous track so that a minecart can travel the full distance. Afterward, place a minecart on the start of the track, then travel from the start to the end without leaving the minecart.
The achievement does not allow you to repeatedly loop the same section of the track.

You will most likely need powered rails to get this achievement. These will take additional resources. You can also make a gradual decline from a great height to use gravity instead of powered rails.



### 

Goal: Pick up a diamond.

Look in various loot chests or search below layer 16 for diamond ore (layer 5-12 is also good, layer 12 is the best; press F3 to see your coordinates) and destroy it using your iron pickaxe. Creeper or TNT explosions have a chance of dropping the diamond as well. Mineshafts are extremely useful for this achievement.

Arrange the ingredients like so to craft an iron pickaxe:

| Ingredients       | Input » Output |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Iron Ingot+Sticks |                |



### 

Goal: Throw a diamond at another player.

Drop/throw a diamond at another player using Q or the key that you use.



### Enchanter

Goal: Craft an Enchantment Table

Make a diamond pickaxe so you can mine at least 4 obsidian (or find it in various loot chests):

| Ingredients     | Input » Output |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Diamonds+Sticks |                |

Then get 3 paper and 1 leather, the paper being made from sugar canes like so:

| Ingredients | Input » Output |
|-------------|----------------|
| Sugar Cane  | 3              |

Then craft a book like so:

| Ingredients   | Input » Output |
|---------------|----------------|
| Leather+Paper |                |

Arrange the ingredients like so to craft an enchantment table:

| Ingredients           | Input » Output |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Book+Diamond+Obsidian |                |



### Librarian

Goal: Construct a bookshelf.

Make sure you have 6 planks and 3 books in your inventory,

Arrange the ingredients like so to craft a bookshelf:

| Ingredients      | Input » Output |
|------------------|----------------|
| Wood Planks+Book |                |

To achieve the maximum potential from the enchantment table, place 15 bookshelves 1 block away from the enchantment table (in a box shape), like this:



|  |  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |

Although not required, this is the most efficient method to acquire the highest enchantment possible. Any additional bookshelves around the enchantment table beyond 15 will not increase the maximum level beyond 30 and will only serve aesthetic purposes.



### Overkill

Goal: Deal 9 hearts of damage in one hit.

Enchant a sword with Bane of Arthropods, Smite, or Sharpness with a level high enough to deal together with the sword's base damage at least 18 × 9 in one hit to a mob/player. Alternatively, enchant trident with Impaling. Potions of strength will count as increased damage so strength will make this achievement easier. The netherite sword is the easiest.



### Into the Nether

Goal: Create a Nether Portal

Collect at least 10 obsidian with a diamond or netherite pickaxe and build a nether portal. If you cannot get obsidian in item form, create a mold and pour water next to lava source blocks (more details can be found in Tutorials/Nether survival). Light the nether portal with flint and steel.

Place your obsidian blocks like so, upright. The cobblestone can be replaced with obsidian, or any other block (including air).



|  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

You can make nether portals up to 23×23, but it is not recommended as it requires a lot of obsidian.



### Return to Sender

Goal: Kill a ghast with a fireball.

Aim at the ghast then punch the fireball when it is close enough to you to deflect it. If you can perfectly aim, a shot arrow or fishing rod bobber may hit the fireball and deflect it, or you can hit it back with a sword. When you are hitting it you have to time it right, and to hit it back with a sword you use the use button with a sword in your hand.



### Into Fire

Goal: Pick up a blaze rod.

Kill a blaze and collect its dropped blaze rod. An easy way to do this is to find a nether fortress, then find a blaze spawner. Armed with over 7 snowballs, attack the blaze from range. Blazes don’t always drop their rods so you might have to try a few times. A potion of Fire Resistance is useful. Upon the blaze's death, collect the rod.



### Local Brewery

Goal: Pick up a Potion from one of the 3 lower Brewing Stand's slots.

Get a water bottle, Place it in one of the 3 lower brewing stand's slots, then put blaze powder in the fuel slot. Then put a potion ingredient in it, and wait until it is done brewing. If you don't have glass bottle, you can craft it using glass. To create glass, smelt sand:

| Ingredients       | Smelting recipe |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Sand+<br/>Anyfuel |                 |

Next, craft an glass bottle:

| Ingredients | Input » Output |
|-------------|----------------|
| Glass       | 3              |

Then fill the glass bottle with water, to turn it into a water bottle.

Arrange the ingredients like so to craft a brewing stand:

| Ingredients           | Input » Output |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Blaze Rod+Cobblestone |                |



### 

Goal: Enter an end portal.

Throw ender eyes and follow them to locate a stronghold.

Then find the stronghold's portal room.

After that activate the portal by using an eye of ender in every empty end portal edge block slot, then jump into the portal.

Arrange the ingredients like so to craft an eye of ender:

| Ingredients              | Input » Output |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| Ender Pearl+Blaze Powder |                |



### Adventuring Time

Goal: Set foot in 17 biomes.

Travel and step into 17 biomes in the game.

Note: This achievement is almost unobtainable in old worlds.

### The End.

Goal: Enter the Exit Portal after killing the ender dragon.

Here is how to slay it:

- Destroy theend crystalsusing projectiles (likesnowballs,eggs,boworcrossbowwitharrows, etc.)
- After they are destroyed, hit the ender dragon using projectiles (like bow with arrows, etc.). An enchantedbowwould probably be the best option.

Goal: Spawn the wither.

Here are some tips for how to spawn it:

- Soul sandorsoul soilare not that difficult to acquire. It can be found in the Nether in soul sand valley biomes. Just watch out forghastsand other hostile mobs that spawn in the Nether.Wither skulls on the other hand are difficult to obtain. Here are the best tips available.
- To increase spawn rates, break down the walls to have more floor space.
- Remove anyblazesand theirspawners, (unless you are skilled in making experience farms using them).
- Wear diamond armor (or netherite) and bring a fire resistance potion (for blazes and accidental lava deaths).
- It is also helpful to have a diamond sword (or netherite) with theLootingIII enchantment.
- Have lots of patience. You'll need it since wither skulls are a rare drop and you need 3.
- Be careful of the wither skeleton's attacks. They give you the Wither effect, which is poisonous and extremely deadly. It may be a good idea to bring milk.
- Snowballs are also a terrific way to defeat blazes.
- Every 15 blocks or so, put a bar so the walkway is only two blocks high. Wither skeletons cannot walk under anything that is less than three blocks tall.

Once you have three wither skeleton skulls and four soul sand, build the wither as follows:

Goal: Kill the wither.

This is the easiest way to defeat the wither, however, some would say it takes the fun out of killing the wither. It's your game, so play it how you want to play. but this is the most efficient way:

- Go to the Nether.
- Dig up until you reach the top bedrock.
- Look for a 3×3 area of bedrock with the center block so it has nothing behind it.
- Exactly three blocks down, place a piston. Next to it place a lever.
- Spawn the wither on the piston and pull the lever before it blows up. Run out of the blast radius.
- Once the wither blows up, it will be stuck in the bedrock ceiling and can't do any more damage. At this point hit it with whatever you like. It's kind of inefficient to do it with fists, but you could do it with anything, be careful when it reach half health, wither will explode and spawn 3-4 wither skeletons around it, and can start using dash attack. A netherite sword with Smite enchantment is quickest.
- Once the wither is dead, pick up the nether star.
