# Tutorials/Basalt farming
Basalt farming is the technique of using a basalt generator to produce basalt without needing to mine for it from basalt deltas or from basalt pillars. Basalt generators work on the principle that when a lava stream encounters both blue ice and soul soil, it will produce the block, which can be mined with a pickaxe and used for decoration. Please note that soul sand will not work when making a basalt farm; only soul soil will.
