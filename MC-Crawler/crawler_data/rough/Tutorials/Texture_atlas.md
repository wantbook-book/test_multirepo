# Texture atlas
A texture atlas, also known as a spritesheet, is an arrangement of game sprites on a single image file, used by the game to store and access associated sprites more efficiently than with individual files.

Minecraft uses both procedurally-generated and predefined texture atlases for different purposes, however all but a very small handful of predefined atlases have since been split into individual files for compilation into larger atlases.

## Procedurally-generated texture atlases
Block and item textures are combined into the same atlas, minecraft_textures_atlas_blocks.png_0.png. This texture atlas is generated via F3 + S and is saved into a folder titled “debug” in .minecraft's screenshots folder.

All other textures are also available in their own respective texture atlases in said .minecraft/screenshots/debug folder. For example, the particle atlas is minecraft_textures_atlas_particles.png_0.png, while the chest atlas is minecraft_textures_atlas_chest.png_0.png, minecraft_textures_atlas_decorated_pot.png_0.png.

## Predefined texture atlases
### Current
The following texture atlas files are still in use as of Java Edition 1.20.4. It is not known if Mojang plans to split these into their constituent textures in the future, potentially replacing them with a procedurally-generated atlas.

Fonts also use a texture atlas system, however this is data-driven, unlike the following cases, which are hardcoded.

#### experience_orb.png
This file is used for each size of experience orb. The five last textures are unused. The changing coloration used for experience orbs is done via a hardcoded tint system, rather than proper animation as is done for most animated textures, and the translucency is also hardcoded instead of being controlled by the texture's alpha channel.
