## Description

  

This section needs expansion. 
You can help by expanding it.


The base Minecraft game logo is 3D text containing "MINECRAFT", rotated slightly upward. It appears to be made of cracked stone in older designs, or stone with etch marks in newer designs, and the letter A has the face of a creeper as a hole. Several variations exist, also containing 3D text though not always with the stone material.

### Historical changes
Minecraft's first logo was originally showcased only at Notch's personal blog The Word of Notch. It was designed as the word "MINECRAFT" formed by cobblestone blocks.

An updated version of the previous logo was first seen on the official website on May 22, 2009 and it would later be used in-game when the phase of Indev (v0.31) started on December 23. Changes include that the logo was made brighter and a shadow was added to it. It could be seen only at the menu screen against a wall made of dirt. It was later used in Infdev and early Alpha versions.

In Alpha 1.0.4, the texture of the blocks were changed from cobblestone to stone. An animation was also added where the stone blocks would fall to the wall forming the word "Minecraft" (this feature along with the logo was removed in Beta 1.4).

Mojang unveiled Minecraft's most well known logo in Beta 1.4, the previous design was replaced with a hand drawn stone-like lettering, in which the iconic face of the creeper was added to the "A".

The logo was slightly retouched in Beta 1.8, some of the reflections of the letters were a bit decreased. This is the design that would later be used for the full release of the game (v1.0.0) on November 18, 2011 and also seen in merchandise and other media.

In 2017, the PC version of Minecraft was renamed as the Java Edition to separate it from Bedrock Edition, which was renamed from Pocket Edition to just Minecraft by the Better Together Update. This logo was introduced in version 1.12.2 and while most versions of Minecraft uses the main design that was established since 2015, Java Edition kept using the original with the addition of the "Java Edition" subtitle. The logo was modified in version 1.16, the gray tone of the letters was made lighter and thick outline was added around them.

On August 31, 2021, one of Mojang's workers, Ined, officially announced on his Twitter account that a flat logo would begin to be used for the franchise while the detailed one would still be used for the game itself. This change took effect on Minecraft's official website. The logo itself looks similar to the polished logo used for Minecraft Live and Minecraft Festival, but with minor changes like the outline is thicker, the reflections in the letters were removed and the creeper face in the "A" was slightly altered.
