## Minecraft
The heart and story of the game

Requirements: Have a crafting table in your inventory.

Get a crafting table in your inventory to obtain this advancement. First, hold down the attack on a log until it breaks, then collect the dropped block by walking over it. Logs are part of trees, which are very easy to find (as long as you didn't start out in a biome like ocean or desert). Just look around when you spawn.

Then, open your inventory. You will see a 2×2 grid near the top right-hand corner; place your wood log in any of the slots. Click on the planks that appear to obtain them.

44444444244
If you turned on a bonus chest when you created your world, there is a good chance that it will contain logs, planks, or both. If you have these, you probably won't need to get any wood to create a crafting table.

Finally, put one of the four planks you got into each container of your grid (a 2×2 square of planks). You can use to place a single plank into the grid, instead of all four.


Once you have the crafting table in your inventory, you will get the advancement.

Parent of: Stone Age

## Stone Age
Mine stone with your new pickaxe

Requirements: Have cobblestone, cobbled deepslate or blackstone in your inventory.

First, place your crafting table on the ground by holding the crafting table in your hand and use the ground. Follow the crafting recipe below to make sticks (note that this can also be done in the 2×2 crafting grid in your inventory):

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| AnyPlanks   | 4               |

Now arrange your sticks and some planks in the crafting table to make a wooden pickaxe. You may need to get more wood in order to have enough to make a wooden pickaxe.

| Ingredients          | Crafting recipe |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| AnyPlanks+<br/>Stick |                 |

Next, you must find stone, and mine it with your wooden pickaxe to get cobblestone (stone will become cobblestone if you mine it with a normal pickaxe, without the Silk Touch enchantment). Exposed stone can be found on the sides of hills and in ravines/caves. If you find a cave or ravine, be wary of any hostile mobs (such as zombies and skeletons) that might be inside.

If you are in the Nether or below Y=8, you can also mine blackstone or deepslate to get this advancement, although the chances of you getting to the Nether or finding a deepslate blob without picking up any cobblestone are very slim. Blackstone is commonly found in the basalt deltas biome. You may also find blackstone in other biomes near the lava sea.

Parent of: Getting an Upgrade

## Getting an Upgrade
Construct a better pickaxe

Requirements: Have a stone pickaxe in your inventory.

You need to make a stone pickaxe. Using your wooden pickaxe, mine three stone blocks so you have three cobblestone blocks (again, as in Stone Age, you can use cobbled deepslate or blackstone for this).

Now arrange your sticks and cobblestone/blackstone/deepslate blocks in the crafting table to make a stone pickaxe:

| Ingredients                    | Crafting recipe |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| Anystone-tier block+<br/>Stick |                 |

Stone pickaxe also can spawn in the bonus chest, be bought from novice-level toolsmith villagers, or obtained through toolsmith villager gifts.

Parent of: Acquire Hardware

## Acquire Hardware
Smelt an iron ingot

Requirements: Have an iron ingot in your inventory.

The intended method for getting iron ingots is to find iron ore. It is found at almost any height in the Overworld, except layers 73 to 79; it is most common at Y = 16, but it can also be easily found in mountains if they are nearby. The two main ways to find iron ore are to find it in a cave, or to find it in an exposed stone surface either on the ground or in the side of a hill/mountain. Because caves often have monsters in them, they are not recommended to go into until you have some armor and weapons, so finding an exposed surface in the ground with iron in it is much safer. If there are no caves or exposed stone surfaces near you, you could start a mineshaft. If you are feeling very daring and adventurous, make a stone sword and a few torches, and search a cave. You can usually find iron in caves very quickly, because walls of caves will expose a lot of blocks.

Once you find iron ore, mine it with your stone pickaxe (don't mine it with a wooden pickaxe, it won't drop anything). It will drop raw iron (unless you mined it with the Silk Touch enchantment, in which case it will drop an iron ore).

Then make a furnace using cobblestone, blackstone or cobbled deepslate and put the raw iron or iron ore in it along with a fuel source, such as planks or coal. After 10 seconds, it yields an iron ingot.

| Ingredients         | Crafting recipe |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Anystone-tier block |                 |

|--------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Raw Ironor<br/>Iron Ore+<br/>Anyfuel |                 |

If you are lucky, you can find iron ingots in chests in village blacksmiths, armorer's house or toolsmith's house; desert temples, dungeons, mineshafts, jungle pyramids, shipwrecks, buried treasures, pillager outposts, woodland mansions, strongholds, nether fortresses, bastions and end cities. 

Iron nuggets can also spawn in chests in ruined portals, bastions, shipwrecks, and village taiga houses. If you have 9 iron nuggets, you can turn them into 1 iron ingot.

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Iron Nugget |                 |

Bastion chests can also generate a block of iron, which you can turn into 9 iron ingots.

| Ingredients   | Crafting recipe |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Block of Iron | 9               |

Iron golems can spawn in villages and pillager outposts. When killed, the golem drops 3-5 iron ingots. Note that an iron golem on any difficulty beyond Peaceful will fight back if you try to kill it, and it deals lots of damage, so this method is not recommended to inexperienced players. 

Zombies, husks and zombie villagers also have a chance to drop 1 iron ingot. Iron nuggets also can be obtained by smelting iron tools, weapons, armor, horse armor, or chainmail armor, and by bartering.

| Ingredients                                                                                                     | Smelting recipe |

| Iron Swordor<br/>Anyiron toolsor<br/>Anyiron armoror<br/>Anychainmail armoror<br/>Iron Horse Armor+<br/>Anyfuel |                 |

You will get the advancement once you transfer the iron ingot to your inventory. Iron ingots can further be made into many useful tools, weapons, and armor.

Parent of: Suit Up | Hot Stuff | Isn't It Iron Pick

## Suit Up
Protect yourself with a piece of iron armor

Requirements: Have any type of iron armor in your inventory.

Iron armor can be crafted like so:

| Name            | Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Iron Helmet     | Iron Ingot  |                 |
| Iron Chestplate | Iron Ingot  |                 |
| Iron Leggings   | Iron Ingot  |                 |
| Iron Boots      | Iron Ingot  |                 |

Iron armor can also spawn in chests in villages (armorer's house and blacksmiths), ancient cities, strongholds and end cities, and also on armor stands in taiga village outdoor armory. Zombies and skeletons (and their variants) have a small chance to drop iron armor when killed. It can also be bought from armorer villagers. Iron boots can also be obtained by bartering.

You will get the advancement when you put one of the pieces of armor in your inventory.

Parent of: Not Today, Thank You

## Hot Stuff
Fill a bucket with lava

Requirements: Have a lava bucket in your inventory.

Empty buckets can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Iron Ingot  |                 |

Buckets can also be found in chests in savanna village houses, monster rooms, and woodland mansions. Water buckets can also be found in village fisherman's houses. Bucket of aquatic mobs can also bought from novice-level fisherman villagers and from wandering traders: you have to empty those first to use them.

Now, all you have to do is find lava and use your bucket to fill it up. Lava lakes can be found rarely on the surface in the Overworld, and sometimes underground above Y=0. They often light the surrounding grass and trees on fire, which makes them easy to spot from a distance, especially at night. However, lava is most common at Y=-55 and below, where it fills all of the caves in place of air. If you are in the Nether, getting lava should be very easy because it is found in the lava sea there. If you are high up in the Nether, getting down to the lava ocean could be quite difficult though. Lava can also generate as a spring block in both Overworld and the Nether, or spawn in village blacksmiths, ruined portals, nether fortresses, bastions, woodland mansions, strongholds and deltas.

Note that you have to use the bucket on the source of lava. Normally, if the lava you see is not flowing, you can use the bucket anywhere, because every block of lava is a source block; but if you see a stream of flowing lava, you have to trace the lava flow to its source, and use the bucket on it.

Parent of: Ice Bucket Challenge

## 
Upgrade your pickaxe

Requirements: Have an iron pickaxe in your inventory.

Iron pickaxe can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients           | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Iron Ingot+<br/>Stick |                 |

Iron pickaxes can also spawn in mineshafts, villages (blacksmiths and toolsmith's chests) and end cities. Iron pickaxe can also be bought from journeyman-level toolsmith villagers.

Parent of: Diamonds!

## 
Deflect a projectile with a shield

Requirements: Block an incoming projectile using a shield.

Shield can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients               | Crafting recipe |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| AnyPlanks+<br/>Iron Ingot |                 |

Shields can be also bought from journeyman level armorer villagers. 

Then, you need to find a skeleton, a pillager, a stray, a shulker, a blaze, a drowned with a trident, another player to help you, or anything else that fires projectiles. Have the shield in either hand and hold use, then let the projectile shoot toward you. The shield should block it (except if an arrow was shot from a crossbow with Piercing), therefore rewarding you the advancement.

## 
Acquire diamonds

Requirements: Have a diamond in your inventory.

You can either find a diamond ore underground, or look in various loot chests to find diamonds directly. 

Diamond ores are very rare, but by either branch mining deep down in the world or exploring caves that go very low, you will eventually find one. Diamond ore generate below level 15, most commonly around Y = -58. Mine it with your iron pickaxe, and collect the dropped diamond.

Diamonds can also spawn in village (blacksmiths, toolsmith's houses), shipwrecks, desert temples, jungle pyramids, mineshafts, buried treasures and end cities. Blocks of diamond can also rarely generate in woodland mansions, which you can turn into 9 diamonds.

| Ingredients      | Crafting recipe |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Block of Diamond | 9               |

You can also use a brush to excavate diamonds out of some blocks of suspicious sand that spawns in desert temples.

## Ice Bucket Challenge
Obtain a block of obsidian

Requirements: Have an obsidian block in your inventory.

You can either mine the obsidian block or find it in item form. To mine it, you first need a diamond pickaxe. It can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients        | Crafting recipe |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Diamond+<br/>Stick |                 |

Diamond pickaxes can also spawn in chests in bastions and end cities.

A bucket of water might also be needed: find a water source and use it with a bucket.

Next, you need to find a lava lake (you cannot use flowing lava, since it will become cobblestone), either deep in a cave, on the surface, or inside of any structure that have lava (see Hot Stuff above), and pour the bucket of water next to the lava. The water should flow onto the lava, turning it into obsidian. If you find any naturally occurring obsidian, that works as well. Mine the obsidian with your diamond pickaxe, and pick it up. Note that this won't work in the Nether, since water vaporizes there.

Obsidian as a block also generates in ruined portals, woodland mansions, ocean ruins, end spikes, obsidian platform, and end ships.

Obsidian in item form can be found in chests in village blacksmiths, ruined portals, nether fortresss and bastions. It can also be obtained by bartering.

Parent of: We Need to Go Deeper

## We Need to Go Deeper
Build, light, and enter a Nether Portal

Requirements: Enter the Nether dimension.

You will need to build a nether portal, or find a ruined portal and fix it. To make a portal, you need at least 10 blocks of obsidian. Make your portal using the obsidian like so (build it upright, or else it will not work): 

|  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

If you find a ruined portal, you wouldn't need to build an entire portal frame on your own, but you do need to fix it up to be complete. Depending on how broken (and large) the ruined portal is, it might be easier or harder to fix it than to make your own. In order to fix a ruined portal, you need to mine any crying obsidian in the portal (except for the corners, because these don't count); a diamond pickaxe works best for that. Then complete the portal by placing regular obsidian in the gaps. There is a chest near the portal that may contain some obsidian to help you with this, but it's likely that you will have to get some on your own anyway. The chest also may contain a fire charge or flint and steel, which will light the portal, even if you can't fix the ruined portal and decide to make your own.

Now you need a way to light the portal to activate it. This could be a flint and steel or a fire charge. If you don't have either of these, you need to get an iron ingot and a piece of flint and place these anywhere in your 2×2 crafting grid to make a flint and steel.

| Ingredients           | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Iron Ingot+<br/>Flint |                 |

Flint has a 10% chance to drop when mining gravel if mined without Silk Touch. It can also generate in villages (fletcher's house) and ruined portal chests. Light your portal by using the flint and steel or fire charge on the top surface of one of the bottom obsidian blocks. You can also light the nether portal by placing lava next to flammable blocks, or through a lightning strike. (Note that for those methods to work, a fire block must appear inside of the frame). If the portal doesn't light up, make sure that it is complete and the correct size, does not contain any crying obsidian (only regular obsidian), and does not have blocks inside the frame, then try again. Your portal should now look like this:

|  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

Once you stand inside the portal for 4 seconds, you will be teleported to the Nether and you will get the advancement. If you are not prepared to go into the Nether, go back to the Overworld the moment you set foot in the Nether. To return, step out of the portal and step back in again.

## Cover Me With Diamonds
Diamond armor saves lives

Requirements: Have any type of diamond armor in your inventory.

Diamond armor can be crafted like so:

| Name               | Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|--------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Diamond Helmet     | Diamond     |                 |
| Diamond Chestplate | Diamond     |                 |
| Diamond Leggings   | Diamond     |                 |
| Diamond Boots      | Diamond     |                 |

Diamond armor can also spawn in bastions, end cities, woodland mansions, and ancient cities. It has a very small chance to drop when killing zombies, skeletons or their variants. It can also be bought from armorer villagers.

You will get the advancement when you put one of the pieces of armor in your inventory.

## Enchanter
Enchant an item at an Enchanting Table

Requirements: Enchant an item at an enchanting table.

First, craft an enchanting table:

| Ingredients                     | Crafting recipe |
|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| Book+<br/>Diamond+<br/>Obsidian |                 |

There are a few methods of obtaining books. First, you can craft them from leather and paper.

Leather drops from cows, mooshrooms, horses, donkeys, mules, llamas, trader llamas, hoglins, and some foxes (a fox can sometimes spawn holding a leather, which always drops upon death). It can also be obtained by fishing, bartering, or by crafting from 4 rabbit hide.

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Rabbit Hide |                 |

Sugar cane generates naturally near bodies of water—oceans, rivers or lakes. Paper can also generate in villages (cartographer's house), shipwrecks, and stronghold libraries. When you have enough materials, you can make a book.

| Name  | Ingredients        | Crafting recipe |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Paper | Sugar Cane         |                 |
| Book  | Paper+<br/>Leather |                 |

A bookshelf drops 3 books if broken without using Silk Touch. Bookshelves generate as a block in village library houses, woodland mansions, and stronghold libraries. Book can also be obtained by disenchanting an enchanted book at a grindstone. Finally, books can generate in village plains and desert houses, shipwrecks, stronghold libraries and ancient cities.

Now, when you have a book, you can make an enchanting table.

To enchant, you will need an enchantable tool, weapon, a piece of armor or another book. You will also need between 1 and 3 pieces of lapis lazuli, which can be found in ore form between levels -64 and 64, being much more common in underwater caves than in dry caves. Lapis can also be found in item form in desert village temples, mineshafts and shipwrecks. A block of lapis lazuli can rarely generate in a woodland mansion, which can be turned into 9 pieces of lapis lazuli.

| Ingredients           | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Block of Lapis Lazuli | 9               |

Also, make sure you have plenty of experience levels, as you will need them to enchant.

Place down the enchanting table and use it. Put lapis lazuli and your item of choice into two slots inside of the table, and select one of three enchant choices on the right. 

For more info about enchanting, see this page.

## Zombie Doctor
Weaken and then cure a Zombie Villager

Requirements: Turn a zombie villager into a villager.

You will need to find a zombie villager, put it under the Weakness effect and give it a golden apple (by facing the zombie and pressing the use key with a golden apple in your hand). This process is called curing. There are a few methods to do this.

The easiest one is to find an igloo with a basement. This place is designed specifically for the Zombie Doctor advancement. Igloo basements generate with all the key ingredients: a zombie villager in a cage, a splash potion of Weakness inside of the brewing stand, and a golden apple inside of the chest. Simply break one of the iron bars holding the zombie villager, splash it with the potion, and give it the golden apple. After a maximum of five minutes, zombie villager will be cured and you will be granted the advancement.

Alternatively, if you can't find any igloos with basements, you can get a brewing stand and brew the potion of Weakness yourself. You can either craft the stand or find it.

| Ingredients                        | Crafting recipe |
|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Blaze Rod+<br/>Anystone-tier block |                 |

To obtain a blaze rod, you need to kill a blaze (more info about that under the Into Fire advancement). Blaze rods are not only used to craft the brewing stand, but also as a fuel for it (just craft the blaze rod into blaze powder), so even if you find a stand, you still need blaze rods to fuel it up.

Besides igloos, brewing stands also generate as a block in villages (church) and end ships.

Next, to brew a splash potion of Weakness, you will need a fermented spider eye:

| Ingredients                               | Crafting recipe |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Brown Mushroom+<br/>Sugar+<br/>Spider Eye |                 |

Spider eye drops from killing spiders, cave spiders, and witches. It can also generate in desert temples. 

Sugar can be crafted from sugar cane or a honey bottle. It can also drop from witches. 

Brown mushrooms generate in caves of Overworld, on the surface in swamp, old growth taiga and mushroom fields biomes, and almost everywhere in the Nether. They also generate in woodland mansions. Brown mushrooms can also drop from brown mushroom blocks, which are a part of huge mushrooms.

Next, you need a water bottle. Use a glass bottle in the main hand or in the off hand on a water source block.

| Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Glass       | 3               |

Water bottles can be also obtained through fishing or bartering.

The following steps are performed in the brewing stand. For more information about brewing, see the pages "Potion" and "Brewing".

First, brew a normal potion of Weakness:

| Potion                             | Potion brewing recipe |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| <br/>Potion of Weakness<br/>(1:30) |                       |

To turn a potion of Weakness into a splash potion of Weakness, you need a piece of gunpowder, which drops from killing creepers, ghasts, or witches. Gunpowder also generates in dungeons, desert temples, shipwrecks and woodland mansions.

| Potion                                    | Potion brewing recipe |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| <br/>Splash potion of Weakness<br/>(1:30) |                       |

Witches also can throw splash potions of Weakness, if for some reason you can't go to the Nether. You can also shoot the zombie villager with an arrow of Weakness, but that's not recommended for multiple reasons: such arrows are hard to obtain, will hurt (and potentially kill) the zombie, and their effect lasts much shorter (1/8 of the time) than from the potion.

Next, get a golden apple. It can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients           | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Gold Ingot+<br/>Apple |                 |

Apples drop from oak leaves and dark oak leaves. Apples also generate in village plains houses and blacksmiths, bonus chests and strongholds. They can also be bought from apprentice-level farmer villagers.

Gold ingots can be obtained by smelting raw gold, gold ore or nether gold ore:

| Ingredients                                                                         | Smelting recipe |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Raw Goldor<br/>Gold Oreor<br/>Deepslate Gold Oreor<br/>Nether Gold Ore+<br/>Anyfuel |                 |

or by crafting them like so:

| Name       | Ingredients   | Crafting recipe |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Gold Ingot | Gold Nugget   |                 |
| Gold Ingot | Block of Gold | 9               |

Gold ingots also generate in village blacksmiths, toolsmith's and temple houses; dungeon,s mineshafts, buried treasures, bastions, desert temples, end cities, jungle pyramids, nether fortresss, ruined portals, shipwrecks, strongholds and woodland mansions.

Golden apples also generate in dungeons, mineshafts, bastions, desert temples, ancient cities, ruined portals, strongholds, ocean ruins and woodland mansions.

Zombie villagers spawn rarely as a variant of normal zombies. They also have a chance to spawn after a zombie kills a villager; it depends on difficulty of the game. To make sure that the zombie villager doesn't burn from sunlight, doesn't despawn and is not killed by an iron golem, it is recommended to trap the zombie villager and stay nearby during the process of curing.

After successfully trapping the zombie villager, splash it with potion of Weakness / shoot it with arrow of Weakness / make the witch splash it with its potion, and then give the zombie a golden apple. You will be granted the advancement once villager is cured, which takes up to 5 minutes.

## Eye Spy
Follow an Eye of Ender

Requirements: Enter a stronghold.

Strongholds can be found by using eyes of ender, which are crafted like so:

| Ingredients                   | Crafting recipe |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| Blaze Powder+<br/>Ender Pearl |                 |

Ender pearls can be obtained by killing endermen, bartering, trading with expert-level cleric villagers, or can be found in the "fake end portal" rooms of woodland mansions (but note that the chest here is trapped and will trigger TNT if opened!). A very feasible way to obtain ender pearls in early game is to find a warped forest biome in the Nether, and kill as many endermen there as possible. 

Blaze powder is crafted from blaze rods, which only drop from blazes (more info about that under the Into Fire advancement).

Although the player needs at most 12 eyes of ender to activate the End portal, a few additional ones are usually needed to find a stronghold. Around 16 eyes of ender in most cases should be enough for finding the portal and opening it, given that the player doesn't throw the eyes too often and lose too many of them before reaching the stronghold.

While being anywhere in Overworld (preferably on the surface), use to throw eyes of ender up in the air. Follow the direction in which they go. At some point, usually about 2000 blocks from coordinates (0,0), eyes will go down into the ground instead of up in the air. Dig in that spot, until you reach stone bricks, which is the beginning of the stronghold. Advancement will be granted as soon as you enter the stronghold.

For more tips on finding the stronghold, see this part of the tutorial on defeating the ender dragon.

Parent of: The End?

## 
Enter the End portal.

Requirements: Enter the End dimension.

Jump into an activated End portal. These are found in end portal rooms in strongholds. You will probably need to fill few eyes into the end portal frames to activate the portal and go to the End; all frames need to have an eye of ender in it. A maximum of 12 eyes of ender are needed. Ender pearls also spawn in stronghold chests, which can be turned into eyes of ender and used to fill the end portal. When you go to the End, you will get the advancement before the actual terrain loads.

Make sure you are prepared before going to the End, because the only way out is to either defeat the ender dragon, or die in the attempt to do so. See this tutorial for more help. In Hardcore mode, you must beat the ender dragon to go back, since you cannot respawn.
