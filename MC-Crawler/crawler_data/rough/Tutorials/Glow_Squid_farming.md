# Tutorials/Glow Squid farming
In Java Edition, schools of 2 to 4 glow squid spawn in water in complete darkness in the Overworld (except deep dark biome) below Y-level 30. Unlike most other aquatic mobs, they require no water or waterlogged blocks above or below their spawning space.

In Bedrock Edition, glow squid spawn anywhere where there's water underground, in schools of 2 to 4 (below a solid roof categorized as cave spawn, while squids are surface spawns) anywhere below Y=30.

## Killing mechanisms
Glow squids can be killed by asphyxiation if they get out of water. They can also be killed by fall damage or by entering lava. Guardians are hostile toward glow squid and will use lasers to kill them.

## Farm Designs
Note that this design only works if built below Y-level 30.
