# Add-on
Add-ons are the first step toward bringing customization to all editions of Minecraft and are officially supported by Mojang/Minecraft. They allow the addition of elements to the game through a combination of resource packs and behavior packs.[2] Mojang provides official Creator Documentation in order to assist the community.

Behavior packs can modify the content of the game with the ability to change entity behaviors, loot drops, spawn rules, items, recipes, and trade tables. Behavior packs can be used to alter existing content or even create new entities, blocks, and items. They are often used in conjunction with Resource packs to create unique experiences that wouldn't be possible in the base game.[3]

Previously, add-ons needed to be packaged with a world to be sold on the Minecraft Marketplace. However, as of February 2024, individual add-ons can now be sold separately on the Marketplace.[4] All Marketplace content is submitted by official Minecraft partners and is approved by the Minecraft Content Team. All purchased content instantly syncs to a player's Microsoft account unless they are not signed into your Xbox profile, in which case it is saved locally to the player's device.

In addition to the Marketplace, there are community websites dedicated to hosting community-made add-ons such as MCPEDL and ModBay with the former being the more popular of the two while the latter has fewer ads and as such may provide better experience for slower devices.
