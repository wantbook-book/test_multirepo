# Tutorials/Player versus Player
Player versus player, also known as PvP, refers to combat in Minecraft which involves players fighting other players in multiplayer. Whether fighting in teams or in one-on-one duels, this is a difficult skill to hone for many players.

This guide covers PvP in vanilla Minecraft, though it will acknowledge well-known server plugins.

## Important terms to remember
- Sprint Resetting: Ending and restarting your sprint after each KB hit to deal maximum KB.
- S-Tapping: After KB hitting your enemy, immediately press S to create some space between you and your foe
- Crit-chaining: Also known as crit spamming or critting out. It's the act of critting out an enemy multiple times without stopping.
- Jump Resetting: Jumping at the same time as getting hit, reducing the horizontal knockback you take significantly.
- Combo: A combo is done when you hit somebody 2 or more times without them being able to hit you back. There are many ways to do and hold a combo, but the most common and easiest way is by S-Tapping.
- Hit Selecting: KB hitting someone right after you get hit. Doing this reduces your horizontal velocity, reducing the knockback you take.
- Range Sense: A skill that takes time to learn. Its the ability to hit someone just at the edge of your 3 block range.
- Punish crit/P-crit/Revenge crit/counter crit: Critting your opponent after being hit by them, hitting them while falling after taking knockback from their hit. Very useful as you do not have to jump.
- Quickdrop/Dropping: Dying early in a fight due to a failure to heal yourself. Always to be avoided in PVP.
- Toteming: Offhanding a totem so that it pops and saves you from fatal moments. Only present in Crystal, SMP and Neth Pot.

## PVP Kits
- Axe and Shield PVP: A style of PVP where the main weapons used are axe. Kit includes a full unenchanted diamond armor, diamond axe and sword, 6 arrows, crossbow and bow, and a shield.
- Crystal PVP: A style of PVP that mainly uses end crystals and respawn anchors, and many totems of undying. Is much different from other PVP kits, barely using conventional weapons at all.
- Sword PVP: A style of PVP that uses only diamond armor and a diamond sword. Very reliant on quickness with PVP techniques and knowledge of maneuvers.
- Diamond Potion / Dia Pot: A kit with fully maxed out diamond armor, cooked beef, a fully maxed out sword without Fire Aspect II and a lot of Instant Health II, Strength II, Speed II and Regeneration II potions. It plays similarly to sword but mechanically very intensive and fast, as players mostly rely on using Healing Potions quickly to stay alive. LOKA is a special variant of Dia Pot featuring a 33% damage buff to all players, making fights a lot faster and more intense.
- Netherite Potion / Nethpot: A kit of PVP that has fully maxed netherite armor and sword, 64 golden apples, 2 stacks of XP bottles and a lot of Instant Health II, Strength and Speed II potions and Fire Resistance potions (8 minutes). Unlike Diamond Sword and Potion, this kit heavily relies on critting out your opponent.
- SMP Kit: A kit usually used in most SMPs where crystal PVP is illegal. It's similar to Netherite Pot but has ender pearls, 2 swords (one enchanted with KB 1) and healing pots are discarded. A shield and axe are also included in the kit and is more of a mix between Neth pot and UHC.
- UHC: A unique kit without natural regeneration. Players are armed with partially enchanted diamond armor, sword and axe, a few stacks of building blocks (usually cobblestone or planks), cobwebs, a few water and lava buckets, 13 golden apples, a bow and piercing crossbow (with arrows of course).

## Overview
PvP in Minecraft results in the death or injury of one or more players. When a player dies in normal difficulty, the contents of their inventory are scattered on the ground. This creates a powerful incentive for players to participate in PvP, as successfully killing another player rewards the killer with all of their items, and sometimes reputation and power too.

PvP can occur on any server where the admin has not set rules on it, or has allowed it. As some servers endorse building and adventuring cooperatively, while others are PvP-oriented, servers will usually have rules which dictate whether or not PvP is allowed. 

One such rule may be only allowing PvP in "war zones", which are designated areas of land wherein players are allowed to engage in combat. It is impossible for players to damage other players outside of these war zones. This type of rule may be in place to give players a safe area to restock on items or simply take a break from PvP.

## Equipment for PvP
A combatant's equipment is a deciding factor in PvP, increasing one's survivability and damage output. Having good gear does not guarantee you success though, because skill is arguably a more important factor. Good gear can, however, greatly boost your chances in a fight. Players should be familiar with all aspects of equipment in order to effectively utilize them and assess the gear of their enemies'.

| Sword              | The sword is the most common and basic weapon for melee combat. The range of a sword is up to 3 blocks, making it the go to option for attacking other players in close proximity. A diamond sword enchanted withSharpnessV is capable of killing a player in unenchanted diamond armor in just 4 critical hits. However, the newly added netherite weapons deal exactly half a heart more of raw damage than their diamond counterparts. The sword deals far more damage per second than theaxe, and slightly higher knockback than other melee weapons, making it arguably the most effective. Swords also have the ability to perform a sweep attack‌[Java Edition  only], knocking back and slightly damaging other opponents near the initial hit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Axe                | The axe deals slightly more damage per hit than thesword‌[Java Edition  only]and can temporarily disableshields, but it has a slower attack speed. Despite these drawbacks, axes are effective weapons in PvP.‌[Java Edition  only]A critical strike with an unenchanted stone axe or better deals 9 hearts of damage to an unarmored player, 4.5 hearts of damage to a player with unenchanted iron armor, and 2 hearts to a player with unenchanted diamond armor. This means it can kill a full iron player in just 3 hits, and a full diamond player in 5 hits. If you're fighting an enemy in iron, keep in mind that you don't have to critical the third strike unless if they're trying to eat up, as they would have only 1 heart left after the second hit. Even if a sword can deal more damage, axes will always have a use in disabling shields.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Trident            | The trident is a versatile but, overall, poor weapon. It can be used for melee and distance combat, but best as a utility item. Once thrown, they do not slow down while underwater. They are best enchanted with Loyalty and Impaling. The other enchantments have their uses too, however. With Riptide, one can essentially fly with a source of water or rain. With Channeling, one can summon lightning to the trident's target during thunderstorms, exposing them and can also be used to make charged creepers, zombie pigmen, or witches. However, aside enchantments, they are somewhat lackluster as a weapon. They deal less damage than most axes but cannot disable shields, and attack too slowly to be used like swords.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Bow                | A fully charged bow not only deals more damage than adiamond sword, dealing 9despite attacking slower but it can also shoot up to 64 blocks upward, making it a powerful weapon from long range. Despite these advantages, a bow should not be used at close range as it has a 0.9-second charge time. The bows greatest drawback is that a shield will counter a bow in most scenarios as they can safely advance while holding it up. A well-enchanted bow is still recommended for high-level PvP as it can be used to pressure distant opponents and drain them of health and armor durability. By using tippedarrows, bows can also be used to inflict effects on players, such asPoisonon enemies. Arrow trajectories are affected by your motion in versions Java 1.9 and higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Crossbow           | The crossbow can be used like a bow shot with no charge time if pre-loaded. It deals 12 damage points, but keep in mind that it takes 3 seconds to reload and can't be enchanted with power, and in conditions when the other player(s) can see you, crossbows will put you at a disadvantage, because an ordinary bow has a shorter charging time than the reload rate of a crossbow. Enchanting a crossbow withQuick ChargeIII gives it the same charge time as a bow, greatly increasing its potential in PvP. It features its own enchantments and a slower recharge time then the bow and can shootfireworks. The maximum damage inflicted by its projectiles is 11× 5.5, and with the enchantmentMultishotit can shoot 3 at once. The player can alternatively use it as a weapon for sniping. If you shoot fireworks from crossbow with Multishot, it will deal 18 splash damage. However a crossbow with aPiercingis effective in combat as well, because the arrow goes through entities and bypasses shields, rendering the main defence against ranged weapons completely useless. In PVP crossbows are best used for their instant knockback potential, as even with multishot, harming arrows and fireworks, their damage against Protection 4 armor is minimal, making melee weapons far more deadly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Armor              | Armor allows players to absorb some of the damage dealt to them. Armor is vital for PvP and most players will die in seconds without it.Protectionis usually the ideal enchantment for armor built for combat purposes. However, it is not as specialized as some other enchantments, such asFire ProtectionandBlast Protection. These threats may prove more prominent than typical damage sources and are something to keep in mind when enchanting your armor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Shield             | Shields can be used to block incoming attacks. Upon a successful block, shields negate damage and knockback from both melee attacks and ranged attacks.Arrowsandtridentsblocked by a shield may ricochet off onto nearby blocks or entities. If hit by anaxe, the shield will be disabled for 5 seconds.‌[Java Edition  only]Shields become obsolete if they break or are fired through with a piercing Crossbow. Shields have a delay of about 0.5 seconds before they become active when used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Food               | A combatant should make sure they have a fullhungerbar during a fight. If hunger goes below18 ( × 9), their health won't regenerate, and if hunger dips below6 (), sprinting is impossible. It is recommended to eat cooked food, such assteakorcooked porkchops, as they refill more hunger points than their raw counterparts. If possible, eat agolden apple, as it grants temporaryRegenerationandAbsorption. Foods preferred for saturation once an golden apple is consumed are usually suspicious stew or golden carrots, because they provide good saturation and allow you to be unaffected by some damage in battle. This is because the rate of regeneration is much faster with a full hunger bar and saturation to spare.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Blocks             | Blocks are useful to obstruct the path of enemies or to create an escape path. They can be especially useful in tight spaces as you can block a pursuer, buying you time to escape. Blocks can also be used to pillar up walls or other heights to reach safety. Watch out for projectiles that can knock you off! There are many different types of blocks, some with unique uses, such as good blast resistance or inflammability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Potion             | Potions apply a variety of usefuleffects. These effects can strengthen allies and harm enemies when thrown assplash potions. In addition,lingering potionsallow for a larger potion radius, at of cost of it being a more expensive potion.Strength,Speed,Fire Resistance,Regeneration, andPoisonare some of the best potions to have in your arsenal. Note that drinking a regular potion takes some time and may cause you to become vulnerable. That is why splash potions are used more often by some players. However, splash potions have the disadvantage of shorter effect durations, as well as the possibility of accidentally sharing the effect with nearby opponents. To get the maximum duration of a splash potion effect, throw the potion so that it lands directly on your head. If that isn't practical at the moment, simply splash it at your feet, as forward-splashing methods don't work in recent versions. Lingering potions are useful for either making an area inaccessible for a while or allowing everyone in a team to heal together. However lingering potions often cause huge lag and are expensive, so they aren't widely used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Ender Pearl        | When thrown, it teleports the user to the location it lands. This is useful for healing, chasing, or escaping dangerous situations. Note that ender pearls inflict damage to the player on use. You can hit someone with a pearl as they are escaping, allowing you to instantly catch up to them. Some players will pearl to the side or behind the opponent's back. In some terrains like a steep cliff or the nether, one must throw it carefully or risk taking heavy fall damage. If you hit your opponent with it, they will take minor knockback.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Water Bucket       | Water slows movement, buying more time to escape. It can also be used to avoid taking fall damage, putting out fires, and traveling up walls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Lava Bucket        | Lava is the ultimate barricade. You can use lava to greatly slow your enemies or heavily damage them (allowing it to be used in traps) if they don't have potions or enchantments to protect themselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Horse              | Horses give riders a speed advantage, which is particularly useful in a chase, an escape, or in dodging ranged attacks through strafing. Horses can also be used to reach high places through their ability to jump multiple blocks in one leap. When you get hit while on a horse you won't be knocked back and falling damage will also be reduced. Beware when around water as a horse cannot swim in water more than two blocks deep. Make sure to use horse armor and additional food to heal the horse, and maybe a lead to control the horse in obstructive terrain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Redstone           | In the right hands, redstone forms the foundation for effectivetrapsand some weapons, such asTNT cannons. Building a trap in a strategic location and luring the opponent into it can be an easy way to win a fight. However, constructing traps or weaponry in the middle of a fight is highly impractical, and thus redstone constructs are best used with the element of surprise or at the start of a fight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| End Crystal        | If used properly, end crystals can be lethal to the opponent.  To use End Crystals effectively, the attacker must protect their lower hitbox, as the upper half of a player's hitbox does not take much damage from explosions. This effect is partially done with the obsidian required to place the crystal, which protects your legs and allows you to use them in relative safety as long as your armor is good enough. On hard difficulty, a single End Crystal explosion can instantly kill a full Protection IV diamond armor player if they are within four blocks of and have their feet on the same Y-level as the crystal. On normal difficulty, a point-blank end crystal explosion can take said diamond armor player down to half a heart. However, end crystals are hard to get as they require valuable items to craft, and as a result are only used in endgame PvP and on servers with custom kits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Bed                | If you are fighting in the Nether or the End beds are a cheaper substitute to end crystals, and they are easier to place as they don't have to be placed on obsidian. Right-click on a bed in the Nether or End to explode it, leaving behind a sizeable crater and tons of fire. Try to stand on a block that is at least one block lower than where you are going to detonate the bed, or placing one block between you and the bed before exploding it, as this would protect your lower hitbox from the explosion damage, which is much more effective on the bottom half of your hitbox. If you really want to be safe, drink a fire resistance potion and have some of your armor enchanted with blast protection IV. However, beds could simply be used to suicide-bomb (or feign suicide-bombing) somebody who ambushed you, which is always better than losing your items to an enemy. With some more TNT and careful planning, one can create devastating explosions. The main disadvantage of beds is their volatile nature and the fact that they do not stack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Respawn Anchor     | Essentially the Nether variant of a bed. Although expensive, it is still much quicker and easier to place and detonate than an end crystal, and more convenient than a bed, since it can stack up to 64, meaning that it would only take up two slots in your inventory for a full stack of bombs. It's more versatile than an end crystal as it can hurt foes below it, while foes under an end crystal would be shielded from the block of obsidian or bedrock used to place the crystal on, which takes far too long to remove in a fight. The drawbacks compared to end crystals is that it has slightly less damage, and while easier to detonate singularly, it's a lot harder and slower to detonate respawn anchors safely and repeatedly and still do good damage, due to its nature of leaving craters and the fact that you have to swap to glowstone and out of it to detonate each one since it can only explode when charged with glowstone. It's also the most expensive out of the three items and are even harder to farm than end crystals. (crying obsidian is rare and the only renewable source of it, bartering, is both inconsistent and slow.) A typical endgame loadout would have both end crystals and respawn anchors/glowstone as explosive weapons, although there are exceptions. For example, if a server's difficulty is set to Easy, the explosion damage, which scales with difficulty, would no longer be sufficient enough for such weapons to be worth carrying as at that point, regular melee or bow would do similar damage without the risk of taking hefty recoil damage yourself. |
| TNT                | TNT can be used to buildtrapsor to distract and scare the opponent. With activator rails, TNT minecarts can also be used. Explosions also destroys items making it useful to render your opponents helpless if they are caught in an explosion. On some servers, notably the ones with minigames, TNT can be used as an explosive boost to launch players across a huge gap, allowing them to get to enemies on the other side and eliminating the danger of building across the void and getting knocked off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Flint and Steel    | Flint and steel can be used to distract enemies and alter the battlefield by setting surfaces onfire, forcing players to escape or avoid the area. Additionally, the flame effect incurred from being on fire obstructs a player's field of view, limiting their ability to perceive incoming threats. Be aware that the flint and steel has a low durability and won't do much harm to a skilled player.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Fire charges       | Fire charges can be fired from dispensers as a trap, or used on a block to set it alight.

| Totem of Undying   | When held in the offhand, this will protect the player from a lethal hit (except from the void and the /kill command) and grant them temporary regeneration and absorption. Often used in endgame PvP or in servers with custom kits, these items are great options to prevent death in a dangerous situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

However, bear in mind that wolves have low health and that they are easily killed by a skilled player.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Elytra             | The elytra can be used to travel long distances at high speed, surprise attack enemies, and fly into their base. Wearing elytra drastically and dangerously reduces the user's defense due to taking up the chestplate slot. It is best to enchant your elytra with Unbreaking and have a supply of phantom membranes to repair it. Often one will use elytra with a trident to save fireworks. In a ground battle, swapping the elytra for a chestplate is highly recommended. As a method of escape, however, they are extremely powerful, especially if combined with Fireworks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Fireworks          | Fireworks can be used to boost an elytra's speed and damage enemies under a ceiling. They can also act as signals to teammates.

| Shears             | These can disarm tripwire traps without triggering them, and destroy certain blocks such as leaves and cobwebs quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Cobwebs            | Cobwebs slow any player caught in it to a crawl, which is great for making distance between you and your foe, or to trap them and make them easy targets. They can also prevent fall damage and knockback, which can be helpful in some situations, and you can intentionally stick one on your feet if your enemy is relying heavily on the latter. By jumping into it in pre-1.9 versions, a player can score multiple critical hits easily as it slows your descent while you're in it. However, it's important to know that being stuck in a cobweb while the adversary isn't gives them a lot more options than the webbed player does, such as planting lava or detonating explosives to burn or obliterate the stuck player while they skedaddle to safety. Therefore, if you often use cobwebs defensively or know your enemy uses them, it is imperative that you have a way to recover from said webs without taking hefty punishment. Bringing ender pearls allows you to escape from cobwebs quickly when needed. Water buckets also melt them away, but the time it takes for a player to use the bucket or the pearls usually means a couple of free hits for their foe. In such an instance, pearls work better than buckets as you're going to take damage while pearling anyways, and the enemy hit usually just negates said pearl damage.

| Fire AspectandFlame   | Deals fire damage, higher levels makes it last longer.                                                                                                                | Used on: Sword (Fire Aspect), Bow (Flame)                                   | Fire damage isn't affected by armor, but Fire Protection will lessen the damage. So, these enchantments are not always reliable: don't solely depend on them working with someone who hasFire Resistancepotions or fully enchanted armor as they may be immune. Fire may also be used to expose opponents in dark areas, as well as obstructing their view. However, if you combine Fire Aspect with Sharpness, your opponent would quickly be stuck in a catch-22 situation; If they have fire protection, Sharpness V + Strength II potions would make quick work of them in a few hits. If they don't have fire protection, they'll take significant burn damage every time you hit them, and force them to carry fire resistance potions which takes up valuable inventory space. One of the major drawbacks of fire aspect is that sometimes the fire tick gets in the way of their knockback (Players are immune to knockback for up to 0.5 seconds after taking damage in Java Edition, and on Bedrock Edition, they're immune to both knockback and further damage in that frame.) which makes them more difficult to get off you in a pinch, and could result in you taking more damage than the enemy if you aren't careful with distancing. |
| SharpnessandPower     | Deals a flat amount of extra damage (Sharpness) or an additional percentage of damage (Power). Higher levels increase said bonus damage.                              | Sword (Sharpness), Bow (Power)                                              | Sharpness increases damage dealt by 1.25 per level of enchantment (pre-1.9 Java and in Bedrock Edition)As of the 1.9 Combat Update (Java Edition), this value has changed to an additional 1 damage for Sharpness I and another 0.5 for each level of Sharpness after that, up to a maximum of +3 damage for Sharpness V.Power increases your bow damage by 50% for Power I and an additional 25% for each level after that, up to a maximum of +150% for Power V. Please note that the bow, at full charge, may randomly cause extra damage.A common misconception is that enchantments cause a random amount of extra damage. This is NOT TRUE. Enchantments increase your damage by a flat amount for the sword, and a percentage for the bow. The problem is that the bow itself does damage randomly at full charge, and the difference of damage is a lot clearer with the 150% bonus at Power V than with an unenchanted bow, and ends up creating the confusion that the enchantments are to blame for this random damage, while the reality is that the Power enchantment scales off the bow's inherently random damage, but it's not random in itself.                                                                                       |
| Thorns                | Wearer has a chance to reflect taken damage back at the opponent at the cost of durability. Higher levels offer a greater chance to reflect damage.                   | For anyarmor.                                                               | (pre-1.16.2) Be wary of the extra durability damage your armor takes, as armor used to take double the durability damage If you use Thorns, so your armor will quickly break unless you also useUnbreaking. After 1.16.2, Thorns only does durability damage to armor if the effect activates, making it a lot more durable than previous versions. Even with Unbreaking 3, be very careful about using this enchantment as taking excess damage to your armor is dangerous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| KnockbackandPunch     | Knocks target back farther. Higher levels will increase distance.                                                                                                     | Sword (Knockback), Bow (Punch)                                              | Both of these enchantments aren't well liked by the community. However, in some cases, both of them can be lifesavers. Punch can knock back enemies especially in sticky situations, so even if you launched a weak bow shot, it can push your assailants far enough for you to recover. Meanwhile, Knockback I is useful in Netherite PVP especially when attempting to combo. Since netherite armor has a natural knockback resistance, it's hard to knock away your opponents in this kit, but with Knockback I, the KB resistance is nullified by the enchantment, allowing players to finally combo people to death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Protection            | Absorbs a certain percentage of all damage depending on the level.                                                                                                    | For anyarmor.                                                               | This is one of the best enchantments for armor as a full set of Protection IV can reduce damage additionally for another 64% on Java, and 80% on Bedrock. (seearmor) A full set of Protection IV is the best choice for "Protection-related" enchantments on Bedrock, and will be the best in most situations on Java, sans the explosive-based endgame combat on hardmode servers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Blast Protection      | Absorbs a certain percentage ofexplosiondamage depending on the level.                                                                                                | For anyarmor.                                                               | One piece of Blast Protection IV armor and 3 pieces of Protection IV will protect against the deadliest threats on higher difficulties, such as Creepers, TNT minecarts, or End crystals. It is most useful on hard difficulty where explosion damage is a serious threat and smart players may try to look for positions to blow you up instead of stabbing you to death. (Dear Notch, that was awful phrasing. Forgive me.) It also protects against fireworks, so if someone is spamming 7 layered fireworks at you with a Multishot Quick Charge III Crossbow, you'd be in a much better state with a piece of Blast Protection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Fire Protection       | Absorbs a certain percentage offiredamage depending on the level, and reduces the duration that you'll be on fire for after being ignited.                            | For anyarmor.                                                               | Having one armor piece with Fire Protection is a good idea in some situations such as in the Nether where items like flint and steel and lava buckets are common weapons. However, putting fire protection prevents you from putting other forms of protection on your armor, which may become a problem in most forms of PVP, when you would have fire resistance potions rendering fire protection armor obselete, and you'd be taking significant extra damage since fire protection doesn't protect against much more dangerous threats like harming arrows, strength II axe crits, or end crystals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Projectile Protection | Absorbs a certain percentage of projectile damage depending on the level.                                                                                             | For anyarmor.                                                               | This is effective against opponents who choose to snipe and bow spam you, but like Fire Protection significantly harms your melee prowess. It can also be helpful againstdispensersas they can firearrowsquickly. Note that this only protects from theimpactof the projectile, not any effects that come with it, e.g. fire from afire chargeor potion effects from a tipped arrow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Feather Falling       | Absorbs a certain percentage offall damage, including damage fromender pearlsand crash damage while gliding with the Elytra.                                          | Boots only.                                                                 | If you frequently use ender pearls to engage or escape or have the tendency to do oopsies with the elytra, this enchant will prove invaluable to you. It's always a good safety net to have, in fact, as you never know when you'll make a mistake and fall a large distance. It can also coexist with protection on boots, so you don't need to make the horrible decision of "this or that?" Note that even though the damage is negated and the enchant is called feather falling, the fall damage sound remains, potentially alerting your enemies to your presence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

This should be the enchantment of choice when fighting underwater.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

This enchantment allows you to engage and escape much faster in a naval battle, and will give you an easy advantage if you combine its mobility bonus with placement of water buckets, as you'll wade through the water faster than your enemy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Infinity              | Fire unlimited regular arrows, but at least one must be in your inventory.                                                                                            | Forbow.                                                                     | Infinity is a good enchantment for spamming lots ofarrows. This is well paired withUnbreaking, as the number of arrows that can be fired in total is increased. Keep in mind that it doesn't allow you to fire infinite tipped arrows, so if you're using tipped arrows to fight, it's much better to have a bow with mending which can be reused, or a Crossbow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Settings
It's important to determine the best settings for you. Settings don't improve your fighting skill rather they make your fights more comfortable. Its discouraged to constantly change your settings to try to find the "perfect" setting that will magically make you the best. Get settings that don't limit your gameplay and get skilled with them.

Having more FPS is incredibly important if you have a low-end system. Tone down most of your graphics, such as setting it to "Fast", turning down your render distance, and turning your FPS cap to unlimited are some examples that can somewhat improve your FPS.

Next are your controls. First, modifying your keybinds is totally up to you. Using the default 1-9 isn't recommended, as the numbers past 4 or 5 are inconvenient to reach. Some good keybinds are 1-4, z, x, c, r, f, q, capslock, and mouse buttons if possible. Although using the scroll wheel in your mouse can be helpful, keybinds are faster and more accurate than using the scroll wheel if you become good with your keybinds. Your mouse sensitivity is also dependent on each player and choosing one that you're comfortable with is essential with getting better aim. With a high sensitivity, your crosshair would start becoming shaky and you won't accurately track your opponent as your mouse is too fast, while if your sensitivitiy is too low, your rotation is too slow, thus you won't be able to track your opponent that moves too much and too fast. Other settings to change are turning Auto-jump to off and turning your sprint to "Toggle".

An ideal FOV is any FOV above 80-85, letting you see enough so that enemies can't strafe behind you easily but not making opponents too small if they are at the edge of your reach. Its best to turn off FOV effects as well as Damage Tilt completely, as they cause your screen to warp and shake during fights and make aim much harder.

Texture packs or resource packs (whatever you call them) are optional but sometimes they make your PVP experience more comfortable. Beware of claims that PVP texture packs that some youtubers say will make you better are false, they don't make you better, they just make your experience better. Some vanilla textures in the game obstruct your vision too much, such as food, explosion particles, swords, fire, and offhand items, so texture packs reducing the size of those are definitely recommended.

Utility mods are useful in combat, as well as performance-enhancing mods. InventoryHUD tells you your armor durability, potion timers and what your inventory has, along with other useful information including how many arrows do you have. Health indicators are not always allowed on every server so it's best to check before installing one. Sodium and OptiFine are the two best FPS enhancing mods, although OptiFine isn't compatible with Fabric mods unless you download OptiFabric, which allows you to use OptiFine and other fabric mods simultaneously (do note to that OptiFine and Sodium aren't compatible even with OptiFabric). Appleskin is a mod which tells you your saturation which is important in healing (more about that later) and is available with both Forge and Fabric versions. Custom Crosshair Mod customizes your crosshair, and it would change the color of your crosshair once a mob is within your reach, allowing you to time your hits better. There are more mods out there to improve your experience in PvP, but these are some of the more popular ones.

## Locations of PvP
In PvP, the fighters will have to fight in some setting, whether it be a custom-designed arena, normal terrain, or in a challenge map.

### Normal terrain
This is when two players fight in the naturally generated terrain of Minecraft. In this type of fight, players decide on a designated area or may be unexpectedly attacked (underground, caves, cliffs, or strongholds). One can also add custom features into the natural terrain, normally player-built structures.

### Custom-built terrain
This is PvP that takes place in a unique area or challenge map. Players that are friends may decide to create or use a challenge map that facilitates PvP. The players may choose to divide themselves into multiple groups, enjoy a free-for-all, or any other distribution of players that fight among one another.

Players may prefer to build an arena for the sake of organization or aesthetics.

#### Types of arena
- Spawn: Many servers have a PvP area at spawn or even around it! Be warned though, because you usually can't place or break blocks.
- Vanilla: PVP out in the wilderness of naturally generated terrain!
- Ancient: Build a Colosseum inspired by the ancient Romans with fights against animals and perhaps some blood (redstone) on the floor — use stone or different kinds of stone brick for walls, grass or sand as the floor, andwoodfor decoration and breaking the stone  up.
- Survival games: A huge arena that's in a dome and often has multiple biomes incorporated into it. The walls must be obsidian, bedrock or barrier. Supporters and spectators can send in messengers with food, armor etc. The battle goes on until there is a last player standing!
- Multi-leveled: Have several floors on the arena with random holes; make sure the sides are made ofglassso spectators can see all the gravitational action.
- Spleef Twist: Who says you have to do the dirty work? Let lava below the map do it for you (tell combatants before the match to avoid having to pay compensation)! Run around stabbing your opponent while removing the floor from beneath their feet.
- Bridge: Players attempt to cross a narrow bridge, killing enemies and/or scoring points at the other side. Players can hit their opponents using eggs, snowballs, bows, snow golems, etc. until they fall through the void or the lava, To defend yourself from falling use shields, pearls and some blocks.
- Bedrock formations:This area is just made out of bedrock formations, it makes PvP a lot more interesting and makes movements more challenging. It is usually used for Crystal PvP.

### How to Deal With Terrain
#### Physical Terrain
- Inclines:Inclines are hills and slopes that spawn naturally all over the vanilla world, where the terrain moves up by a block every couple blocks or so. It's important to be able to play around them since most practice servers dont have them. If your opponent is ever trying to move up an incline by jumping up one block, hit them just before they jump. This suspends them in the air and prevents them from jumping, making them weirdly stuck. You can and should do this repeatedly.
	- Lower Ground:Usually in PVP you want to keep the lower ground. Because your head is lower than their, you can hit them from further away, an effect that is made even more extreme if you crouch. Try to use KB hits to hold them back so that they can't get to the same level as you. If they do, just drop back another level to keep the low ground.
	- Higher Ground:Having the higher ground makes it much more difficult for enemies to chase you uphill, and lets you hit them away from you further. It's very easy for you to rush them by no-KB critting towards them, as your fall will be extra long, giving you a longer window where KB hits are inefficient. Additionally, by stepping off of a ledge, you can get a critical hit without having to jump, which requires fairly precise timing but is very strong if you can pull it off fluidly.
- Walls:Walls can be a cave wall you're in, a steep slope nearby, or a tree you've wandered in nearby. All of them force the fight to be closer range and put cobwebs in the spotlight, making Headwebs available on every hit.
	- Playing Against a Wall:Being backed up against a wall in a fight certainly... doesn't sound ideal, but considering it, your only two disadvantages are that you can't run and you can be headwebbed easily. If your opponent likes to headweb you, treat a wall like a hazard and stay away from it. If you are pushed into a wall, put a block above your head so they can't headweb you, or pre-water the wall. If headwebs aren't such a big concern, then as long as you aren't at an HP disadvantage and need to run, walls are pretty good! You take no knockback if you get hit into a wall, meaning that you can crit or pcrit your opponent to no end.
	- Pushing Your Opponent Into a Wall:Crit them out, since you won't be able to deal knockback anyway. Your goal is to drop them and make it akward and in the end, costly or impossible for them to escape and heal. The only exception is if you also have the low ground: if they can't run and can't advance past your KB hits, they will be trapped in a position where they have lower reach. And finally, headweb them whenever you think you can. It's okay to preplace the web and then hit them into it if they aren't moving them from their spot.

#### Hazards
A hazard is any area that's dangerous or disadvantageous to be. Most likely its a lava pool, ravine opening, or for a particularly experienced player, even just a wall that's easy to headweb against. In any case, both players want to stay away from it and force the other player into it. When playing around a hazard, strafe around your opponent constantly and stay low to the ground, letting you move more effectively to put them inbetween you and the hazard. Whether you're successful or not, you'll need to push your opponent back and gain ground. To do this, disable their shield and don't let yours be disabled, at all costs. Use techniques like Shoving to advance forwards consistently without taking much knockback or Uppercutting to gain lots of ground very quickly. If your opponent crits you, Sidesweeps are a viable option (only if you're losing) to run around behind them and flip the scenario on them.

- Cliffs and Holes:The goal with these is always to hit your opponent over the edge, making them stack or water back up to you and possibly take fall damage. Feather Falling reduces your fall damage down to 20%, making cliffs not a danger but just a piece of terrain that's one way. When your opponent attempts to come back up, use this opportunity to KB hit them back off and force them to waste lots of time and resources to come back up to you. Also not a bad time to use a punch bow, which especially helps drain their armor.

- Water Pools:Water pools that spawn in plain biomes or the like are a mixed bag. Being in one prevents you from critting/jumping and slows you significantly, basically trapping you. However, while in one, you have the lower ground and are immune to lava/webs. If in a water pool, dig down one block and enter Swimming Mode, making you fast and making your hitbox comically low and small. Essentially get KB hits past their shield and come out ahead in damage, then safely exit the pool once they heal. If you are pushing somebody in a water pool, get very close and place blocks below you to allow you to continue to crit them.

- Lava Pools:If both players have Fire resistance, treat a lava pool as a water pool where you can't swim. Lava pools massively slow and damage the player in them and due to the constant damage ticks make it hard to swim out of them. If your opponent is in a lava pool, try to keep them in the pool and don't take too many hits; let the lava kill them. Place blocks on edges where they are attempting to swim out.

- Mobs:Most mobs don't do enough damage to be important in PVP, but you can still let them do some work for you. During the nighttime, notice if a spider, skeleton or creeper has aggroed on your opponent. If so, play passive with shield and continually hit them away until they're eventually forced to distract themselves with killing the mob. Simply run intil out of range if a mob decides to attack you.

#### Rivers and Oceans
Entering a river or ocean to heal is often a good option. Water makes fire, lava, and cobwebs impossible to use, prevents critical hits, and shrinks your hitbox, making offensive play difficult. Having Depth Strider on your boots is essential for this, otherwise they will easly catch up to you and hit you. Also note if either player has Respiration, since if not, you can keep track of their air bubbles and go under to heal when they need to surface.

## Types of PvP
This is an overview of various types of PvP. Further sections may take this into greater detail.

### Friendly PvP
Friendly PvP is when two or more players agree to PvP for friendly practice and training ONLY. Friendly PvP is great to play on LAN. It is the least hostile option for PvP as it:

- Avoids grudges.
- Stops property loss from thieving player drops.
- Encourages cooperation.
- Allows players to use any type of weapon without worry

### Organized PvP
In organized PvP, players agree on the circumstances of their fight, and then battle. The victor may be agreed to receive anything, from diamonds and emeralds to proven superiority to nothing at all.

This type of PvP can be highly competitive and players may need an impartial judge to enforce the rules.

### Unorganized PvP
This is when someone surprise attacks you without warning. Keep your weapons ready for this! This is mainly common in SMP PVP. 

If you have better equipment than your attacker, you will likely be able to kill them. At this point, there is no better time to give it your all. Utilize anything and everything at your disposal to destroy your opponent — any method that Minecraft provides, you should exploit. (Combat-logging, hacking, and other out-of-game methods are unacceptable except on select servers.) Always carry extras. You never want to be stuck in battle without a weapon. Therefore, extensive measures must be taken to ensure that equipment can be readily replaced in a fight, such as enchantments, extras, and consistent resupplying.

Press any advantages you can, and consider fleeing if you don't think you can win. There's little point in being honourable, and more point to staying alive.

If someone intervenes in your fight, and attacks the enemy, then you and the new fighter can kill the enemy. When that is finished, then you will fight the new opponent and possibly lose. Also, you may have a chance to "clean up" the player that won the fight between the 2 when they are low on health, or to escape while they fight. This is also known as "third-partying", or "janitor-ing".

### Kit PvP
In this type, 2 players spawn in a set map with an arranged set of equipment, thus the name of PVP. Practicing kits are important in learning the basics of PVP. And the kits can also be customizable depending on the server.

In 1.16+ versions, the most important kits to practice are SMP kit, netherite pot kit PVP and crystal PVP.

### Minigames
Minigames are typically played on dedicated minigame servers. Some popular ones include Bedwars (where each player/team has a bed that allows them to respawn if it is undestroyed), and Capture the Flag (where each team tries to steal a banner/wool from the other team). Many other variations of these games, and some more niche minigames, also exist. Each minigame will typically have its own set of rules, as well as a shop or class system (although this is not true for all minigames). To gain experience in this kind of PvP, it is recommended to try different kinds of minigames, and find one/some that you enjoy. Minigames are technically a form of Organized PvP, but are normally on a dedicated server.

## Practice servers
Servers are a good way to sharpen your PVP skills. Listed below are some of the more  popular PVP servers.

- PVP Legacy is a PVP server hosted in North America. One of its biggest advantages it offers over other servers is that it give players the ability to create and share their own kits. Featuring duels, FFA and teamfights, Legacy is one of the most popular 1.19 PVP servers. It's biggest drawback however, is that it only has one proxy, that being in NA, so if you live in places like Europe or Asia, players need to find another server.
- Stray is another popular server and is exclusively an FFA server. Though it only offer 3 kits (being Sword, Netherite Pot and Diamond Pot), players here are better fighters, so if you'd want to main Sword, Stray is a good server to start on. Stray also has 3 proxies, being NA, EU and AS.
- mcpvp.club is another decently popular server mainly used in Crystal PVP, though it also features other kits. It has 2 proxies in NA (East and Central) and one proxy in EU.
- Fusion Network is an Asian PVP server using 1.9 combat. It has FFA, Duels and even a Lifesteal server. The server is good for players living in Asia. They support Cracked accounts.
- CatPVP has multiple proxies and feature both an FFA and Duels server. It has NA, EU, AS and even an African proxy, making it good for multiple nationalities. You can also form your custom kits or use preexisting ones.
- Oceania Prestige is arguably the most famous 1.9+ Australian PVP server, making it good for people living in Oceania to play on, as they're typically forgotten in the PVP community.
- StrikePVP is another tierlist-verified server, hosting AS, AU and EU proxies.
- LOKA is an exclusive Diamond Pot PVP server featuring a special 33% damage buff making fights quite dangerous and faster. Due to the damage buff, the skill ceiling in the server is significantly increased compared to others.
- MetalMC is a server hosted in the Middle East, making it good for players who live there.

## Melee Combat: How to Fight
The majority of PVP is melee based combat: using your axe, sword and shield to damage your opponent directly. Swords and Axes are the strongest, most damaging non-crystal PVP weapons in the game and have no real limitations beyond range. Always use a shield in your offhand due to how effective it is against melee weapons. This section is to teach you how to PVP, becoming more advanced and skilled as it goes on.
This section will detail the strategies of how melee works, beginning with the Foundations of melee PVP.

### Foundation:
You have three avenues and essential concepts to use while attacking the enemy, in order to deal more damage: Crits deal 50% more damage per attack. If you crit and they don't, you win by a landslide. KB hits make your opponent miss attacks or set them up for crits. Blocking hits with shield and then attacking yourself lets you attack without taking any damage. Combined, they make up basically all of pvp. Let's examine crits first. They sound pretty overpowered. Note that using Axes to deal more damage is usually not a viable method, as the slightly increased damage per hit is negligible once you factor in the very low attack speed.

- CRITICAL HITS: If you can manage to crit somebody all the time, you win. You do significantly more damage to them than they do to you; you just win. Since you can jump 1.6 times a second, and can attack 1.6 times a second, critting constantly sounds great! Critting deals little significant knockback and so in general you want to play very close to your opponent to crit (no good reason to play near the edge of their range). Remember that you cannot critically hit someone while sprinting, so it is necessary to release W or tap S before you hit them to cancel your sprint. The reason you don't crit every attack is twofold. First, you must attack while falling. This means that your opponent knows you will hit during that time, making your attacks easy to block with shield, or to dodge out of. Secondly, jumping hinders lateral movement and harms your range, making you easy to hit at the edge of range during your jump. If you crit all the time, you'll get hit away in the middle of your jump and lose.
- KNOCKBACK HITS: The goal of a knockback hit is to hit your opponent up and away from you, out of the 3 block range so they cannot hit you back. Note that hitting someone's shield does no knockback and so well timed shielding can destroy this strategy as well. To successfully do this, you want to position yourself as close to the 3 block hit range as you can so that when you hit your opponent they are hit out of the 3 block range ASAP. The core of this strategy is sprinting and staying low to the ground in order to have the best reach possible.
	- A possible counter: Jump Resetting their hits will do a lot of damage to their playstyle. If someone is jump resetting your hits constantly, you may be forced to use more crits against them, or use some of the tactics listed later in the guide.
	- Combo Hitting: A combo hit is hitting your opponent at a specific timing after they fall to prevent them from hitting you back. The goal is to hit your opponent just as they hit the ground, before they can reset their sprint to reduce their knockback or hit you. A combo is chaining together many combo hits in a row. This method is utterly deadly, requires skill, and can be countered with a timed shield block to block your KB hit. They can then reset their sprint and hit you back.

Spacing is the concept of staying just out of your opponents reach, close enough to dart in and KB hit them at the right time to continue your combo.

### Techniques:
There are many techniques and maneuvers you can use in PVP to give yourself a large advantage. This is the next step in complexity in PVP up from just critting and shielding.

- Crit Spacing: When you try to crit a more experienced player, you will find it is often hard. If you jump at them while too close to them, they sprint in and hit you early in your jump, easily deflecting you. If you jump too far away from them, they just back out. Using proper crit spacing, you can crit them so if they try to back away, you get a free hit, but if they hit you, you are at the end of your jump and you are hit into the ground, taking very little knockback and you are still able to crit them.

- Crit Deflections: Crit deflections are a viable counter to being crit. Don't hit your opponent immediately. While in the air, your opponent is holding down W and sprinting and will therefore take very little knockback, until they touch the ground (after they crit you). They will take large amounts of knockback because they had to cancel their sprint to crit you. Exactly when they touch the ground, KB hit them and then pull back a little bit to begin a combo.

- Punish Crit (P-crit): P-crits are basically using the hit of your opponent to make a crit, since you're attacked, knockback would be applied to you and you would rise to the air momentarily. By using this short timeframe, as you're falling down and hit somebody, you make a crit. P-crits are useful pretty much anytime that you are able to perform them, because they give you the 1.5x damage. Most notably they can be used after you get crit, since your opponent will be close to you and their crit deals very little knockback. To p-crit you want to be close to your opponent. If you p-crit them every time they crit you, you will go even and overall things won't turn out too bad. The biggest problem is that most players shield right after critting, so your hit will be blocked constantly if they have shield.

- No-KB crit: A No-KB Crit is immediately holding W into your opponent after critting them, even before you hit the ground. It lets you stay close to them because you take less knockback if you are sprinting or holding W. It's a good technique to use if you want to stay very close and crit them out, but is especially powerful against Crit Deflections. If the opponent tries to Crit Deflect a No-KB crit, they might not be able to hit you far away enough and you can Pcrit their hit, or KB hit them back if you prefer.

- Double-crits: Double critting is jumping to your opponent for a crit, then using a p-crit to do a second crit. It works very well against No-KB critting because they can't hit you away: they're too close to you. It does lots of damage very fast and turns a situation where you are being crit into a situation where you are even, critting each other out.

- S-Tapping: Quickly tapping S to back away right after KB hitting your opponent, increasing the chance that you back out of their hit and maintain good spacing for a combo. If you are too close to them, they will just hit you while in the air and break your combo.

- S-holding: A technique that can be used to get out of combos very very easily by... holding down the S key. You will take a huge amount of KB and definitely miss your next hit, but be hit far away from your opponent, letting you escape a combo. S holding makes it very easy for you to be crit, so be careful here.

- Circle Strafes: Circle Strafes is holding either A or D constantly, strafing a wide circle around your opponent while comboing them. It makes it harder for them to aim at you and allows you to maintain very good spacing, since you can turn a little to the left or right to move a little farther or closer to them.

- Uppercutting: Uppercutting is sprint jumping at your opponent and KB hitting them as you are still going up. It's an unusual technique, and can be used to catch your opponent off guard, since you burst forward with your jump faster than usual. Because of this you can also hold a combo with them if they try to back away and S hold. Additionally, if your opponent is using good Crit Spacing and you don't think you can reach them early enough in their jump to hit them away, uppercutting can be a good compromise to trade hits instead of getting crit. It's also a great counter to Jump Resetting, because your hit timing is irregular and hard to react to properly.

- Hitselecting: If you knockback hit someone while taking knockback yourself, the remainder of the knockback you have take is massively reduced. This is intentionally using the mechanic of hitselecting to take less knockback while trading sprinthits, giving you an opportunity to combo your opponent or set them up for a crit. In general, the less knockback you take, the better!

- Autohitting: Autohitting is done by spam clicking with your weapon while holding up shield. You won't attack with your weapon because you are holding shield, but if your shield ever drops (because it was disabled) you will instantly attack. If you do this, you just traded your shield for one hit, so you need to back up, possibly using items like cobwebs to slow them. This is especially good if you want to use a defensive play style.

- Shoving: This technique is extremely powerful, not particularly hard to employ, and gets harder to counter the better you get. Shoving is holding sprint into your opponent once you get close, holding shield and dropping it to KB hit them or sweep hit and continue to hold shield. The advantages are that you can keep your opponent off their feet and stay close to them, making counterplay very difficult. All pcrits or deflections will be blocked. If you are hit back, you can pcrit. If your shield gets disabled, you can crit deflect them away to avoid being punished. With total control over the spacing and movement of both players, Shoving is best used to feed into another technique. If used for too long your shield will be disabled and the Shove will end. You can transition into a Stun, Combo, No-KB Crit, Sidesweep, Backstab, and many other techniques easily by using a Shove as a setup.

- Walkthroughs: Walk or jump through your opponent, without turning around. Hit them while you are physically inside their hitbox. If your head is in the back half of their hitbox, you will hit them regardless of their shield. Extremely difficult to time, but can also get you free hits when both players are low. Like Backstabs, these work well while Shoving.

- S hold Crit: An S hold crit is a counter to Pcrits and Crit deflections. Hold S while in the air toward the end of your crit, allowing yourself to back out of their Pcrit or Crit deflection hit. When doing this, it's very easy for them to dodge your hit or hit you away in the air, so you have to predict that they will Pcrit or Crit deflect.

- Sidesweeps: After being crit, you can surprise your opponent by moving into them and strafing to their side, releasing W and sweep hitting them to deal very little knockback. You strafe so quickly around them that they are forced to miss their next hit, setting them up for an aggressive push. This works best against No-KB crits.

- Axe Bait: Hold up your shield at the start of an exchange. Drop it just as they run toward you; 8/10 times they try to disable your shield. While they're wasting their time spam clicking you with their axe, go kill them.

- Backstab: Get close to your opponent while they are shielding and sprint around them to their side and behind them, hitting them from behind and therefore ignoring their shield. It must be done faster than they can react and turn to face you. Works well against players that run when you disable their shield or crit deflect shield stuns, and can get you free hits.

- No-KB Disable: Perform a No-KB crit with your axe, with the intention to disable their shield (if they dont block, you get a free axe crit). When they hit you back, you will be knocked into the ground since you are still falling, keeping you very close to them, making it very easy to push them now that their shield is gone. This is one of the best counters to Autohitting in the game.

- Turn-Back Movement: This strategy is very underused and simple in theory. If your opponent has good spacing to crit you, but is more than 3 blocks away from you, you can turn away from them and sprint away, then turning back, usually to crit them. It fixes your disadvantageous situation and nobody can stop you, not even if they call you "cringe".
- Mirroring: When your opponent gapples in Nethpot, you do the same as well, this usually gives you +1 healing, allowing you to survive longer than your enemy.

### Advanced Techniques:
These are some more complicated and high level techniques. Many of them build off of other techniques and are more useful against better players, used to counter other more basic techniques.

- Falling Sprinthit: You can perform this easily by sprint jumping at your enemy and intentionally not letting go of sprint when you hit them, causing you to KB hit them while falling. If your opponent plans to Pcrit or even Crit Deflect you, they will be KB hit away to their surprise, giving you a free hit.

- Spam Clicking: Spam clicking at your enemy with a KB1 sword hits your enemy away, even by small amounts, without having to wait for your attack timer to come back. It can be used against combos to push your enemy back or against Pcrits, to push them barely out of your reach.

Spam clicking can also be used to break your opponent's sprint if you are running around each other and make your opponent easy to hit. S tapping away after doing this makes them easy to combo.

- S-Hold Pcrit Deflect: A possible counter to No-KB crits. Pcrit the first attack while backing out, and crit deflect their second hit. This is very similar to a Double Crit. You will most likely come out even and escape a bad situation.

- Swight Gambit: Breaking someone's shield while they are falling, intentionally letting yourself get crit by an autohit. This allows you to pcrit them and get off more crits from the shield disable.

- Pcrit deflections: If you are both Pcritting eachother, hold W into them until the moment before they Pcrit you, then hold S to take more knockback. Crit deflect that Pcrit and back away, sending them far enough away to stop them from hitting you back or letting you combo hit them. Therefore you come out a hit ahead.

- Offensive Double Crit: Critting your opponent and then backing up, pcritting or falling sprint hitting their next attack and instantly backing away out of their next hit. After the initial crit, hold S until you touch the ground so that their pcrit or hit will deal higher KB, letting you back away from them. After that, if they haven't hit, hold W so that they can't land a crit deflect. Go for a crit after the technique is successful, since it's likely they swung at you and wasted the attack and can't retaliate.

- Crit Deflect Bait: If your opponent likes to crit deflect your crits often, predict this and do a normal crit but hold S just before they hit you, taking too much knockback for them to reach you and combo you for your next hit. You crit them and they dont crit you, so you come out ahead.

- Early Critting: When you and your opponent both jump to crit eachother, hit them as early as you can (only once you start falling though. We still want to get a crit). KB hit them as soon as you can afterward; if you crit them first you will also get the KB hit in first and they won't be able to hit back.

- Trade Pcrit: By jump resetting AND hitselecting during a trade of sprinthits, you can get close enough to your opponent to Pcrit them. Catches pretty much anyone off guard, but requires you both to push in and sometimes a little ping.
- Switching to a no-KB sword: In SMP, you're automatically given 2 swords, one enchanted with knockback 1 and the other has no knockback. The problem with only using a KB 1 sword is you can't crit chain effectively as they're knocked farther away from your reach, while a no-KB sword wouldn't allow you to combo your opponent. In this tactic, you would use your KB 1 sword to apply pressure and after the enemy tries to retreat, you would crit chain them with your no-KB sword.

Defensive techniques:

- Deivi Popping: When your effects (Strength and Speed) are about to expire, swap your offhand gapples with a totem and prepare your hotbar around 3 healing potions, a strength pot and a swiftness pot, after which you do a suicidal move, then pop most your pots after your totem has popped. This usually catches the enemy offguard, though this strategy only works best when you and your opponent have around the same HP.

## Using Shield
Your shield is one of the strongest items in the game. It lets your opponent take 0 damage and 0 knockback, and you can do the same. It's completely necessary in winning any exchange to understand how to use it. 

### Disabling Shields
Disabling your opponent's shield is a huge part of SMP kit, giving you a 5 second window where they aren't able to protect themselves effectively. To disable a shield, hotkey to your axe and spam click 2-3 times, then immediately swap back to sword. Later in this section are some special ways to disable your opponent's shield to give you an advantage. Don't wait to charge the attacks: axes are inefficient at dealing damage. You can attempt to disable either when you see them put up shield, which requires fast reactions and good hotkeying, or by predicting when they will shield. While fighting, try to watch their shield patterns and learn them so you can predict them in advance. In addition, most players will shield with the following patterns:

- After eating a gapple
- After trying to disable your shield
- Right as their shield comes back from being disabled, especially if they are down HP
- If they blocked your last hit
- Right after the first hit of an engagement
- To block a Critical Hit or to block a Combo Hit

Be careful when your shield gets disabled. Did you shield in a predictable pattern? They might have learned that pattern. Be careful before repeating it.

#### Following Up:
Once you disable their shield, you have a 5 second window where they cannot block any hits. To take advantage of this, you can use 2 different follow ups.

- CRIT FOLLOW UP: Try to crit them out, blocking KB hits with your shield to get close and crit them. They won't be able to block a single crit, so you deal massive damage very quickly. Consider using an ender pearl to pearl close to them, or using a cobweb/placing water on them to trap them. If you want to use a crit follow up, its okay to only click their shield once when you disable it. That way you won't hit them away from you if you successfully break shield.
- COMBO FOLLOW UP: Combo your opponent. Because they can't block predictably timed Combo Hits with their shield, they are easy to combo while their shield is down.

#### 
When your own shield is disabled, you are very vulnerable to the crit or combo follow ups in #⚜foundation. By far one of the most effective ways to play while your shield is disabled is KB hit trading. Back away and try to bait your opponent. Trade KB hits with them, holding S after each hit to get too far away from your opponent to be comboed. This is a very slow playstyle and your shield will come back up soon. The reason it works so well is that if your opponent attempts to block your hit with their shield, you can easily either disable it or back away from their hit before they lower their shield, rendering their shield advantage useless.
Another trick you can use when your shield is disabled is literally to pearl out and heal. If you can safely get the pearl off, you might avoid a very costly encounter. It might seem sort of hacky or cringe, since you're just running away whenever you're at a disadvantage, but your opponent can't do anything besides cry about it. Don't do this if you are going to get crit out while the pearl is in the air.

### Shield Techniques
Here are some shield related techniques you can use. Some of these are very difficult to perform, and some of them delightfully simple, but they can give you a significant edge in getting more effectiveness out of your shield.

- Shield Delay Bait: You can abuse the roughly 1/2 second delay on raising your shield to trick your opponent into try to disable a shield that isn't really there. If you raise your shield quickly, for less time than the delay, your shield never becomes active but appears on screen, making your opponent think that they can disable it. If they fall for it they will be axe-spam-clicking your body and accomplishing nothing, making them easy to crit out.

- Hit Delaying: Hold up your shield and wait until your opponent hits you, then immediately hit them back. Due to shield delay they won't be able to get their shield up fast enough and you get a free hit on them. The only danger of this method is that if you hold it up for very long, most opponents will disable your shield. You will need to precit your opponents hit, which is easiest if they jump at you. Most times, since they jumped, they will be desperate to crit you and will hit into your shield while falling, hoping that you will drop it. Just wait for their crit to be blocked, and hit them immediately after. This method is especially powerful in UHC, where losing your shield isn't as easily punished. Its very easy and is best at countering over-aggressive players.

- Cooldown Trick: By swapping to your axe at the exact time you hit with a sword, you can perform a sort of bugged sword hit that deals full sword knockback and damage, but can disable shields. It has to be done extremely fast, but can be incredibly powerful when you don't want your hit blocked.

- Shield Sacrifice: This is essentially autohittting in SMP kit, where you plan to let your shield be disabled in exchange for a hit. The advantages are that you get a free hit and take no damage or KB from their hit, possibly saving you from a bad situation. However, having lost your shield for just one hit, you need a strong understanding and a plan for how you will play with your shield down. Shield Sacrificing is actually a very powerful and important technique. It can be frustrating to punish and confusing to play against, but to employ it, you MUST be using it in high-impact situations and avoiding any disable follow-ups.

- Pre-Firing: Lowering your shield has a delay similar to raising it, its just much faster (this can be tested in singleplayer). If you predict when your opponent is going to lower their shield and hit, but are afraid of your shield being disabled and don't want to use Hit Delaying, KB hit before them. Your hit will go through first if you lower your shield before them. You won't be able to block their hit, but by KB hitting and S tapping or strafing, you can dodge their hit. Congratulations on your free damage. Keep in mind that if you fail, hitting first will result in your opponent Hitselecting (explained in the Techniques section) your hit automatically. Either plan around that or make sure they aren't able to hit you.

### Shield Stuns
Shield stuns are highly important because they allow you to dodge the technique of Autohits. If you avoid the hit, you not only avoid the damage but the knockback that pushes you away and makes it much harder to follow up on your target after the shield break. There are many variations of the basic shield stun for different situations that can allow you to better avoid their hit or set you up for a follow up.

- Crouch Stun: One of the most well known stuns from the Axe gamemode, but still effective in SMP, Crouch Stuns are simply crouching just before you hit your opponent. Since your stun hits them up and you bob down, you make yourself further from them and hopefully dodge under their crosshair.

- Uppercut Stun: The Uppercut Stun is, obviously, stunning your opponent during an uppercut while rising up into the air. It's similar to a basic sprinting stun, but utilizes the element of surpise. By jerking forwards, you stun your opponent before they may be prepared to hit you back. Instantly hit out of your range, they will hopefully miss. Otherwise it isn't particularly effective.

- Sidestep Stun: Holding A or D during a shield stun lets you very finely enter and exit the very edge of your opponents range, and ideally be just barely too far away from them when their autohit happens. It can also make them miss, especially if done with Speed II.

- Close-Sidestep Stun: A close-sidestep stun is, again, holding A or D while stunning and is, again, far more effective with swiftness. The difference is that it is done as close as possible to the target. Instead of moving in and out of their range, you run out of their crosshair for the window that you are vulnerable. It's best used in low health, shield dancing scenarios and is particularly deadly because of how close to your opponent you are and how therefore easy it is to follow up.

- Combo Stun: Extremely effective kind of stun, especially in SMP combat. First you must KB hit your opponent. Typically they will hold shield to block a Combo Hit, and if they do, you strike. Because of the principles behind Combo Hits (Explained in the Foundation section) the stun will deal extra knockback and prevent them from hitting you. If you S-tap after the stun, it's easy to follow up with more Combo Hits. Because of this, a Combo Stun is devastating if you can predict your opponent's shield usage.



## Strategy
Longer term, overall strategy during fights to make the most out of your PVP skills. This section will detail how to heal yourself properly, win fights when outnumbered, heal your armor, and use your utility items properly.

### How to Heal
You can heal faster by having high saturation, or by consuming a healing item like a golden apple or a potion of Healing. Foods with high saturation such as golden carrots are preferred as more saturation translates to a longer period of faster healing. Since healing by eating normally takes some time and slows you down you want to do it while sprint jumping away if you can't ender pearl, preferrable after separating from your opponent as well as possible. KB hits, cobwebs, and blocks can all help you get away. If your opponent is healing, make the most of that time. Crit them out to drain them of resources if they are close. If they aren't close enough for you to reach this, do something else such as healing or refilling your hotbar. Just running at your opponent doesn't help you. Its also common for players to KB hit their opponent on the last hit while their opponent is healing. This sets their opponent up for a combo when they finish eating.

### Winning outnumbered fights
When you met with multiple people that has the intent on killing you, the best option is of course run or negotiate for peace. If that's not an option though, you'll need to figure something else out.

- Try to separate them before going in. Wait for one to run and heal, run away until one falls behind, or KB hit one into a ditch and then 1v1 the remaining one.
- The best way to winning outnumbered fights is by targeting them one at a time. Target the weakest one first, or the one thats least skilled. If you have no good options, target the player that's least consistent about healing. Your goal is to win by dropping them, since youll lose any drain fight.
- If you get a kill on one of them and they drop their stuff, grab anything like healing, XP bottles, or spare armor. Pick up anything useful from them, and if the other enemy is near, burn/hide their stuff so the other enemies cannot get it. This way, you'll be left with a gear advantage and will be able to last against the remaining enemies.
- If you and your enemies have the same gear, you can try to splash an invisibility potion on them in the heat of close combat to hide the nametags and confuse them so they don't know who's on whose team. It is highly unlikely that they will carry a bucket of milk specifically to counter invisibility. There are enemy teams that will carry a specific item to identify each other (such as colored wool) but having to switch to that takes time and gives you some breathing room to heal up or plan your next move. Also note that ever since 1.20, armor trims make this nearly impossible.
- During a frenzy, especially a 1v2, focus one target while strafing around them, keeping them inbetween you and the other opponent. This essentially uses them to shield you from their teammate, keeping the damage you take to a reasonable amount.

### Proper usage of utilities
Utilities are your backup weapons in a fight. The most effective way to use utilities is to have just a couple in your hotbar and become quick and experienced with using them so you can constantly bombard your opponent with effective secondary attacks.

- Proper usage of ender pearls is important. When escaping, you should throw your pearls not too close to the enemy, as they can easily chase you and kill, but not too far as pearl teleports aren't instant and they will have enough time to inflict massive damage or finish you off. An important game mechanic in Minecraft combat is known as the i-frame, or invincibility frame, wherein if a player took damage, they'll appear as red for 0.5 seconds. During this time, they cannot take knockback from anything other than explosions, so by using the damage done by an ender pearl teleport, you can get right into your opponent's face without taking knockback from their attacks. This is called pearl flashing and is best done when you need a tempo advantage over your enemy, which is why sometimes you see pro players use their ender pearls on their opponent for no apparent reason. Keep in mind thatanyform of damage will grant i-frames, which includes fall damage, poison, hazardous blocks like cactus, fire, and magma, and hostile mobs. If those things are around and you're in a position where taking knockback is much less preferred than taking some damage, it would be wise to run into those hazards on purpose to decrease your odds of being knocked around.

- Cobwebs are another great utility to use. Cobwebs can either be used defensively or offensively. In defensive play, they're used to slow down a chasing opponent, useful to heal momentarily or manage your inventory. In offensive play, place a cobweb on someone and repeatedly strafe and crit someone out, or if you have harming arrows, pepper it on them by using a bow or a crossbow enchanted with Quick Charge III. Be aware though that cobwebs are also easy to escape, either by using ender pearls or with a water bucket. There is also no way to renewably farm cobwebs so use them efficiently. One of the most effective ways to use cobwebs is to use themdynamically,by transitioning from defensive to offensive. Say your enemy is chasing you, and you trap them in a cobweb. You can follow up by webbing them more, blocking them in and lighting TNT around them, so your enemy has to deal with a potentially deadly threat while you can heal or prepare to catch them during their escape before they can react. Two other uses of cobweb are the Hit Web and Head Web.
	- A hit web is hitting your opponent (who will have to be close to you for this to work) and immediately placing a cobweb behind them, in the path of their KB. The advantage of this is that they are suspended in the air, making it harder for them to hit you back and giving you an easy setup, despite being mechanically somewhat difficult.
	- A head web is hitting your opponent against a wall and placing a cobweb in their head (third block up). If possible place blocks surrounding the web on all sides but the bottom. Hit their legs/feet. They won't be able to use water to escape, so used correctly this is a good way to quickdrop someone, or at least deal a huge amount of damage before they escape. An often overlooked aspect of the cobweb is their ability to prevent knockback, which can sometimes be a life saver if, say, you're about to get knocked off the map or if you know the enemy would put ender crystals in your face once they deal that knockback. Its even possible to simply place a cobweb under you while you're being comboed to end it then and there, although you'd best have a plan to get out before you are crit out.
	- Draining: Draining is spamming lava or an empty bucket on top of a cobweb that your opponent is in. If they use water to escape, the water will be destroyed and they will be trapped, not only keeping them in the web but stealing their escape method.

- Tipped arrows are one of the most powerful items in the game, and can give you a massive advantage if you bring them in the right situations. They're expensive and tedious to craft, but the payoff in bringing them is invaluable.  Some tipped arrows such as the arrow of regeneration are downright useless in PvP scenarios, though, and the only useful ones in PvP combat are Harming II, Weakness, Slowness, Poison and Slow Falling. Slowness or even Turtle Master is great if you are to give chase, since it makes you faster than your opponent and makes them easier to hit, weakness is great for extended trades as they will do less damage to you. Slow falling makes it very difficult and slow for your opponent to crit. They glide through the air after taking knockback, making them easy to combo or crit since they can't control themselves. Hit Webs (detailed  later) are far easier against them, as well.

- 
	- Be aware that tipped arrows aren't affected by Infinity and are consumed as if Infinity wasn't enchanted on the bow, so your only choice is to bring a ton of tipped arrows if you want to spam them constantly, and use a stack of regular arrows if you still want to make use of your infinity bow, as that way, you wouldn't run out of arrows to shoot even if you run out of the tipped ones. A high power enchant combined with full charge could also override the harming arrows' effect (instant damage II) with its higher physical damage, which actually causes you to deal less damage with full charge than low charge since the tipped arrow effect ignores armor but the physical damage doesn't. Therefore, it is more advisable to use a crossbow with tipped arrows, as the piercing enchant goes through enemy shields and will apply tipped arrow debuffs, and if your enemy doesn't use a shield, multishot makes you fire a 3 arrow volley which is a lot harder to dodge than a single shot, and harming arrows will work no matter what, since it doesn't do enough physical damage to override its effects.

- Splash potions of Poison can help you in PVP. Poison constantly damages your opponent through their armor and messes up their movement with damage ticks. It can be countered with honey bottles which are stackable to 16 and quick to drink. When you poison someone you want to crit them out and drop them as fast as possible. Knockback hits are less effective as the damage ticks mess up and cancel their knockback. Extended poison messes up their movement for far longer but has none of the deadliness of Poison 2.

- Lava can be used to set your opponent on fire. The best method is to double click with your lava under your opponent so that you pick it back up but still ignite them. The basic goal of using lava is usually to deal a bit of damage and force your opponent to look down and douse themselves, giving you a window to hit them. This is best used after breaking your opponent's shield or another situation where you want to follow up on your opponent.
	- Standoff Breaking: If your opponent is staring at you with their shield held up, you can strafe to the side and use your lava on them, dodging their hit. Since their shield didn't break they can't “autohit” you. They will be forced to drop their shield and douse themselves, giving you an opening and dealing some damage.
	- Fire Pit: Not picking up your lava to instead leave it on your opponent, dealing higher damage and immobilizing your opponent completely until they use water. You can do this to punish an opponent who likes to not water themselves immediately. This is best used if you have lots of lava to spare. It gives you a ton of critical extra time, confusing your opponent and doing a fair amount of damage.
	- Burning: If you are caught on fire, it's possible to not douse yourself and begin to crit your opponent out. They will have difficulty hitting you away because the fire damage will mess up the knockback you take. Even better, place lava on them as well so that you are both on fire. Stand next to them so that if they take time to douse themselves, they accidentally douse you too!
	- Counter Lava: Using lava on your opponent to force them to water themselves, giving you time to do something else in return. Whether you need to escape a cobweb, heal, or reposition, this gives you a short break from their attacks.

- Water has many uses in PVP. It can be used to douse yourself if you are on fire, or placed on top of a cobweb to destroy the cobweb. It can also be placed on your opponent to slow them massively as they wade through the pool it creates. Once they are stuck it's your choice if you want to safely heal or attack them while you have an advantage. If you attack them, use critical hits as they can't escape them but don't take knockback from Knockback hits.

- Sponges can be used to get rid of your opponent's water. An especially effective use of sponges is to place them down after using lava or cobwebs on your opponent to prevent them from using water at all. If your opponent fully runs out of water, try to cobweb them or lava them as they wont have any way to rectify the situation.

- One usage of blocks is to place blocks below you to run above enemies cobwebs or water. Alternatively, destroy their water source blocks to drain them of their waters. Another is to place blocks in your enemies way. Alternatively, place a block in front of your opponent at about 4 blocks away. They will run into it and then not be able to sprint anymore. Not having forward momentum, they lose momentum reach AND can't knockback hit you, giving you a free hit usually.

### 
In these 3 kits, players are given usually 2 stacks of XP bottles. Now beginners might just use down a whole stack of bottles to repair their gear but this is wrong. 

Before repairing, make sure to back off way before your armor breaks (preferably when your helmet/boots dips to below 70 durability). Use XP bottles to heal your armor if it gets low. If your shield has mending, all the XP will go to healing your shield, so take off your shield while doing this. (Shields don't take enough damage to fully break during a fight, normally.) XP bottles heal all your armor evenly, but your armor has different amounts of durability. Your helmet will break while your chestplate still has 1/3 durability. XP bottles only heal armor pieces that you are wearing, though. Take off everything but your helmet and heal it to 100% durability. Now put on your boots and heal them to 80%. Now take them off and heal your leggings to 75%, and then chestplate to 70% durability. Also, make sure you're not too close to your enemy while repairing, since they can get free hits on you, wasting your bottles.

## Playstyle
It's extremely important to know how to play and when. Knowing how to deal more damage than your opponent is necessary, but you have to be able to chain your manuevers and gameplay together to really press your advantages and turn a mess of hitting things into a cohesive playstyle. First we'll examine the two most basic playstyles, playing Defensively or Offensively, and how to counter those playstyles.

#### Defensive
The most common playstyle in SMPs, a defensive playstyle involves constantly keeping a little between your opponent and playing reactionarily. You will be playing slow and winning by Armor Drain, steadily but surely. This playstyle is very effective against players that seem to have good aim and fast mechanics, but have worse strategy and might be too eager to rush into things. This is how to pull it off using your kit.

- Open trades with KB hits (main the KB1 sword). Back away when they run or jump at you or use Crit Deflections, seeing if you can bait them into missing or getting into a bad position. This also can discourage them from rushing you too hard.
- The main purpose of your shield is to protect you from damage or save you from scary situations.
- Abuse Autohitting and Shield Sacrificing to get in a free KB hit. Back away and trade KB hits. Some players when they break your shield are desperate to follow up, so see if they expose themselves to a bait and punish them for it. Pearling away when your shield is disabled is also a good idea sometimes when playing defensively.
- Try to get the first hit in an exchange. Doing this will make it so you can back out of trades and escape while still up a hit.
- Make sure you heal your armor safely and correctly. This is always very much true, but if you throw your armor durability, this playstyle is useless.

#### Countering Defensive Players
Defensive players need two things: they need to be able to run away from you, and they need to safely survive to drain your resources.

- First, just play calm against them. Understand that they are going to be constantly trying to bait you, so don't make stupid aggressive moves if they could dodge out of it. Play very aggressively if you have an opportunity to punish them; once you get very close they might crumble.
- Play aggressive on a shield break. Be absolutely sure you use a technique from the Aggressive playstyle to stop them from running or hitting you away, to force them to fight you. Close to you with their shield down is the single worst situation for a defensive player to be in. Pearl after them when their shield breaks if you have to!
- Pearlchase your opponent if they are low. This gives you free hits when the heal and applies lots of pressure, and can give an opportunity to drop your opponent.
- Utilize every tactic you can to drop your opponent.

#### Aggressive
An aggressive playstyle is constantly pushing your opponent, never allowing more than a short break. It mostly relies on being able to play faster than your opponent, making them panic or forcing them into bad decisions. You are often able to drop your opponent when they can't escape your quick damage. It requires strong mechanical skill and versatility with melee mechanics.

- You rarely want to knock your opponent very far, or take KB much yourself. The No-KB sword will see a lot of use. Use No-KB crits, Pcrits, shielding, and jump resetting as much as possible so stay on them and allowing yourself to crit them constantly, dealing damage as fast as possible.
- Your shield is primarily for preventing knockback. If you are able to stay close to your opponent without being deflected or comboed, your crits will do all the rest. Blocking their much lower damage output isn't as important as continuing to crit them out.
- Make sure to follow up on shield breaks as much as possible with crit chains. Use No-KB stuns (a No-KB crit with an axe to disable their shield) and Single Click Disables (only click their shield once to not deal extra knockback) so that you are close to them once their shield is down.
- Keep a health advantage at all times so that you can afford to rush the other player at any moment and not worry about healing yourself. A lot of value will come by pushing your opponent when they need to heal; getting very close to them and spamming your shield so that they don't have an effective way to escape to heal.

#### Countering Aggressive
Aggressive players want to disable your shield and catch you in a bad situation to crit you out. You're gonna need to react to all they're doing and avoid getting dropped at all costs.

- Adopting a very defensive playstyle is the most simple counter. Just bait them and punish them for their most aggressive moves to take the edge off of it. However, use your shield sparingly and cautiously unless you have a plan for if it gets disabled.
- Disabling their shield is a very important part of countering this playstyle, as otherwise all your attempts to hit them away can be blocked. Without a shield they are easy to crit deflect and combo.
- Instead of pearling out when low, pearl out when you won't be punished for it. If you get some distance from them, that's a safe time to heal you should capitalize on.
- You can use backstabs or sidesweeps occasionally. This relies on the fact that they constantly push into you as hard as they can to stop you from running, so switching playstyles and running into them will surprise them and they won't be in a good situation to counter it.

#### General Playstyle Information
- Typically, the KB1 sword is simply a better option. Knockback is, generally speaking, just good for you. However, using a No-KB sword is still valid when you don't want to hit them away. Using W-release sweep hits or W-release crits with it deals almost no knockback. These situations mostly include when your opponent is very low and needs to run, when you want to play very close and critspam, backstab, or pcrit, or if you want to surprise your opponent by changing the spacing between you two.

- When playing against an extremely defensive player, its possible to run into them and let them hit you first, and then counter their attack depending on what it is. Preferrably you have an health advantage when doing this, but waiting for their hit will give you an opportunity to get a successful attack on them.

- When you and your opponent get very low, a good option is to offhand totem and rush your opponent in hopes of dropping them immediately. This strategy is slightly less effective in evaluation matches because you have only 1 totem, but in a real SMP, you can bring lots of them.

- Most skilled players have great reactions, but it takes more experience to change their playstyle on the go. If you begin playing very defensive, using crit deflections, combos, and backing out, they will most likely try to counter with something like a No-KB crit. This is easy to predict, and so you can counter by suddenly becoming very agressive, double-critting, backstabbing, and pushing hard into them. Changing your playstyle is a good idea if your opponent seems to be predicting and outplaying you in exchanges.

- It is possible to neglect fire resistance potions. One player, Marlowww, became the best player in the world until she retired by using this strategy, but almost no other high level players have been able to use this strategy since. The concept is that by constantly taking fire ticks of damage, your opponent won't be able to correctly knock you back. If you want to try this playstyle, notice that your combos will be very hard to break, and crit deflecting you won't work quite right. You need to play fast, close, and aggressive.

#### 
Minecraft ping is coded differently from other games. The two differences are that you can hit a player when you can hit them on your computer, even if your opponent and the server agree you can't yet, and your knockback is delayed by your ping. If you have 100 ping, you only start taking knockback after the 1/10 a second has passed for your computer to find out you got hit. 
Fighting Ping: Any opponent that has ping has slower reactions. Strategies like No-KB crits that require immediate counters work very well. Their shield disabling will also be very delayed: you can get away with much more aggressive shield usage. Don't try to combo against ping as much because their knockback is delayed, giving them a window to hit you. If you do, use Silly Circle Hitting or side strafes to make them miss, since laggy players often have more trouble hitting you. Low ping players should play more defensively since they can react very quickly.
Using Ping: You are far harder to combo on high ping, since your knockback is literally delayed, giving you an extra window to hit your opponents. Its better to be using an agressive playstyle. Use the Spacing Techniques detailed earlier in the guide to get in constant extra hits and pcrits before knockback takes place. It's also more difficult for you to be KB hit away, so a crit spammy playstyle is very effective (and annoying) here.

## PVP Mistakes
The world of PVP is vast as it takes place in a sandbox game, giving players many options, and not all of them are good, despite how tempting they may seem. A great way to learn your mistakes is to watch better players play and simply try to notice what's different. Why might they be playing that way or using that item?

### Gear Misconceptions
- Tridents

When the trident was released, players jumped to use the new PVP item, a versatile weapon for ranged and melee. However, sadly, when min-maxxing in PVP, the trident falls short of an axe in melee and can't rival the bows damage in range. Tridents should therefore not be used as a weapon unless no other ranged option exists.

- Healing Potions

Healing potions are sometimes considered popular, but this is largely due to faction servers such as Loka or older servers where better options were not available. Healing potions take up huge amounts of inventory and hotbar space and are outpaced by the stackable Golden Apple, which should be your go-to healing item.

- Harming Potions

Harming Potions are able to bypass armor but cannot bypass the Protection enchant. They do not drain your opponent's durability either, giving you meager returns for so many inventory slots filled.

- Firework Rockets

Firework Rockets are often said to do much more damage than they actually can in PVP. They can still be an effective way to drain your opponents armor durability and as a huge plus fill their screen with colors and effects. However, they are not the superweapon they can be made out to be.

- No Knockback Sword

Many players automatically bring just a singular non-knockback sword to fights. This is a huge mistake! Netherite armor makes Combo Hits completely ineffective in many scenarios, letting your opponent crit you out without good counter options. Knockback 1 levels the playing field again, making their knockback similar to as if they were only wearing Diamond armor, letting you use your full range of tactics on them.

### Strategy Misconceptions
- Overemphasis on Range

Despite the intuitiveness of ranged weapons, most ranged weapons deal lackluster damage against a geared opponent if compared to sword crits while shields offer a near impenetrable defense. Usage of ender pearls to rush archers is also a problem for bow-reliant players, where they can get many crits off while taking little damage in return for each engagement. Bows are a good tool for utility and chipping at your opponent, but not a primary weapon. 

- Offhanding Totem

The Totem of Undying is a popular offhand choice, but there is one simple problem: It does not do anything. It should be used when you are very low health to prevent death, but when you aren't at risk of dying, a shield or other utility item will help you far more than the golden statue.

- Reliance on Axe

A netherite axe with sharpness 5 and strength II will deal 19 damage, only 11% more damage than a sword would deal, despite the attack speed of under 2/3 the sword attack speed. Using the axe just for the extra damage is usually not a good tactic as you just don't get enough value from it. It's true value comes from its shield disabling ability. It should almost only be used either be used spam clicking to disable shields, or using a fully charged axe attack when you have the time to prevent your opponent from blocking it.

- Escaping Cobwebs

Many players use water to escape cobwebs, as this is the most intuitive way. Indeed this is a solid option, but if ender pearls are available, always use them. Ender pearls are instant and can get you out much more smoothly, leaving no reason to let yourself get hit as you wash away the cobweb.

- Using Milk

Milk is a common way to escape negative status effects. However, milk also removes your positive status effects! Strength, speed and fire resistance are all crucial. Honey is still viable to clear Poison as it does not clear your positive effects.

## General tips for each famous kit
### Sword
Basic tips: 

- Learn to sprint-reset and S tap effectively.
- A lower DPI and a lower sensitivity is important to keep your crosshair steady on your opponent.
- Diamond sword isn't simply about getting your enemies in combos. You need to learn how to crit and jump-reset.
- As mentioned before, jump-resetting is incredibly useful in negating knockback.
- Most importantly, spacing and timing is important. Aim and strafing is useless without the aforementioned two.

Advanced tips:

- Sometimes you would meet people who have higher ping than others, making it challenging to defeat them as combos won't work. Try critting them out instead as combos are almost useless against them.
- Switch playstyles depending on the situation. Although it's important to have a main style, having backup styles won't be as bad, and if your opponent can decode your style, you can have plan B to defeat him.
- If on a p-crit trade, you can be unpredictable by immediately W-tapping him, which can mess up his aim. You can also do this when your opponent is trying to crit you out and you critted him once. This latter tip is called "Sprint Hit Deflection".

### Netherite pot
Basic tips:

- Your main fighting style in this kit is p-critting with occasional knockback hits to keep some distance and get extra hits on your opponent.
- Golden apples should be on your offhand, don't put a totem unless you're going to do Deivi popping (explained later) since with a totem on your offhand, you'd have to hotkey to yourgapples, unlike when your gapples are on your offhand, you can just hold right click to eat. This makes it so you don't have to reset your attack timer after eating.
- You can combo opponents but don't make this your main style, as netherite armor has a passive knockback resistance that cancels out knockback, as well as jump resetting. Hit-selecting also doesn't work so don't mainly rely on your sword skills to win in nethpot fights, as critting and timing are much more important.
- Never use a scrollwheel, force yourself to use your keybinds to pot fast.
- Deception: Try to run away for a moment and at the least expected moment, W-tap them afront and combo them. You can also crit them out instead of W-tapping depending on your preference.

Advanced tips:

- Mirroring: When your opponent gaps, you gap right after them. This results in you having more healing than your opponent.
- Strafing: When in a p-crit trade, press S then W-tap to combo an opponent.
- Deivi Popping: A technique created by Deivi_17. When low on effects, offhand a totem, make sure you have at least 2 healing pots, a strength and a swiftness pot. Then do a suicidal move, after your totem pops, immediately splash all your pots to win in an engagement. Not recommended when your opponent has a way higher HP than you (like more than 6 hearts) and when they gap as well.

### Axe and shield
Axe is a very strategical mode. The axe is your main weapon, and players play very dirty. Autohitting and Backstabbing is of great importance. It's very common to let the opponent disable your shield, autohit them, shoot them with a crossbow to push them away, and run until their shield is back. You need a good understanding of what each player has available to them, and therefore what move they want to make. Baiting your opponent into jumping could get you a free crit, turning the tide of the round. Bowing them near the end of the round when they have no shield might finish them off. At any moment you might only have one opportunity or play to make, and your job is to find it and execute it properly.

### Diamond potion
Basic tips:

- Although the standard sword kit provides the foundation of how to fight, your aim would drastically be changed due to the Speed II effect present in the kit. Therefore it's advisable for players to play at Speed kit (sometimes labelled as ninja) to get the hang of the new speed effect.
- Healing and refill speed plays a big role, as well as hotkeying. Modify your keybinds to what suit you the best. Although scrollwheeling may be great for starters, it would be very annoying in the long run and a player who relies on hotkeys rather than the scrollwheel will most of the time heal faster than a scrollwheel player. For refills (putting pots in your hotbar), practice butterfly clicking, shift and accurately pinpointing the pots you want.
- Try to play close to your opponent with crits and jump resets if they are low, so that you can hit them and steal the potion effects when they turn to heal.

### UHC
UHC is unique for a reason, that is because of a game mechanic being absent, the ability to heal naturally. This meant that you can't heal on food alone, and you'd need the regen and absorption from golden apples to heal. Aside from that, UHC has a diverse inventory of melee, ranged weapons and utilities that players can use to their advantage.

Players must be fast at hotkeying, and scrollwheels won't simply cut it, since hotkeys are more accurate and faster. Second, players must know how to use each utility to their advantage, and must know when to fight defensively to drain or offensively to drop your opponent. Blocks for example, can be used not only to build/bridge up but also to put out a lava or a water source block when placed down. Its an interesting mix of the melee combat similar to SMP kit and intense mastery of usage of utility items.

### SMP
Now each SMP might have a set of standard rules when it comes to fighting, such as netherite or certain potions being illegal. Even though this is the case, the tips here can still be used on SMPs regardless of their rules. For this kit, we're going to assume that the kit contains fully enchanted netherite armor, 2 netherite swords (one is fully enchanted without Knockback I, while the other doesn't have Knockback), a fully enchanted netherite axe, 2 stacks of gapples, one totem, around 4 stacks of pearls, a fully enchanted shield, 2 stacks of XP bottles and finally copius amounts of Strength II, Speed II and some Fire Resistance (8 minutes) potions.

Basic tips:

- Master the shield techniques, as well as sword techniques. These will be your biggest tools.
- Shield would be one of your biggest roadblocks in SMP fighting. Try to learn when your opponent is going to shield and disable it with an axe, giving you a huge opening.
- Pearl away at around 4 hearts, also you shouldn't pearl too close for your enemy to chase you, but also not too far that it would take some time to actually teleport you to the pearl.
- Deception: You can try to fake that you're low, eat 1 or 2 gapples to fill your saturation and play aggressively. Your opponent may naturally forget to heal since they thought you're on low HP, pushing you and accidentally dropping.
- Drain: Take as little hits as possible. Always heal away from your opponent so that they don't hurt your armor durability while you are healing.
- Knockback I sword can be a gamechanger. You can use techniques such as crit deflects and combos that are usually ineffective against netherite armor.

### Crystal PVP
Crystal PVP is using End Crystals and Respawn Anchors to defeat your opponent. End Crystals and Respawn anchors are capable of one-shotting players in full Prot IV netherite armor, and so it is generally regarded as the most powerful form of PVP. Many survival servers ban or disable these items, and even on those that do, getting large quantities of crystals and anchors can be time consuming and expensive.

- 
	- Gearing Up
		- At least a stack of obsidian, end crystals, respawn anchors, and glowstone blocks as your main weapons.
		- Bring as many totems of undying as you can since they will be your main method of staying alive.
		- A piercing or multishot crossbow with arrows tipped with slow falling to make it harder for your opponent to seek the low ground.
		- 2+ stacks of Bottles o' Enchanting in order to heal your armor with the Mending enchantment.
		- Instead of Proection IV on your leggings, Blast Protection IV is preferred in Crystal PVP. You can always have a Protection IV leggings in your inventory or ender chest as a back-up in case you find yourself in a sword fight situation.
	- Items and Mechanics
		- End Crystal: End Crystals can be placed on top of obsidian or bedrock blocks by right clicking obsidian with the end crystal. Any damage will explode an end crystal, causing it to deal damage that can be blocked by a shield. End Crystal damage is vastly higher if your legs are on the same or higher Y level than the end crystal. It's also not possible to place an end crystal if its hitbox would conflict with another entity hitbox such as another player or dropped item.
		- Respawn Anchor: Respawn Anchors can be placed in the overworld or end and then charged with 1-4 glowstone blocks (charge has no impact on damage). Once charged they can be set off by right clicking them, dealing damage in the same fashion as an end crystal and creating a large, fiery crater.
	- Strategy:Crystal PVP is all about being lower than your opponent and setting off your explosives so that they damage them far more than they damage you.
		- Ledge Crystal: Running off of a ledge that you and your opponent were both on, putting down an obsidian and spamming crystals into the obsidian.
		- Hit Crystal: Hitting your opponent, then placing an obsidian and spamming crystals into the obsidian while they are in the air. It's best to use a sword enchanted with Knockback 1 to hit your opponent.
		- Safe Anchor: Placing a respawn anchor in front of you and any block in between you and the anchor. That will shield your legs from the damage of the explosion, but still harm your opponent.
		- Blocking Off: If there is a block of obsidian under or around you where you might get crystalled, it's a good idea to quickly cover it up with other blocks so that end crystals can't be placed on the obsidian.
		- Double Tap: Hit your opponent with a sword then immediately place an obsidian and blow up a crystal. Then, right when your opponent stops flashing red, blow up a second crystal to double-pop your opponent. This instantly kills any player holding only 1 totem. However, this requires strategic timing as the second crystal cannot be too late or too early.
		- Double Handing: Essentially, this means holding 2 totems to avoid dying to a double-pop. You can have a slot in your hotbar for a totem and bind a hotkey to that slot. Right when you feel like you are going to get popped, switch your main hand to that hotbar totem by pressing the hotkey.
		- Pearl Flash/Abuse: After you pearl, you will have a damage tick, during which your opponents cannot deal knockback to you. By exploiting this, you can avoid getting hit by your opponent. This can be used both as a defenive mechanism, or you can use it to instantly perform a hit crystal on your opponent. If your opponent face-places, remember to pearl directly at your feet to not get caught in the crystal.
		- Face Placing: Place an obsidian right in front of you and spam crystals. This is to counter pearl flashing as crystals can catch your opponent's incoming pearl, which usually throws them off (sometimes it can straight up pop them).
		- Retoteming and Inventory Management: When you get popped, you will need to restock the popped totem either in your hotbar or offhand. This requires you to go into your inventory and quickly hover your mouse over a totem, then immediately press the offhand key or hotbar totem key to put the totem in the corresponding slot. (For example, if your switch to offhand is binded to "F", hover over a totem and press F; if your hotbar slot for the hotbar totem is binded to "V", hover over a totem and press V). To make this process as fast and accurate as possible, you should put all your totems around the center of your inventory, which requires good inventory management. When you are having difficulty retoteming due to them being to far from the center, you can disengage from the fight temporarily to fix your inventory.
		- Hit Crystal (Advanced): As previously mentioned, you can combine pearl flashing and hit crystal to instantly perform an attack on your opponent. To achieve this, first step is to aim your pearl at your opponent's feet then throw it. Then, immediately start spam clicking while your crosshair is facing the general direction of your opponent. This allows you to instantly hit your opponent up in the air right when your pearl lands next to them and perform a hit crystal/double tap instantly.

## Organized PvP


### Structures
** Standard base **
A base made of cobblestone with several chests and beds for allies.

** Heavy base **
A base made of 3 layers of cobblestone and about 50 beds and over 100-150 chests. Recommended to have a tree farm.

** Hidden base **
Very small, but easily camouflageable. Do not make this base more than 15 blocks wide, or it will lose its ability to hide. Cave or jungle biomes are your best bet for making this base. To hide its identity more, add leaves and other natural resources around it. You could even add portal entrances to the base, so baddies cannot infiltrate inside the base from outside.

** Factory **
Not really a base, but produces resources and holds some player. Has about 50 beds and tons of chests. As the name suggests, this is where you get most supplies, but make sure your other bases have mini factories too. Have tree farms, ranches, mob grinders, experience farms, crops, cobblestone generators, and stockpiles. Have people who run it, and people who defend it. Make sure to add minecart rails and tunnels to transport supplies and people from the factory to the bases. A self destruct machine is helpful to avoid it falling into enemy hands. Make sure it has farms to produce food, potions/nether wart, iron and other minerals, and wood and stone!

** Destroyer **
A huge sky base with 200 beds, 200 chests and made of stone bricks with people monitoring the outside with dispenser turrets and other advanced weaponry. The only way for it to be destroyed fast would be lots of TNT. If you wish to mass-produce these, you really should build a cobblestone farm.

** Battlecruiser **
A medium-sized sky base with enough space for 100 troops and lots of storage and requires lots of cobblestone.

** Turret **
A redstone turret with a redstone clock and a rapid fire redstone gun that shoots about 3 arrows/second. Recommended for the guns to be high and blocked off.

** Cobble farm **
Recommended to mass-produce everything above. Creates cobblestone with lava and water.

** Local Brewery **
Made of about 3 layers of cobble, with creeper and witch farms (or just a lot of chests with these materials in them) and dispenser guns. Make sure to have about 10 brewing stands and people operating them, with about 20-30 beds and chests. Put splash potions of harming, poison, and weakness in the guns, hook up a redstone clock and watch the fireworks.

** Item stash **
An items stash is a small (no more than 4×4×2), completely camouflaged room with a few double chests loaded with equipment. Because they rely on not being detected, their locations should be only known to trusted members. The ideal location to build one is underground but in a location where no-body would dig. For example, near but not in a surface cave since the player trying to mine would just go down the cave. 

** Redstone house **
This house is the trap of them all! Make the house look inviting, iron blocks behind the glass, chests everywhere, and maybe a sign that was "supposed" to be to a friend for a secret entrance. They walk in the door, see the chests, and open them, only the chests are trapped chests! When they are activated, you can have them shoot arrows, lava, or even TNT! Make sure to add a piston that blocks the door when the chest is opened too!

### Troops
** Standard **
The stock iron. The most basic troop is equipped with full iron armor, an iron sword or axe, a shield, a bow and stack of arrows (or Infinity Bow and an Arrow) and a cheap source of healing such as steaks, oxeye daisy, or w. These are fairly cheap but are able to deal and withstand moderate amounts of damage.

** Officers and commanders **
Higher-ranked players or commanders or those of exceptional PvP skill are those who benefit most from superior equipment. They should be armed with enchanted iron or diamond armor, enchanted iron or diamond weapons, Unbreaking shield, enchanted bow possibly with tipped arrows as well as a few higher-quality sources of healing such as potions or golden apples as well as lesser sources of healing such as steaks. Given this level of equipment is usually given to more skilled players, they should be able to deal and survive significant amounts of damage.

** Gunners and other ranged specialists **
Owing to preferring ranged combat over melee combat, these units can afford to be less equipped defensively. Chain armor is acceptable, though shields should still be kept as they are nonetheless useful for protection from enemy ranged attacks. Beyond that, arm them with their preferred ranged weapon (bows, potions or redstone materials etc.) and place them away from melee combat. If armor is to be enchanted, consider Projectile Protection, as ranged units shouldn't ever be engaging enemies in melee range. Generally dishes out and survives high damage at range, unable to survive much damage at melee.

** Monitors and other defensive units **
The key difference between a Monitor and a Stock Iron is the former is defending a fortification with numerous advantages for the defender. Can be a Stock Iron put in charge of defense, can be someone better equipped. Regardless, they should be trained in operating any defensive redstone as well be capable of ranged attacks (and armed with extra ranged weapons if able) as to attack the enemy before they breach the defenses. Superior damage and survivability compared to enemy units due to advantageous terrain.

** Pilot **
For those experienced with using elytra (1.9 only). Equips full Projectile Protection iron armor (Minimum) with Feather Falling IV (minus chestplate), elytra, a Punch II bow/fireworks (1.11.1 or above only) for boosting oneself in midair, and a fully enchanted bow for dealing damage from above. Try equipping potions if aim is good. A Knockback II sword is also good if your enemy has the same ideas. Pack a lot of steak and arrows (or Infinity). Favor hit-and-run tactics, lack of a chestplate and use of Projectile Protection results in poor melee durability. 

** Juggernaut **
Frequently overlaps with Officers and Commanders, a Juggernaut is an experienced PvP’er of noteworthy skill equipped with enchanted diamond or netherite gear. Aside from higher grades of armor and weapons, they should also be equipped with ample healing including potions and golden apples to ensure they survive. These are the strongest units and the difference of power level can allow one of these to fight several Stock Irons at once and win.

## Faction wars
This can be done with a Factions plugin or through other means. 
This is when a group attempts to irreparably exterminate members on another group and later destroy or loot all property of the said group. 
These can range from a surprise attack to a formal challenge of two armies, and can have up to hundreds of warriors on either side (though this is extremely rare and may cause lag). 
In some servers, you may be asked to pick a team without knowing who is on it.

### Sabotage
If you can't hurt them from the outside, hurt them from the inside! 
If possible, join your enemy faction while you are still able to.
If you get into their base as a faction member, wait until the faction moderators are all offline. This is the best time to strike.
Take their best valuables, then break the furnaces, chests, and burn the items with a flint & steel. If they have a water mine, block the water. If they have a staircase mine, put a lava or two at the top. Go to the "/f home" and dig a hole. Put lava in it, from the ceiling and make a wall so as soon as they "/f home" they will constantly respawn in lava. If you have spare lava, fill the place with it! Make sure that there aren't any hidden chests, and destroy the farms if no one in the faction catches on. If possible, if they don't know you griefed/raided them, wait until they repair their bases with more food/loot and restart the process! Remember to give loot to your actual team after each raid.

### Infiltration
In most, if not all faction servers, there is a plugin that allows factions to claim chunks of land. If you are raiding a base, there is a 99% chance that they have claimed their base. So how do you get in? Here's how.

1. Scout out weaknesses: Occasionally, your enemy may have carelessly built part of their wall in unclaimed territory, allowing you to simply mine away the wall. They could have also left a hole or entrance connection their base to the outside, negating the need for you to make your own entrances. Finally, a wooden base is incredibly flammable and there is a flint and steel you can craft...

1. Use a TNT cannon: Any block except obsidian or bedrock will break down with a couple of well-aimed TNT blasts. Set up your cannon and fire away until the walls comes tumbling down.

Do note that certain servers have plugins that enable obsidian to be destroyed by a sufficient amount of TNT. If that's the case, then set up your TNT cannon and blow up a hole in it. There are bases that have obsidian covered in water, you CAN TNT-cannon in, but before that, either you have to turn that water to cobblestone or you have to fire sand in using the TNT cannon. Then after you've covered the water, fire your TNT in, now you have a hole to enter their base. If these servers do not have these modifications, on servers with the essentials plugin (Basically every factions server), if you sethome in a "dangerous" thing, such as lava and water, it will teleport you to the safest place. Abusing this glitch to get into bases where they have water underneath them or on top of them to prevent from being exploded, you can sethome at the side of the base in the water, walk away and use your command to go to that home, usually, you will be teleported inside of the base, but a way to counter this is to layer your base twice, what this means is you put a second layer around your base that can fit a player on all sides, then create a box inside of there, then even if someone glitches in, they are stuck in the outside layer and cannot get to your chests.

You can also build hidden cannons for a surprise raid. TNT cannons can combine with bombing flying machines and elytra pilots perfectly.

- Ender pearling:'If you throw an ender pearl up at a roof, your head will get stuck in it, and if you throw another ender pearl up while in that state, the ender pearl will go through the roof. A way to combat this is to make your ordinary floor, dig 1 block below each block of your floor, and fill it with lava.

Note: Some servers prevent you from ender pearling right next to a block.

### Raiding
If you intend to explore the full tactical armory of PvP, then a helpful one and likely the first is the raid.

Simply put, a raid is the theft of materials from the property of another player and killing enemy team members. Raids have a pro and a con.

- It drains the resources that can be used against you and increase your own resources.
- It increases your priority on their hit list.

There are three different types of faction raids:

1. TNT raid. Most of the time, nobody in a faction is online. In this case, simply bash the walls with TNT and then steal everything from the chests. This is difficult on underground and obsidian bases though, which is why usually you will do a…
2. Claim raid. This means that you will simply kill players in the opposing faction when they are online and claim their land. This is the only way to raid factions with huge obsidian walls.
3. Stealth raid. Though it is possible, but really hard, your faction can send a few of your faction members to attempt to raid the base without being seen. This is especially useful, if the enemy's base isn't tightly secured, but stealth is most likely playing Russian roulette.

Generally, raids are worth the risk. There are two objects that are absolutely necessary if you want the raid to be effective and efficient.

- Lots of food.
- An Efficiency IV diamond/netherite pickaxe. (You can combine two Efficiency IV enchanted books in an anvil or put one of the Efficiency IV enchanted books on the Efficiency IV pick to get an Efficiency V Pick)

The first is always needed since this may take some time. However, you may wonder why the list contains an enchanted diamond pick. It's because you can break almost anything fast. Without a powerful pick like this, the odds are that the owner will have mowed you down before you could even get inside their base! Therefore, you must be fast.

Choosing a base is easy, and really, an unmanned base is a dead base. When a minimal amount of people are manning the base, then you can strike. Steal all goods. Remember that your point is sabotage, and so you should dispose of all you didn't steal. If you really want to damage them, clog all entry points. Don't stay around too long, though. Take a minute longer and they might be online and hunting you down, in the end you're just wasting your time.

** Some tips **
1. If it's reinforced with obsidian,  it's likely they'd leave a door or something for ease of access. Enter there if necessary.
2. If you just want the enemy's equipment, then do it when nobody's around the base.
3. Creepers will be easier to control than TNT since you can lure them to the enemy's walls. Just be sure to wear some armor.
4. To find some bases, you can just randomly teleport to some people in the server, if there is a teleport trap where you cannot get out, usually you can sethome in that place as you are dying, come back with new gear and go try to kill them as they open it up to get the items, if it is a hole trap where they just hit you try to ender pearls out, people mostly idiotically make these smack dab in their base, so now you can get all of their items, setting home in a base is a effective way to raid, as you can raid while they are offline, if it is an enemy's territory, it is not known commonly that you can do /esethome and you can sethome in an enemy base.
5. If you know the base coordinates, go into the Nether. Walk/teleport to your enemy's coordinates divided by eight. Build a portal, and when you go back to the Overworld, you will be in the enemy's base.

### Tactical planning
Keep in mind that faction wars are not always about combat. It's about preparations and knowledge in order to turn the tide exponentially in your favor, such as how you can slay a player in diamond armor with only iron armor and win a battle before going out to war. You can't rush into an attack, you need to plan it. There's lots of ways to get a kill without having to fairly "fight" your opponent.

Now say a new enemy has come and they have Protection IV armor, with a Sharpness V sword, and an obsidian base. Attacking them would be suicidal in a fair fight (unless you have better equipment). First, send someone to scout their base while you prepare a full assault. TNT their base and ruin the defenses. This allows you to eliminate their source of power. Then, send someone to cause a diversion to distract them. They'll be chased all the way until they come back and finds the smoldering ruin that was their home. Lead them to a premade trap such as a TNT minecart bomb and detonate it as they chase you over it. No matter how geared they are, they will be killed and their base will be undefended.

Always make sure every fight is strongly in your favor. Go to reasonable lengths to ensure you can attack, but they cannot retaliate, or sacrifice to gain power, such as you losing 10 through snowballing them, but in the process breaking their diamond armor.

** Behind enemy lines **
As stated earlier, faction wars are not always about fighting. Although the point of a Faction War is to demolish, a clear assessment about the other side is helpful in doing so. Let's go into another scenario. Another faction is the strongest faction but is secretive, stealthy, mean, and rich. Your faction has never liked them, and in fact, hated them. But in terms of pure force, your faction is outclassed. They need you. Now, they equip you with invisibility potions, a diamond sword, a bucket of milk, a splash potion of poison and 3 of Harming, a bow with 128 arrows, and 32 pieces of pork. Throw in some Fireworks for distractions, and you're ready to go. The whole faction depends on you!

Now, as a spy, don't ever alert them to your position, because even if they don't know who you are, you are someone sneaking around their base, and they will pursue. To do that, you must follow some steps.

1. Leave an object to hold Shift to sneak and make it so that nobody sees your nametag. You don't have to sneak if you are invisible, but youwillleave particles if you run.Don't run ever.
2. Make no noise, under any circumstances. To recap:no noise ever!
3. If they catch you, they will certainly declare war. Kill yourself with permission from the faction leaders unless in hardcore to escape discovery if they are closing in. Be warned that you must use fire or risk your item drops being seen. Alternatively, if the server allows it, teleport out using /tp <player>. You may also use the command /respawn if you are in enemy territory.
4. Even if you know you aren't in reach of one, setting off a trap gives you away! Even if you are safe from it, setting it off may also alert whoever is in the control room. Take alternate routes. The only reason to try to defuse a trap is if there is no other way. Or if there is no other way because of people blocking you, you can set off the trap on purpose to direct attention to hide and kill anyone who comes to check the trap out.
5. Always have an escape route. (ex. Ender Pearls, /spawn or /tp, etc.…) If enemies have set their particles to "all" in the options, they CAN see potion particles emanating from your invisible character and you need a way to avoid being discovered.
6. Distraction can help (Fireworks, Snowballs, and Eggs) but this can backfire, as most of the time a base will go on high alert if guards keep finding baby chickens in the corridors.

Make note of everything. Don't write on a book and quill, write it on pen and paper to avoid being exposed, but write it on an in-game book later. This intelligence is most important, and can get you one step closer to victory. Do not forget that secrecy is required. Report back to your base once you think you have more than enough information on the enemy and that is when you can declare war. Another trick is to (if in a faction server) station your teammates nearby. (Say, a mountain bunker in the distance) That way, if you are caught and running for your life, you can send a distress signal or flares (The most obvious thing would be fireworks). 

One other trick is to pay attention to what you hear. Say you are in the base, and you hear someone munching on food. Avoid them as quickly as you can. If you hear a nether portal, then your team may be able to build a corresponding portal in the Nether and invade through the enemy's portal.

### Base building
Building a base to protect yourself from the diamond swords and the arrows? Good work! Here are some tips to help you make your base even more efficient: (Note that the marvelous Multiplayer PvP Bases guide is also useful.)

- Size: Bigger may not be better, as a visible structure gains visibility the larger it is, and leaves more space unguarded. On the flip side, big bases are good for large amounts of people that are working on something together, and can hold more munitions. A small base is also dangerous, because it will be easily demolished.
- Type: One effective type of base is a base that is deep underground. Here enemies will take days to hunt you down, while you survive on a farm and branch mine for diamonds.

Another base, meant for continuous habitation, is far above the world. Therefore enemies will be required to build up to it. Unless a prohibitively expensive defensive structure is used to get up, they can be easily pummeled with arrows, a single one of which could send them falling to their death or at least making them restart. For sky fortress builders, the most important rule is to not have any spots that are out of the fortresses' archers' line-of-sight. Try building the bottom floor in a "multiple ring" shape to do this.
Also, make a disabled nether portal that will upon activation become an escape (disable it to ensure that it cannot accidentally link up to another portal). Bases in mid-air are effective during a raid, when manned, as entry is all but impossible. Again, this base type is best for continuous habitation, but it is only slightly more protected than a house on the ground if nobody is manning it. Also make sure to put cobwebs all over the bottom to stop ender pearl glitching.
1. Defenses: Every good base needs traps and defenses! First of all, we have the wall. A good wall should contain at least one obsidian or water layer to shield explosive force, and require at least one minute to mine through with an unenchanted diamond pickaxe. To further prolong base penetration, chessboard wood and cobble to force players to slowly break wood or switch from axe to pick. Traps are great defenses to surprise enemies that make it through the wall, but are generally not infallible.

Note that self building walls can be useful during an attack to repair severe damage (aka theTNTequivalent of a bunker missile). However, remember that a trespasser will not simply pound at the wall forever (unless they are monotonously dedicated to it). Eventually, they will most likely climb it with blocks, or disable it by destroying the mechanism.
1. Allies: This is one of the great secrets to PvP mastery! Trustworthy allies can be useful in many tasks, from grunt work to being the safe keeper of your gold. Be careful whom you choose for an ally, as treachery or lack of skill can easily hamper or destroy your attempts to thrive in PvP. Haste in that aspect is generally a waste.

1. Tough base with a factions plugin: If the server you're playing on has the Factions plugin, you can create an impenetrable base with water and cheap walls. To do this, dig a hole along the border of claimed land (INSIDE your faction land, otherwise it can be blocked up or destroyed) all the way to bedrock. Next, cover your base with water, including the sides and roof, and let it flow down to bedrock. Make sure TNT cannot land anywhere in the base. There should be no blocks connecting your base to the wilderness. The water acts as a shield, making your base invulnerable to TNT, and impassable by enemies. The only way to counter this is make a sand/gravel cannon (a TNT cannon that shoots the falling gravel/sand instead). This can also be countered by a team of people using Wither. You can also bring elder guardians (if possible on the server) and bury them near the outside walls in obsidian, then build a wall of waterlogged stairs around the base. You can then cover that in another layer of water, forcing the enemy to use a Wither. You can use this to your advantage and get your whole team a smite V sword to shred the Wither(s) along with sharpness V to deal with the players after the Wither dies.

1. Skybase: Gather enough dirt to build to the build limit (about 3 stacks). Then pillar jump with all of it, or until you reach the build limit. Then dig 17 blocks down. Place 1 obsidian by pillar jumping with it, mark that corner, then build a 12×12 obsidian platform. (Set home to platform if /home is enabled!) Then find the corner you marked, dig down, (you should see dirt, and not fall), dig 2 more dirt down, replace the obsidian, and coat the bottom with lava. (Fire Resistance is highly recommended) Ender pearl down, dig the bottom block of dirt, and dig a 12×12×2 trench where the lava lands. Then teleport up, either with an ender pearl (may take multiple tries) or /home. You can now add the necessary items to your new base as needed. And finally, add redstone blocks around the edge, and build rings around the platform at a lower level for archers and potion lobbers to walk on.

** Security **
Building a base? Smart. However, check that your seemingly secure base is not vulnerable. Time to troubleshoot!

- Problem: Enemies can easily blow up walls and tunnel through them.

Solution: Reinforce the walls with rings of obsidian embedded in it to break TNT impact and deter speedy tunneling, and coat with water. To prevent glitching in, create two layers, the first layer is one that someone can teleport into with the teleport glitch (explained earlier) with a place on every side that a player can get into, then create a box in the middle, the second layer so that the person who glitched in cannot get to your chests, put two coats of obsidian on this layer so that the person cannot block glitch into your chests.
- Problem: An air based attack gets you quite often.

Solution: Build tall ladder shafts around the perimeter so that you can climb them and shoot off the enemy.
- Problem: Enemies eventually get through your walls.

Solution: Put lava falls to help deter them and have archers constantly patrolling the walls.
- Problem: Don't have any lava.

Solution: The Nether is there for open use.
- Problem: Enemies tunnel under your base.

Solution: Dig a long 1 block wide trench all around your base beyond the walls all the way to bedrock. Occasionally look down it, and if you spot any gaps in the "canyon" in the form of tunnels, ladder down and attack.
- Problem: You have bricked yourself in.

Solution: Find a way to put an inactive nether portal to another dimension in your base so you can portal away, or build your base around an end portal, or build tunnels.
** Self-destruct and escape! **
If the base is being raided, and your hand is forced, activate the self-destruct on your base. It is important to keep one on hand at all times and also have an escape. The self-destruct must be designed to overwhelmingly destroy all life and loot inside the base and the base itself but also be well-hidden. This is hard and so you should experiment. In times of need, start the lethal countdown and escape. Ender chests are good for these kinds of bases, as they don't drop their content and it can be accessed anywhere as long as you have another one.

Escape pods are essential for above-ground bases as they can drop you deep underground into a water spot, where you can dig (possibly minecart) yourself up to the ground and escape with your friends (if you have more than just one pod) to far away from the base. You can lock the escape pods with pistons to prevent enemies follow you when attempting to escape.

** Keep in touch **
Not all of your faction skirmishes in the PvP world will be set up beforehand. Organize raids with your faction. Find some server to host a voice chat box with your teammates. This will allow you to coordinate your attacks on hostile bases and their creations. The more connected you are with your fellow faction members, the more likely you are to emerge victorious. Keep in touch with them and increase your odds of success.

** Keep your own bases **
Let's say that you have just moved in with your awesome new faction. They have diamonds, dozens of anvils, and general awesomeness. Now, a faction war has started, and you have no base, no food, nothing except what the faction gave you. This is dangerous. In the event the faction fails, you are defenseless. Trust nobody and keep a secret base all to yourself. Put a home there and be safe from pursuers and spawn campers. Be ready! If you need to and fear that the faction is about to fall, steal some items and leave the faction when necessary.

** Don't be afraid to be a rōnin **
Rōnin were Japanese Samurai who went rogue after their master was killed. If your group's/faction's leader has been killed, or you just feel like it, don't be afraid to go rogue. In order to do so successfully, you need to follow certain rules. First, you need to either decide whether you want to be a wandering rogue, or a bandit-style rogue. Wandering rogue life is relatively simple. You wander around, and occasionally raid abandoned or unguarded bases, and avoiding other players at all costs. If you decide on this, you can refer to the nomadic experience tutorial to help you get started. If you want to be a bandit-style rogue, however, then you need a top secret base of operations, and lots of equipment. Only engage people if you are 100% sure you can win, and escape as quickly as possible. Trust no one, let no one see you. Although the life of a rogue may not be as action-packed as being in a faction, it is certainly profitable, and once you have enough stuff, you might be able to join a new faction, either to settle down or backstab them, get their stuff, and move on to the next gullible faction.

### Mass battle
PvP in large factions can include multiple scenarios, from individual murders or attempts to murder, to entire factions battling it out with lines of defense, barricades, and tunnels.

** Open-field battle **
To make it brief, an open field battle is the combat of multiple factions in an open area. This can cause chaos and may lead to a slaughter in the right conditions. Be sure to be well-stocked for this.

First of all, the open field battle playstyle is to have minimal life lost on your side no matter what, even above the victory itself. 

Think about it like this. With lots of people on one side, as well as regeneration from a full hunger bar slowly healing each player (and health potions), the whole army in general is almost continuously regaining health. (If your army's hunger bar isn't full, you shouldn't be in a battle!) Since all the opponent's damage is not placed in a concentrated area, every person alive is in a sense helping heal others. When someone dies, their regeneration and health is lost. So is their ability to fight, and the formation they were in is weakened, so momentum in terms of a steady advance is lost. Therefore, minimal life loss is the goal throughout the battle.

There are three major melee builds, which will be discussed more in depth later. They are:

- The juggernaut. These are heavily enchanted soldiers. Highly costly to make!
- The infantry. These are normally armored soldiers without enchantments. They are cheap on everything but Iron.
- The exotic. These are users of exotic weapons (such as many potions or TNT, also including professional archers) with varying armor levels. They are not difficult but suicidal hard in certain cases. Not costly, but it takes time to make. Their purpose is to deploy an unusual weapon such as debuffs or explosions on their opponents.

It is tempting in an organized battle to do one of two things:

1. Charge the enemy.
2. Run from the main areas of combat to camp the areas nobody goes to.

Charging the enemy is a waste of time and durability due to damage distribution. It is also near-suicidal due to the large number of weapons present. Running wastes time as well and is both cowardly and counterproductive, as then damage distribution will be far less useful.

Instead, have all your soldiers in a group and have a continuously switching front line.

The first situation is if the enemy has large numbers of archers. Send a wave of soldiers charging in, with moderate armor, and some skill, as well as some Special units to cause some starting chaos in their lines. Even better, get some enderpearls and rush in to engage the archers, who will often be weaker in melee combat.

If they don't have archers, they will run or charge. If they run, have archers retreat to the back lines and then have the whole army sprint, bunching Juggernauts close to the front line while staying together, for maximum impact.

If they charge, stop their forward momentum with arrows, shooting when they are 10–15 meters away. Then the infantry should then fight for a bit, while juggernauts and potion lobbers move in at sprinting speed to surge into enemy lines and later replace the infantry and slaughter anyone that was engaging the infantry. Make sure that the juggernauts and potion lobbers do this carefully, as the enemy infantry may have lethal potions.

However, in general, the enemy can do little versus Juggernauts and potion lobbers coming in from a flank as well as a defensive row of Exotics to stop enemy Juggernauts from advancing effectively.

However, if you are on the attack, there are some threats to your advance you must take into account.

- A massed force of archers or snipers (These can really break a big section of the front line off. Terminate them as soon as possible.)
- A hardened, continually blocking front line (These are really hard to fight by, but you can bait them just by having a player sprint near them and run away.)

Then charge with infantry, followed immediately by exotics. The juggernauts among you should flank around and smash the enemy infantry after a few seconds of fighting. The Exotics should only engage juggernauts in combat, and only with superior numbers. In this situation, have archers aim for infantry advancing toward the fight, NOT the enemy front line, where you could shoot one of your own men. One can make some professional charging units with horses.

Never have everyone charge at once. They will lose momentum and a solid position, while also becoming less cohesive which causes less damage distribution. Retreat, while also dangerous, is far safer.

** PvP better **
Many people think Minecraft PvP is "just clicking with a sword", yet it is so much more than that. Learning how to PvP may seem simple, but takes days, weeks, even months to completely master PvP.

Getting killed? With this guide and some practice, you will be killing diamond people with iron! First off. Swords are everything. Kill your enemy, and they won't hurt you anymore. Unless you are a tank and have some kind of lucky-level-30-enchanted sword, always remember that swords will save your life any day.

- Leather armorThe weakest armor, full leather armor will shield you for up to 28% of damage taken. If anyone has full leather armor, the thing that they will likely be able to get(and because risk of death is high), is an iron sword because leather is just about as easy to farm as iron is to find. If you ambush them with an iron/stone sword, you should be able to get about 2 or 3 critical hits in most cases. Each critical hit should be able to do 7.

Please note that they will likely start running. The best thing to do is to cut corners, meaning if they're waiting to see a wall to turn, turn right when they turn, that way you will get to them because you're both at the same place and they have traveled the most. Jump while sprinting to get to your enemy if you have the hunger to spare.
- Gold armorMany people don't use this armor, and it shields for 44% of damage, if fully worn. A diamond sword critical hit will do 6hearts on it.
- Chain armorThis is the least used armor because it is so hard to get. Protecting for 48% of all damage, it is about as effective as gold armor.
- Iron armorThe third best armor and one of the most effective sets of armor (due to iron being easy to find) iron armor seems fairly weak to be the third-best armor. It protects for 60% of damage taken.

A stone sword will do 1 full heart of damage against it with no buffs. A critical hit with a diamond sword will do 8 of damage, and if that is Sharpness I then it will do 5 of damage.

- Diamond armorThe second strongest armor. It withstands a lot of punishment. Even a Sharpness V (5) sword will only do 3hearts of damage. It protects against 80% of damage taken. If fully enchanted with Protection IV (4) then a Sharpness V sword will only do 2hearts of damage.
- Netherite armorthis armor is crafted from a netherite ingot made from netherite scraps from ancient debris and gold. it has about 2600 durability, has 1 knockback resistance, 80% damage reduction and 3 armor toughness, it could take a real beating!

** How to snipe **
Sniping and using a bow can be difficult for some but for others it's their natural talent. Some people have many styles of shooting such as jumping and shooting, aiming upward and strafing to the right/left or by simply hammering people with spam shots.

This tactic by itself is very ineffective if not combined with melee combat, as shields and healing easily defeat the lower damage of bows. However, as a method to drain your opponent of resources, sniping them can whittle them down over time and make a difference.

** Some basics **
In order to do this, you need:

- as many arrows as you think you need unless you have Infinity on your bow
- armor, unless suicide mission or if using invisibility
- food (doesn't have to have high saturation foods since you should be far away from getting hit)

Also, it is recommended that you strafe from left to right when shooting and you should also know when the right time it is to shoot another person. A good scenario is that your in battle with another person, and they're a good few blocks away cocking their bow up and you just started charging your own, what do you do? Well, first of all, you release it halfway there then strafe so that when they shoot, you have the advantage of shooting back at them dealing more damage to the enemy. To hit moving enemies, lead the arrow ahead of them some blocks depending on their distance.

** Sniping **
Sniping is attempting to hit targets at long range with a bow. Done well, sniping can deplete an enemy's health or knock them off a cliff before they even notice you, or at least before they're upon you.

When using a bow at short range, there is no need to aim significantly up.

At 1 degree upward, a bow will hit anyone within 25 meters with over a 90% probability of hit.

At further ranges, the level of precision needed to have a good hit rate increases. It is still possible to achieve hit rates close to 90% out to 60 meters, with a pitch of around 10 degrees. However, it is necessary to accurately estimate the range of the target. For example, an 8-degree pitch shot will hit a target between about 47 and 52 meters out with 90% accuracy, or about 46 to 54 with 50% accuracy. This means that judging distance accurately should be a reflexive habit for anyone who wants to learn sniping archery. Being able to, in a split second, figure out the range of a target, the height, and the approximate angle needed to hit (hint: F3 menu helps) will allow you to make shots at truly vast distances, with a 37-degree angle putting shots to around 120 meters.

If you want a mathematical formula as a guideline that will work fairly well under 80 meters.

Aim 1 degree up for every 4 blocks away your target is over 18 on level ground, compensating for movement appropriately. So for example, to hit a target 50 meters away, aim up by 8 degrees. 62 meters away, aim up by 11 degrees. 74 meters away, 14 degrees.

So Pitch = (distance - 18)/4.

Another good thing to do is keep in mind the target's horizontal angle. This allows you to make shots confident that the target is horizontally at the right position. Further, learning to judge distance is valuable. As a rule of thumb, a block at 60 meters away is 1 degree tall. A player at 60 meters away is about 1.8 degrees tall.

So for ex, let's say you see a player you want dead and they're at your altitude: the procedure a good sniper will go through is as follows.

1. Check the distance to the player by measuring their height in degrees. 1.4 degrees tall means 77 meters away.
2. If they're stationary, check the horizontal heading and note it.
3. Pull up by the appropriate amount. So in our example, it's 59/4=14.75 degrees. 14.7 for simplicity.
4. Make final lead adjustments based on player movement.
5. Fire. Don't just fire once unless you know you'll hit AND kill. Best to fire off shot after shot unless absolute stealth is a priority. This serves two purposes. For one thing, a bow can't hit with 100% reliability at 77 meters (My tests vs. armor stands indicate 60% accuracy, vs. 80% at 60 meters), no matter how good your aim, and unless you have a powerful bow vs. an injured or lightly armored foe or one above a hazard like a cliff or lava, it is likely your first hit will not be instantly lethal. If the enemy is walking toward or away from you, compensate by 1 degree per second. If the enemy is sprinting, up it to 1.3 degrees per second. If they are sprint-jumping, by 1.6 degrees per second, and also an additional amount due to them being higher up on average.

If a player is higher than you, a simple way of compensating is to look them in the face and set that as your zero. This works for relatively flat shots that aren't at an enormous range. For example, let's say we look at a player 9 degrees above us who's 1.8 degrees tall? They appear to be 60 meters away based on their height. 60-18=42. 42/4=10.5. 19.5 degrees pitch is a good approximation of where to aim. I wouldn't try this method for targets more than about 30 degrees off of level, and not for long range shots, but for under 70 meters and 30 degrees, it works quite reasonably.

Obviously, you don't need to do a bunch of math every time you fire a bow, but these rules of thumb can help you aim at a long range.

** Shooting styles **
Many people who shoot have developed their own style of shooting such as:

** Strafing **
People who strafe just simply move in one direction while shooting the target and occasionally take cover when getting pinned down. So when shooting you have to aim slightly above your target's head before shooting for a larger hit rate. In extended combat, opponents may be able to read your strafing patterns if you move predictably, so be sure to vary your strafing.

** Classic sniping **
While most of your allies are fighting the enemy melee (better if there aren't many troops on each side), the classic styled sniper (which have powerful bows) can fire a precise shot which will do good damage while the enemy cannot retaliate much due to your allies attacking them with a sword. Be sure not to hit the ally though. One may drink invisibility potions so even if the enemy noticed the shot and want to hit the sniper first, they cannot shoot the sniper.


Note that arrows can also activate wooden buttons or pressure plates, thus making good archers able to operate redstone contraptions from afar.

### Server war
This is a rather rare type of PvP. It is not friendly at all. It is just like a real war. Two parties fight for power or resources on a server.

Server Wars happen when one party, typically griefers, organize into an army and invade or attack a certain area or group of people on a server.

This attacking party is typically organized and well armed. They launch an attack big enough to cause a disturbance on the server. Another party, typically admins, retaliates against this attack. If the retaliating party is composed of admins, it will typically resort to Intel and the power to ban players. However, admins will counterattack with weapons in the process of banning the attacking players. Unless they allow griefing of course.

In an all out server war, you have two choices: you can either fight for one of the two parties, or you can flee to safety and let the admins sort it out.

Most players decide to fight for their server, however, players who have a lot of resources like diamond might feel the need to protect their precious resources and flee to safety. If you decide to join the party that is defending the server, you don't really need to worry about firepower since you will probably be armed by fellow soldiers.

If you join the attacking party, you should equip enchanted weapons with high damage. It is also good to equip weapons of mass destruction such as TNT, end crystals, lava buckets, etc. You should do everything in your power to keep your nametag hidden if you don't want to be banned. Being banned means you are out of the server, and out of the war. You can no longer fight alongside your comrades. 

When you are fighting with the attacking party, you typically want to destroy as much as possible and invade as much of the server as you can. A good tip? Drink an invisibility potion, arm yourself with end crystals and blast protection armor, and let the terrorist bombings commence on anyone you see, especially the ones that are insecure.

Remember, the retaliating party doesn't always win even though they seem like the "underdogs". Server wars are won with great soldiers, and most importantly, great leaders. You don't have to be a "grizzled" war veteran to be a great general, a great general is someone who is smart and fights alongside their soldiers. Remember, great generals take point, they don't watch from a safe distance and bark orders while watching their fellow players get slaughtered.

Also, if the server has mods equipped, especially mods like "flans mod", "flintlock weapons mod", or "Mo' explosives mod", use that to your advantage!

Because of the nature and the danger of these wars, the mechanics of these "groups" of people that are attempting to overthrow the server will be explained. 

Generally, the group may know each-other personally. If three friends chose to do this, and each friend tells two of their friends, then we already have nine people ready to attack. Doing this makes it easier to create order and hierarchy. This is also done to deter any traitors or turncoats in the group. Some of these groups go into faction servers, claim land, and make a legitimate faction. They will probably use the faction as a temporary "bank" for what they steal and make. They will build a secondary base, and will use this when they attack. They are highly armed, and are equipped with heavy enchants, potions, lava buckets, redstone, TNT, and whatever the Modifications on the server make available. They disband the faction, and move to the other base and create a new faction, (if they make one at all) and begin their attack, or they may each stay factionless (to avoid detection) and cause great destruction to large bases using the exploits above, communicating attacks via a third-party social platform.

There is a hierarchy involving the status and rank of the players usually, there are generals of the troops that go to battle. They are on the battlefield. And they command the players to attack. But these generals get their orders from one player. This player is the equivalent to the "god father". They are never seen, although sometimes in the game anonymously.

Several of these groups have primarily PvP champs, but most of them have hackers, x-rayers, cheat mods, and whatever they chose. Most times the hacker is the godfather or at least close to the top. They also have spies and intel groups. This is not the most usual case, but there are exceptions. 

Some of them have strategies that they commonly use. Some are griefing, personal raids, and singling out a player. For example, if they know that a player has valuables (diamonds, enchanted books, etc.) and they don't know where it is hidden, they may grief and threaten the player.

## PvP behind the scenes
Player-against-player combat is far more advanced than it may look. With it said, it's best to know what people can encounter in a so-called "behind the scenes" stage.

### Politics
** Be popular and revered **
If you want griefers or spawn killers on your side, be really nice to them. Most of them are notoriously good at PvP from practice, and giving them a reason to be on your side through making sure they never have to worry about starving or being hunted by others is a good way to avoid alienating them. Ironically, this may be the most effective way to make allies with random people, giving them full access to all of your resources and your considerable efforts to be hospitable will generally remove any want to take your items. (As always, this may backfire).

** Know the surroundings **
If a server has an online dynamic map or if the Rei's Minimap mod is allowed (most likely), USE THEM. Rei's Minimap helps you understand what structures are ahead of you, and Online maps show everything and also show locations of players. Forgo any advantage you can get your hands on.

** Participate in server events **
Whether it'd be a Drop Party or an organized PvP match, participate in server events and you'll be known by most members in the server. This means people will have second thoughts of attempting to kill you.

** Be nice to your troops **
This one is obvious. Make sure to be friendly and caring with your members. Give items randomly to the squadron. Make an Army, Navy, and Air Force if you must, but let them mingle. Give crate keys to your teammates if the server has a crate system. And make sure to not act stuck up. Listen to their opinions. If you want a Mega-Uber Skull Laser Chainsaw Castle of Death™, and your friend wants a smaller base, compromise.

** Defending your base **
Let's say you're on a faction server and you have many enemies. Your base has not been found until now. Two players each holding a Sharpness V, Fire Aspect II, Knockback II sword and wearing Protection IV armor are directly outside your base setting up a TNT cannon.

You should always have defenses that are innately active, such as obsidian and water to negate explosions and if available, a spawner that can funnel out mobs on command (go exploring for spawners) to distract and dangerously deter, or snow golems to break armor.

If you have these, don't jump down and PvP. Wait for the spawning mobs to break their armor, or call for your faction members and allies to assist in defeating the enemy.

In these cases, booby traps are good, so set up booby traps everywhere where the enemy can't find them. In fact, make some that are meant to make the enemy know about the traps but it itself is a trap. These work as warnings and signals. Use tripwires and wool under them to use as signals for example.

** Hate the spawn **
If you're building a massive fortress near the spawn, a griefer or simply a plain idiot might run behind you and kill you, disassemble your fortress and run off with your materials. Well, the easiest method to prevent this is to build your house away from spawn and try to survive a good distance away from spawn. It is usually a good idea to use the /sethome command around this area where you wish to live, as if it is a long way away from spawn and you die, it's a long walk, or mad chase if there are spawnkillers with diamond armor and enchanted diamond swords. Using the /home command if you used /sethome cuts the time getting to your safe zone drastically, usually having the spawnkillers and griefers be dazzled in confusion.

** What about my valuables? **
The best way to keep your most precious valuables is to put them in an ender chest. Then put a chest in your house with basic invaluable items in it (with a few valuables mixed in to help fool them), and bury a chest with 8 obsidian, an eye of ender, a crafting table, and other less semi-valued objects in it a short way away from your house.

Even if your entire house is a crater and the ender chest you placed is destroyed, the chest you buried will still be safe, and you can craft an Ender chest with what is in it to access all your valuable items and loot in there, as well as the loot in your actual chest.

### Basic PvP supply setup
The following is a step-by-step tutorial on how to survive while being new to a PvP server. Follow in this order:

- Go solo for now. If the server you play on has Factions, make one to protect your stuff. Be sure to walk at least 5500 blocks. Using a boat is a good idea as you do not need food and can travel at night.
- Go in the opposite direction people are moving toward. This prevents you from being noticed.
- Make sure it is far away from anything. There's nothing more horrifying than your mortal enemies being your next-door neighbors.
- Make a small, undetectable base. Underground is the least noticeable around layer 10 is ideal, putting you near good materials and hiding your nameplate on the surface.
- Cheating is something that undermines every setup. Step carefully!

- Start gathering immediately. Do them in this order;
- Find a village to set up your base. Move all the villagers deep underground so that other players cannot find your base.
- Make a farmer villager to sell bread and buy pumpkins.
- Set up a pumpkin farm or a melon farm. This will supply you with emeralds to buy items from the villagers.
- Make an Armorsmith, Weaponsmith, and Cleric to buy armor, weapons, ender pearls, and XP bottles.
- Make Librarians to sell you Protection, Mending, Unbreaking, and Sharpness books. These are the minimum enchantments youll need.
- -Make a portal tothe Netherin order to findblazesandnether wart.
- -Once you have a blaze rod or two, start hunting forEndermen.
- -Make anender chest.
- -Start brewing potions.

Tip: You must have a fallback in your base in the case of hard times. This means:

- A renewable source of food,
- A renewable source of wood, and
- A set of stone tools to restart the gathering of supplies.
- Hopefully a good pickaxe to mine resources.
- Backup emeralds to buy new gear.

- To make raids against you rare, it is recommended to live in the Nether (but not the End since it's highly coveted) where people normally don't go. It's dangerous, but not as dangerous as living in the overworld. Keep in mind, if you have a mining base, that too must be defended since raiders can get there via the portal.

- Make a faction and start recruiting.

-Note to do this when only a few people are online to make sure that nobody else is there to make you enemy (if you're lucky).
(Factions is a Bukkit plugin and is not part of a vanilla server.)

That's it! Not too long ahead, you should become good enough to last through most attacks... eventually.

## Getting loot quickly
A lot of times in single player survival Minecraft, you are going to need something. In factions, you are going to need it a lot more because you are competing with other people for it. Some ways to get it faster:

- selling- in many faction servers you can sell, auction, and buy stuff. Check and see what you can sell. Most Faction servers allow you to sell cobblestone and dirt, quick ways of getting money.

- Teleport killing- In the chat bar you see a new player and you want to take their stuff. They don't have any faction, so you tell them "Teleport to me and you can join my faction" as soon as they arrive mercilessly slaughter them. (Note that this can create a bad image for you on the server and could potentially get you banned, so only do this on servers that this is allowed or you don't value).

- glitching- use certain glitches to your advantage such as item duplication, again avoid the possible banning

## PvP itself-the foreground
### Lag creates opportunities
Despite lag making people randomly visually act, cause injury because of damage just showing up, and crash the server, it may still be useful instead of a nuisance if you know how to control it to your advantage. Whenever you hit someone under the effects of a lag spike, there is a chance that they won't be hurt and can escape. You can use this time to run when a lag spike comes, therefore you may escape if necessary. Keep in mind, lag also delays redstone machinery, meaning if there's a staircase that only activates when you're on a pressure plate, you can get up easier.

### Good philosophy for fights
** "Only the dead have seen the end of war." **
There is that one case of being Left for Green. This means that your squad disbanded, you are out, all alone with maybe a few enemies a kilometer or two behind you looking for you, and you're starving. Be independent. What if nobody is there stupid to help you? What if your leader takes all the valuables and leaves their troops out to die? You must gather resources, get help of any kind, whether it be a lone man just with a stone toolkit or a juggernaut in Protection IV armor, and you must be careful and start your own faction. Tip: Since anyone can be bought…eventually, keep your own secret, hidden, well guarded bases. Never tell anyone about it. It is for you and only you.

** Watch videos and tutorials on how to build traps (or other PVP tactics), and be smart with what you learned. Many people know how to make traps. That is good on one hand, but on another, they might not know how to use their knowledge to their advantage. Combine traps and improvise offline. **
** Don't overkill yourself. Think first before charging ahead to do something. Think first of the necessities, which are supplies, and deal with the secondary needs after. **
** Don't be scared to act like a coward. If you stand no chance, save what you can save and run! If you're nearly killed, and have no hope of victory? Run! And don't let yourself be lured into 1-on-1 PvP unless you can win! **
Use your mind over your in-game muscles! Preferably, use both! Most important is to use your environment wisely. For example: if you're in a jungle biome, run into the trees and attack your enemies! If you're in a big NPC-village with iron golems: make your foe hit the Iron Golem, then run off and snipe the foe! If you're on a small island in an ocean biome: get a boat, sail a little away, and use your bow to take down that diamond-armor juggernaut! While in the Nether, surprise the enemy with a bed and kill them with the explosion! While in The End, spleef your enemy into the void for a sure victory! It will all be yours if you succeed! Your sword might be a strong weapon, but your bow is even stronger if you use your mind. Also, don't be scared to use potions: they can give you a great advantage over your non-potion using enemies.
** Evaluate your position. In other words, take into account all your advantages, all their advantages, and weigh the options. Sometimes, you need to guess and check. The most important ones are your advantages or disadvantages in **
1. Armor and armor enchants
2. Swords and sword Enchants
3. Bows and bow Enchants
4. Ender pearl or portal availability
5. Potions, skill, and hunger

The most iffy is skill. Some people are so good with their timing that they can calmly mine and take their diamond ore, then swing around and shoot just as soon as you are within a block of them!

In fact, who says you need better equipment to win? Let's say that your base is in the sky with a public chest containing some equipment. Then, all of a sudden, you come down with one teammate and realize that the base is being raided! In the chest, you find some string and cobblestone. The enemies are in iron armor, but enchantments are unknown due to this being before the 1.3 update. Now, if the raider's armor was not enchanted, then you're in luck. A stone sword against iron armor with no buffs deals a full heart of damage. A fully charged bow does about as much damage as a diamond sword. Even if you have no armor, you still somewhat stand a chance against those two since it's you and your teammate fighting them. You do not need to be the same size as long as you can beat them. If you and your teammate are strategic, let's say they stick together, and your enemy doesn't, then you are almost guaranteed to kill them, that is if both of you have at least stone swords and they are alone with an iron sword and full iron armor. If you got lucky enough to mine a diamond sword, bring that out too: if you can, enchant with even just Sharpness I, which will do about 5 hearts every hit. If you somehow have gotten a Strength II potion, maybe by buying it on a server, then DRINK IT! It will multiply your damage by 3.6, so that 5, if you make that a critical hit (by falling when attacking) (will do 7 hearts) WITH Strength II, then you just might have killed your opponent in one or two hits.

** Get to your senses. **
You may be thinking that people who have lost so much that their anger is uncontrollable are going to go psycho to win and when people come with supreme equipment you should be scared out of your wits, since that "causes" adrenaline. No! Anger and fear are both factors to defeat. When either happens, whether it be an attempt to kill a player who has diamond armor with your fists or combat logging just because you are so scared that you have to go to the bathroom of fear of peeing in your pants, you will most likely forget all the tips you have learned until you get back to your senses. Avoid that. Now, you must stay calm. Run for cover, and don't stop to watch the deaths of your teammates. If you have one, drink a Potion of Swiftness (the second tier is highly recommended), and keep running. Do not turn back, do not look back, do think of what's back there, and do not stop. Just keep running until you reach safety, whether it be allied or peaceful territory, or a secret place. Don't stop. Stay sharp.

** Peace, dude. **
Remember what's been said about not trusting anyone? Your turn to chip in to take a stab at backstabbing. Create peaceful factions for your team. Their only purpose is to earn supplies while being impossible to touch.

** Diamonds aren't the key to victory. **
If two players in diamond with enchantments come and raid your base, and you're 4 people in iron, and only you have a full set of diamond equipment, do not bring it out! It is obvious you don't stand much chance as you are overpowered. You do, however, need to keep potions. They should consist of the following:

Poison+Speed+Strength
Also, keep flint and steel, along with fire aspect swords and bows, along with you. And if you find generation errors that create gateways to the Void, use them. Don't forget to keep your dispensers loaded and ready to fire with arrows, damage splash potions, and fire charges. The reason why this equipment and these traps can beat people in diamond is because they go right through their armor. Nothing, not even diamond armor, can resist their effects (except for arrows. Fire, potion effects and Void damage are the only lethal things unaffected no matter what kind of armor.). Also, a potion of invisibility will mean no one will know where you are attacking from!

Also, remember the gift of decoys. Say you have nothing at all and you were just a player that started in a faction war faction. Use your expendable condition. Say there is a hall of traps designed by a redstone scientist. Throw yourself at the traps, run like a madman, break those hidden redstone clocks, and just kill your player on those lethal traps so your faction can zip in and break a hole in their obsidian shield. To victory!

** In and out **
On some servers, the PVP can take place in real life, as well. If you have many friends who play Minecraft, you can call them to join your (allied) faction, which will make strength in numbers. If one of your friends is good at persuading or knows a lot about strategy, that's even better! Also, if you know your in-game enemy well in real life, you can somehow reduce the time they can play or have a talk with them, so they may have a change of heart.

** Attack his weak point **
No matter how your opponent fights, they are bound to have some kind of weakness. Wastefully attacking where they are well defended won't work, and you will usually have to change your plan accordingly. Is he not using a shield? Abuse yours extra hard by blocking all his hits. Debuffing you with splash potions? Chug some milk. Shielding your arrows and tridents? Whip out the Piercing enchantment. Not even the heavily-geared Netherite player is invincible: you can bypass his armor with splash potions and tipped arrows. This also brings to the next point:

** Be one step ahead of your foe **
Just as you adapt to your opponent's tactics, your opponent will adapt to your tactics. If you see your opponent change his actions, think about why he is doing that. Don't rashly play into his hands. If your opponent just placed blocks to stop you from shooting him, stop shooting him and attack up close. Just as your opponent counters your actions, you need to counter his actions. Your plan of bypassing his Protection IV Netherite Armor with tipped arrows may be a sound plan, but if he starts holding down his shield, you'll have to change. If you, say, start shooting with your Piercing Crossbow then you're golden. As long as you are devising and implementing counters to your opponent's counterplay, then until your opponent figures out what to do in response, you have the advantage and you should press it. The longer one plays reactively rather than proactively, the more of a disadvantage they are at.

#### Trick the enemy
It is said above regarding running in traps (refer to "Diamonds aren't the key to victory") being a tactic that will fool the enemy, this makes it a rather effective attack. Always use psychology as a weapon! When running into a row of tripwires, the enemy might find it as a suicide attempt and not as a double trap, although not likely since most people will tend to just chase you. However, if you have a circuit that makes it so that the first time somebody runs through it, there is a chance your enemy may think that it's a dud or just a scare for the raiders. Once they step over it, though, the trap activates. This makes it useful since it can make the enemy think you are intending to run away when you're instead luring them into a death trap. If you have any type of invisibility potion or maybe you are just good at not being noticed, you can easily lure the enemy away from your actual position, then jump-attack them when they are least expecting it. This can be the key to a neck-and-neck battle, where your enemy's equipment is as good as yours.
