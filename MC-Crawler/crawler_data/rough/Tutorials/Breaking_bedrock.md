# Tutorials/Breaking bedrock
Bedrock is a block that is not intended to be broken in Survival mode. Despite this, it is still possible to break the unbreakable blocks in Survival mode without cheats. Bug exploits are used to achieve this, so these methods could be rendered useless in any update. Breaking bedrock is also more difficult than phasing through it, both of which are covered in this article.

Note that these methods can also be used to break other unbreakable blocks (though bedrock is the most useful) and regular breakable blocks (the player will not be able to collect any of the blocks broken, and they are much easier to break using tools).

## 
It may seem pointless to go through the effort of going through or breaking bedrock, but it is actually quite useful. Many players use this mechanism to travel large distances across the Nether. The most common use of these techniques is to make an easy access point to the top half of the Nether by phasing through the top layer of bedrock and then breaking the bedrock to put up a ladder or elevator to the top. Breaking bedrock is also useful if the player wants to fall into the void in the Overworld or Nether. It is also useful for breaking some of the blocks on the end gateways and the exit portal in the End. These same techniques can also be used to break the frames around the end portal in a stronghold.

## Phasing through bedrock
This section is about going through the bedrock. The only logical reason to do this instead of breaking the bedrock is going up through the bedrock in the Nether ceiling. It is recommended to bring the materials to build and light a Nether Portal with you to get back safely, as most of these methods cannot be reversed. 

In Bedrock Edition, the Nether build limit is 128 and above bedrock, so it is not recommended to phase through the bedrock. However, if you have already broken bedrock somewhere else, you can phase through the bedrock to return to a destination more easily.

### Method 1
This method works by placing a boat just below the nether ceiling and jumping out. This video shows how to do it and more information is in the description.

### Method 2
To use this method, you will need the following materials:

- Someender pearls.

The optimal strategy involves only one ender pearl if done correctly, though more may be brought just in case. Find a two block tall space to stand in just under the topmost block of the Nether, and make sure there is a two block wide (or one block wide, though it will be more difficult), one block tall space in front of your eyes. Throw your pearl horizontally into this space and jump. Prior to jumping, you should be suffocating in the bedrock. It is very easy if you look at the left/right edge of the surface you are facing and hold forward when jumping(only requires a one block  spaced crawl).

Pros:

- It is easy to get all the materials needed.
- It is easy to do once you get the hang of it.

Cons:

- It may take many stacks ofender pearlsto work.
- There is a possibility ofdeathdue todamagefrom ender pearls.

You will need an axe too.

### Method 2b
[Bug Used: MC-2164]

This method requires ender pearls. It was much easier to do in update 1.8, but is still possible in later versions.

Dig up to where the player would be "bumping" its head on the top layer of bedrock (on y = 127). Then, look straight up and throw the ender pearls as quickly as you can. This is more difficult to do in versions 1.9 and above due to the item cool-down. It works by having one of the ender pearls glitch and teleport the player into the block such that when the next ender pearl is thrown, it goes above the block and teleports the player to the top of the block.

Pros:

- It is easy to get all the materials needed.
- It is easy to do once you get the hang of it.

Cons:

- It may take many stacks ofender pearlsto work.
- There is a possibility ofdeathdue todamagefrom ender pearls.

### Method 3
This method is by far the easiest among all of them.

This variation uses the same resources and:

- 1stair
- 1ender pearl

Dig up to bedrock with Y at least 126. Place the stair towards the side just under the bedrock, then throw the ender pearl above it and you will be teleported to the top of the stair. Just jump and you can go out.

Pros:

- If the bedrock is at Y=127, only fall damage is taken, not suffocation damage.
- It is easy to accomplish.
- It is easy to get all the materials needed.
- You do not need to react quickly.

### Outdated
#### Method 4
An easy and cheap method that doesn't make the player take damage.
You'll need:

- 10-14 or more obsidian, depending on the size of the portal.
- AFlint and steel.

Creates a nether portal in the y axis=130 or higher. It'll create a nether portal above the bedrock layer.

Pros:

- You'll not be damaged in this method.
- No bugs or glitches needed for this method.
- You do not need to react quickly.
- A very cheap method, only need obsidian (or some buckets of lava and water) and a flint and steel.
- It's very easy to get back, as you only need to get in the nether portal and return to the Overworld.

Cons:

- This could affect the redirection of the nether portals near it.

#### Method 5
[Bug Used: MC-84198] (fixed)

This method requires that the player has already journeyed to the End and reached the outer End islands. This is very important.

To use this method, you need the following materials:

- at least 1chorus fruit
- up to 40 stacks of any type ofblocks

First, fill in an area that is 17Ã—17 blocks by 9 blocks high against the bedrock ceiling. The netherrack and bedrock that generates naturally can be used to fill in this region: only remaining air blocks need to be filled. Once this happens, stand in the middle of the top of this filled-in area (against the bedrock ceiling), and record your coordinates. Then, eat the chorus fruit. If the player is not teleported on top of the bedrock, eat another chorus fruit until you are successful. It works using a chorus fruit's teleportation ability and removing all other valid places for the player to teleport to. [verify]

Pros:

- It can be reversed by placing another region of blocks with 8 blocks in each direction on top of the bedrock ceiling, and then eating anotherchorus fruit.
- It is easy to accomplish.

Cons:

- It requires that theplayerhas already journeyed to the outerEndislands to harvestchorus fruit.
- The chance of success is random, so it is possible that it will take a huge quantity ofchorus fruit.

#### Method 6
[Bug Used: MC-3328] (fixed)

This method is cheap, but also has the highest chance of death. It has two variations, depending on how quick you are with placing blocks.

To use this method, you need the following materials:

- 1rail
- 1 solidblock
- 1minecart
- 1-2ender pearls
- Helmetenchanted withRespirationor Protection or aqua affinity (recommended, but not required)

Dig up to the highest level of bedrock (y = 127). Place a block (if needed) two blocks below it, and then place the rail on top of this block. There should be no gap between the rail and the upper layer of bedrock. Next, place a minecart on the rail. This is where it gets dangerous, and where the Respiration-enchanted helmet comes into play. Get inside the minecart and quickly dismount it. The player should be suffocating in the bedrock layer. Next, hold down the "jump" key and throw an ender pearl directly up. In case of this failing, throw another ender pearl directly upward. It works by having the minecart dismount the player in a position where the player will be able to jump and see the top of the bedrock. The ender pearls move the player to the top.

Pros:

- It is very cheap and could be done early in the game

Cons:

- If the player runs out of ender pearls, it is stuck in thebedrockceiling with absolutely no method of escape.
- There is an extremely high possibility ofdeath, and the drops will most likely land on top of the bedrock.
- It is hard to accomplish

#### Method 6b
[Bug Used: MC-3328] (fixed)

This variation use the same resources and:

- 1 morerail(any kind)
- 1 moreminecart
- 1slab
- 1piston
- 1lever

Begin in the same way as in Method 4: Place the first minecart just under the bedrock ceiling as in Method 4, enter the minecart, and then exit the minecart. You will begin suffocating in the bedrock ceiling. From there, jump up and down so that you can see the top of the bedrock. Place a rail on top of the bedrock, preferably close to where you will be coming out. Next, place a minecart on top of the rail and quickly ride it. You will be teleported to the top of the bedrock ceiling into the minecart and can exit without further risk of suffocation.

Pros:

- It is not as dangerous as using ender pearls; only suffocation damage is taken, not fall damage.
- Though uncomfortable, it can be used as part of a minecart elevator to get above the bedrock until the player gets the necessary tools to break the bedrock.

Cons:

- Depending on how close the rail was placed, it can be difficult to place the minecart and get inside it without the minecart being pushed off, though the player can still enter the minecart if it is still in range.
- It is easy to lose the exact location of where the player came up. Using the F3 screen (Java edition) to note the exact coordinates mitigates this.

#### Method 6c
[Bug Used: MC-3328] (fixed)

This variation requires an extra minecart, one piston, one slab, and one lever.

Begin in the same way as in Method 4: place a minecart under the bedrock ceiling, then break the rail under the minecart. Place the piston to face the minecart with one air block between them. On the space between the piston and the minecart, place a lower slab. Activate the piston to push the slab right on the minecart. Then break the piston and the lever. Enter the minecart, and dismount it quickly. You now should be glitched through the bedrock block without taking any further damage. Now finish like in method 2: place a rail and a minecart (or alternately, place a boat) and jump in.

Pros:

- It is not as dangerous as the previous methods; the only suffocation damage is taken when you jump in the first minecart.
- You do not need to react quickly.

Cons:

- It may be difficult to find an appropriate place in the roof to put it in place.
- It is easy to lose the exact location of where the player came up. Using the F3 screen (Java edition) to note the exact coordinates mitigates this.

### Method 7
Place a piston down just below topmost Bedrock layer so that it is pointing upwards. Place a rail on top of it, place a minecart on the rail and destroy the rail. Extend the piston so that it crushes the minecart slightly into the Bedrock. Jump in the minecart and dismount. You should be suffocating inside the Bedrock. Jump twice and you should end up above the Bedrock. After that, use the glitched minecart to go down. This glitch is for 18w11a only.

## Breaking bedrock
Depending on the method, breaking bedrock can either be a simple build, or a complex process.

** Needs **
- 2pistons
- 2TNT
- 1lever
- 1trapdoor
- 2blocks
- A 3Ã—2Ã—2 space

** Pros **
- Cheap, fast and easy
- Small contraption

** Cons **
- Needs a fast-paced clicking, or an autoclicker
- Will do around 3points ofdamageto the player.
- Only breaks 1 block per 2 TNT used



### Method 1
[Bug Used: MC-27056]

This method uses update priority and headless pistons to break bedrock. While it can seem needlessly complex to do this for one block of bedrock, it is the preferred method to destroy large quantities of bedrock.

** Needs (mostly not counted, since there are many ways to use this method) **
- Sticky pistons
- Pistons
- Redstone repeaters
- Redstone comparators
- Redstone blocks
- Redstone
- Blocksof any kind
- Obsidian[note 1]
- Rails, 1powered rail, 1activator rail[note 1]
- 1minecart with TNT[note 1][note 2]
- 1lever[note 1]

This other video by EDDxample showcases a high-end automatic bedrock breaker:




** Pros **
- It can be done early in the game to clear a few bedrock blocks, since it does not require many resources.
- It can be done quickly after some practice.
- It can be easily extented to make some more automated machines.

** Cons **
- It is very complicated, and one mistake means having to completely start over.

### Method 2
This method requires a one block deep 1Ã—4 block trench in the bedrock directly above the Nether portal that brought you to the Nether. It only works with the ceiling of the Nether and requires that there are no other portals within 16 blocks in the Nether or 128 blocks in the Overworld. These are the materials you will need:

- A lot of transparent, non-spawnable blocks (glass,slabs, etc.) [note 1]

Note: This amount can change drastically depending on the situation.

1. Place the non-spawnable blocks on every top surface of every block within 16 blocks horizontally and all the way up and down between the bedrock barriers.
2. Break the Nether portal that brought the player to the Nether.
3. Build another Nether portal at least 16 blocks away and use it to travel back to the Overworld.
4. Go back to the original portal and use it to go back to the Nether. This portal should spawn at the Nether ceiling, breaking some more of the bedrock. Repeat this to break more bedrock.

This method works by removing all of the valid places for a Nether portal. It forces the portal to generate in the bedrock, replacing some of it with the obsidian frame.

Pros:

- It is incredibly easy to accomplish.
- It is very fast.

Cons:

- It requires a lot of work to prepare the area.
- It requires the player to have already used one of the methods above to break the bedrock needed to utilize this.

Revised method using portals:




### Redstone Lag method
This method requires a number of pistons (for example, to break one bedrock, you need 2 pistons), a trapdoor, a lot of redstone, a lever, a full beacon powered with Haste II, a maxed out pickaxe and some temporary blocks. It also needs a mod called Tweakeroo.

First, place a lever and surround all sides of it with redstone. More redstone placed means the lag will last longer, but sometimes, the bedrock won't break if the lag is too long, so you would need to be precise. Set up a Haste II beacon, go to Tweakeroo settings, in the Generic tab, find "Fast Right Click Count" and set it to a number (in the tutorial it's 32), then in the Tweaks tab, find "Tweak Fast Right Click" and set it to true and optionally set a hotkey if you want. Then place a forward facing piston, a block on top, a redstone block on top of the block, a block beside the piston which would activate it, break the redstone block, place a trapdoor on the back of the piston, and right click on it, turn on the fast right click tweak and hold your right click, but make sure not to hold it too long. Then go to your piston, break the block beside the piston, enter crawl mode, break the piston (but make sure not to break the detached piston arm), and place down another piston, wait for a while and the piston should face forward again, break the piston and you would see it broke a piece of bedrock.

More information here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUfFWr9WCAs

Pros:

- You can repeat this process without losing any materials, unlike the method which uses pistons and TNT.
- Can break multiple bedrock blocks at once

Cons:

- Quite expensive (needs a good pickaxe and a full Haste II beacon)
- Might take multiple attempts to successfully finish
- Requires a mod
- Because of the lag, if you have elytra on, you will behave weirdly if you open your elytra (minor issue)

(Bug MC-213813)

This method requires snapshot 21w05a due to the use of dripleaves.

It has been patched in snapshot 21w06a.

#### Needs
- 1Claypersmall dripleaf
- someBone Meal
- 1small dripleafper bedrock broken
- Shearsto break the dripleaves

#### Pros
- Very easy to do, requires few materials
- Materials can be reused continuously

#### Cons
- Can use up a lot of bone meal depending on luck

### Outdated


#### Method 3
Introduced in 1.17.0 and patched in 1.17.30 and above.

This easy method â€Œ[Bedrock Edition  only] uses powder snow. 

You will only need:

- 2 buckets of powder snow
- 1 cauldron

1. Place the cauldron underneath the bedrock you want to break
2. Use the buckets of powder snow on the cauldron and the powder snow will replace the bedrock

##### Pros
- Few materials required
- Reusable
- Easy to use

#### Method 4
[Bug Used: MC-91486], patched in 1.13 and above.

This method is much simpler, but it requires more resources. These are the minimum materials you will need to break one block:

- Onedragon egg
- One piston
- Oneredstone torch
- 31-481 redstone[note 1]
- 33-513 blocks of choice[note 1]
- 2-32 redstone repeaters[note 1]
- 1 lever

1. â†‘ a b cThis amount varies greatly on render distance. The amount of redstone you will need is 15 times the render distance. The number of repeaters you will need is the same as the render distance. The number of blocks you will need is 16 times the render distance, plus 1.

This method is incredibly easy to do, but time-consuming. This is all you need to do:

1. Place one block of choice.
2. Place a redstone torch on the side of this block.
3. Place a piston on top of the redstone torch.
4. Place the dragon egg on top of the piston arm. This dragon egg should be exactly above the block you are trying to break.
5. Place the remaining blocks in a straight line with redstone on top of it. Place repeaters every 16 blocks of this redstone line. At the other end of this, place a lever.
6. Power the lever, wait five seconds, then depower it.
7. Walk back to find the dragon egg taking up the space of the broken block.

This works because the dragon egg is dropped in the lazy chunks. Lazy chunks are a region two chunks wide at the edge of the player's render distance that are partly loaded and have not yet been unloaded. Redstone still works, but falling block entities fall instantly. Dragon eggs have the strange property where they replace the block they fall on with itself, if they fall in the lazy chunks.

Pros:

- It can be expanded to break more bedrock in one go, if the player manages to obtain more dragon eggs. This can be done using agravity block duplicator.
- Since it uses a falling block, the player can construct this any number of blocks above the one being broken.

Cons:

- This method requires a block underneath the target block for the dragon egg to rest on after it falls. The egg will keep breaking blocks under it until it comes to rest on a solid block, which cannot exist at y=0.
- On multiplayer, other players may end up loading the chunks where this is happening, causing it to fail.
- It requires that you obtain a dragon egg, which might require lots of convincing other players in multiplayer if you weren't the first person to kill the Ender Dragon.

#### Method 5
This can be done in a variety of different ways because it uses certain plants with block-breaking properties.

##### Bamboo
In Bedrock Edition, growing bamboo with bone meal removes the block above. See this video for how to quickly remove strips of bedrock.
This method no longer works in 1.10.0.

##### Jungle Trees
(Bug Used: MC-10176) (patched)

The branches of huge jungle trees replace blocks that they generate in.

##### Huge Mushrooms
Huge mushrooms break the blocks that their caps spawn in.

This method no longer works in 1.13.2

Pros:

- These plants are extraordinarily easy to obtain.
- The method is cheap, requiring just a bit of bonemeal.

Cons:

- Plants are unpredictable, so you could be breaking blocks that you did not want to break.
- These plants have very strict space requirements, so fulfilling those and breaking the bedrock can take a lot of trial-and-error.

#### Method 6
(Bug used: MC-91528)

As of Minecraft 1.13, this method no longer works as described.

This method requires an indestructible end crystal and a piston.

To do this, push the end crystal with the piston into the block that you want to break. The block will break.

It works because indestructible end crystals constantly generate fire underneath them. This fire breaks all blocks, including bedrock.

Pros:

- It is insanely easy to accomplish once the materials are obtained.
- Lots of bedrock can be removed quickly with this method, through the use of a flying machine.

Cons:

- Indestructible end crystals are very difficult to obtain and move.
- It can be difficult to tell which block is being removed.

Fun fact: In the 1.8 update, no bedrock generated on the obsidian pillars because the crystals generated one block lower than they were supposed to. The fire generated broke the bedrock that was supposed to be there.
