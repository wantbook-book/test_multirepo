## The End
Or the beginning?

Requirements: Enter the End dimension.

You need to enter the End dimension, by going through an end portal (this is the same as The End? advancement from the Minecraft tab). Once the terrain forms, you will get the advancement.

Parent of: Free the End

## Free the End
Good luck

Requirements: Kill the Ender Dragon for the first time.

Deliver the last hit to the ender dragon. If there are multiple players participating in the fight, only the player that deals the last hit to the dragon will get the advancement. 

The finishing blow has to be direct damage from the player. This includes:

1. A melee hit (sword,axe, etc.),
2. Arrowshot from abow/crossbow,
3. Explosivefirework rocketshot from a crossbow or placed directly on the ground by the player,
4. Throwntrident,
5. Explosion ofTNTlighteddirectlyby the player (usingflint and steelor a fiery arrow),
6. Explosion of anend crystalpunched/shot by the player,
7. A splash or lingering potion ofHarming, thrown by the player.

The advancement can not be obtained if the dragon dies from other causes, e.g.:

1. Bedorrespawn anchorexplosion,
2. TNT lighted by a redstone component, even in that component was activated by a player,
3. Fireworks shot fromdispensers,
4. Mob exploding or shooting an explosive projectile.

See this tutorial on how to kill the ender dragon for a proper guide.

## The Next Generation
Hold the Dragon Egg

Requirements: Have a dragon egg in your inventory.

Dragon egg spawns on top of the exit portal after defeating the first ender dragon.

Note that this advancement, despite being relatively easy to get, has the potential for being irreversibly screwed up. The dragon egg spawns only once per world, and if you lose it, this advancement becomes impossible to obtain. On a normal Survival world, no other advancement has such property.

Trying to mine the egg will cause it to teleport to another location in a 15 block radius. It has a small chance to teleport inside the portal and go through it to the Overworld, landing at world spawn. Additionally, the landing location has a small chance to be a non-solid block, like a flower. If the dragon egg falls on top of that block, it will drop as an item and despawn after 5 minutes, as world spawn chunks are always loaded, no matter where the player is (even in another dimension!). Thus it's not recommended to just punch the egg, if you want to guarantee getting this advancement.

The easiest way for the dragon egg to drop as an item is to place a piston facing the egg with a lever next to it. Build a small platform around the egg to ensure that it doesn't drop into the portal. Flip the lever to push the piston, which will make the dragon egg drop as an item.

Simplest way to guarantee obtaining the egg
Alternatively, if you don't mind the small chance of the egg teleporting to Overworld, there is a simpler way of obtaining this advancement:

1. Punch the egg. It will most likely teleport to anend stoneblock nearby.
2. Take one of thetorchesfrom the exit portal.
3. Dig one block under the block the dragon egg is sitting on and place a torch there.
4. Break the block the dragon egg is sitting on. The dragon egg will fall on the torch, then drop as an item.

Any non-full block will work in place of the torch (such as a bottom slab, pressure plate, button etc.). However, the usage of torches is suggested, as they are cheap and easy to obtain.

As soon as you get the egg into your inventory, you will be rewarded the advancement.

## Remote Getaway
Escape the island

Requirements: Enter an end gateway.

Enter an end gateway, which spawns after an ender dragon is defeated. Because the gateway opening is only one block high, you cannot walk in directly. You can either throw an ender pearl through, or force your player model in crawling position, most easily achieved with a trapdoor or a water bucket. 

Entering the gateway will grand you this advancement and teleport you to one of the outer islands in the End, which is the only place where end cities can be found.

## The End... Again...
Respawn the Ender Dragon

Requirements: Respawn the ender dragon using end crystals.

Respawning the ender dragon is possible by placing four end crystals on certain blocks of bedrock that surround the exit portal in the End. To craft end crystals, you need ghast tears (dropped from ghasts), some glass and eyes of ender.

| Ingredients                             | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Glass+<br/>Eye of Ender+<br/>Ghast Tear |                 |

The exit portal is surrounded by three bedrock blocks on each side, with blocks connecting each of the sides, for a total of 16 blocks. Place an end crystal on these 3-block lines on each of the sides. An example configuration is shown below.

This arrangement of end crystals on the End's exit portal will respawn the ender dragon.
Placing the crystals will start the respawning sequence: exit portal will turn off and end crystals on the obsidian towers will start regenerating one by one. At the end of the sequence, ender dragon will be reborn, and as soon as this happens, you will get the advancement.

Note that this should not be done if you haven't collected the dragon egg yet, because new dragon will destroy it and you will lose the only chance to get The Next Generation advancement.

## You Need a Mint
Collect dragon's breath in a glass bottle

Requirements: Have a bottle of dragon's breath in your inventory.

To collect the dragon's breath, use a glass bottle on the dragon's breath particles: either when it lands on the exit portal and breathes on the ground, or on particles from its fireball. Note that breath of the dragon deals high magic damage!

You will get the advancement as soon as there is a bottle of dragon's breath in your inventory.

## The City at the End of the Game
Go on in, what could happen?

Requirements: Enter an end city.

You can find end cities on the outer islands of the End, accessible through an end gateway. Note that end cities are rather rare and you might need to look for quite a while before you find one. It is recommended to take on this journey as many blocks as possible (or at least a good pickaxe to mine end stone), for creating bridges between end islands.

End cities, guarded by shulkers, can contain lots of valuable treasure: high-enchanted iron and diamond armor, swords, pickaxes and shovels, diamonds, iron and gold ingots, as well as elytra wings. For tips on how to conquer this place and get its loot, see this tutorial.

## 
Find Elytra

Requirements: Have a pair of Elytra in your inventory.

Elytra wings are one of the most valuable items in the game and can can be found exclusively in end city ships, sitting in an item frame behind a shulker guarding it. Again, for tips on how to conquer this place and get its loot, see this tutorial.

You will get the advancement as soon as there is an elytra in your inventory.

## Great View From Up Here
Levitate up 50 blocks from the attacks of a Shulker

Requirements: Travel 50 blocks vertically while being affected by Levitation.

Travel vertically for at least 50 blocks under the Levitation effect, which is acquired by getting hit by a shulker's projectile. Despite the advancement saying "Levitate up", it can be obtained by traveling either up or down.

Traveling up: It is possible, although very tricky, to do this advancement using no help from pearls or chorus. You would need a lot of shulker bullets constantly hitting you for about 30 seconds. Earning this advancement becomes significantly easier if you throw an ender pearl at an end city tower above you after gaining Levitation. To avoid dying from fall damage after the effect wears off, you can throw another ender pearl, glide down using elytra, try to position yourself just above a tower roof, place a water bucket where you intend to land, or wear boots enchanted with a high Feather Falling level.

Another way to complete the advancement is to make a 50 block tall tower. Place water at the top, and swim up once the shulker hits you.

Traveling down: You can get to the top of a tall end city (more than 50 blocks), and be hit by a shulker, granting Levitation. Next, get at least 8 blocks away from the end city, and then eat a chorus fruit. Because of the way chorus fruit teleportation works, it will teleport you directly on the ground, and you will get the advancement. An alternative to a chorus fruit is to throw an ender pearl at the ground below while you still have Levitation.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 50 experience.
