# Tutorials/Dual wielding
This tutorial will help you become familiar with dual wielding, a mechanic added in the Combat Update.

Note that dual-wielding in Bedrock Edition is much more limited.  Most items cannot be put into the off-hand slot.

## 
You can change your main hand in the options. This might be handy for players who are left-handed.
Before we begin the tutorial, it is important to recognize these two terms: main hand and off-hand. By default, the main hand is the player's right hand. Respectively, the player's off-hand is their left hand. Keep in mind that there is an option located in Skin Customization labeled "Main Hand" to swap the main hand and off-hand. This option may be helpful for players that are left-handed.

## 
Dual wielding is when you hold two weapons, one in each hand, during combat. Despite the fact that dual wielding is not widely practiced in real life, it is used in various action and role-playing games, and is generally designed to provide the player more effectiveness or convenience in battle. Dual wielding in Minecraft can be used in combat, but it also can be used in other everyday activities, such as building, mining, and eating. It does have a few major limits, but learning through them and applying dual wielding to practical use can give players a large boost in productivity and a greater advantage above other players in PvP combat in-game.

## How to equip something to your off-hand
The off-hand slot is highlighted on the bottom-right corner of the player avatar.
In the inventory, there is a slot in the bottom-right side of the player avatar that looks like an outline of a shield. This is called the off-hand, hand slot. When you put something in it, you should see it being held on your off-hand (your left hand on default). Your other hand should also appear on the screen in first person view (you should see two hands on the screen). You should also see an extra slot with the off-hand item appear beside your HUD hotbar; this should be on the opposite side of your main hand.

For easy equipping to the off-hand slot, press F by default in Java Edition. This is configurable in the Controls settings. Using this, you can quickly equip something into your off-hand slot in your inventory and switch between the items in your hotbar and off-hand.

## How the off-hand is used
"The use key will throw the ender pearl, because the sword doesn't have a 'use'."
The off-hand can use the item it holds when there are no items in the main hand, or the item held on the main hand is not usable, e.g. swords and pickaxes.

Arrows that are held on the off-hand take priority over arrows in any other slot when you shoot a bow. This allows you to fire a specific arrow by selecting it using your off-hand. Conveniently, you can do vice-versa and hold the bow on the off-hand with arrows selected on your main hand. This also allows you to fire a specific arrow by selecting it using your main hand.

If you have a crossbow and some firework rockets, though, you can put the latter in the off-hand slot and (even if you have normal arrows) fire just that.

## Limitations
"Attacking only swings my main hand. The off-hand can't be used for attacking."
| “ | You cannot dual wield weapons. Well, I mean, you could, but you can only attack from your main arm so it'll be pointless. | „ |

Though putting two weapons into your main and offhand is pretty useless as stated, the Mending effect is still used, meaning you can grind XP and repair tools.

Players cannot use both hands at the same time, and there is always a slight delay between using the main hand and off-hand. Thus you cannot instantly perform two actions together, such as placing and breaking blocks simultaneously or shooting two bows at once.

The main hand always takes priority when trying to use an item. For example, if you had stone in your main hand and dirt in your off-hand, you will always place the stone. The item in the off-hand will only be used if the item in the main hand lacks a use, or if it's holding nothing. If the item in the main hand cannot be used due to certain circumstances, then the off-hand is used. For example, if you have a block equipped on the main hand and a snowball on the off-hand, face anywhere you cannot reach a block (e.g. into the sky), and then press use, the snowball will be thrown instead of placing the block. This is because the block cannot be placed anywhere, and so your off-hand is used instead.

The main hand is also the only hand that can hit or break, even if there are no items in the main hand. This means that items in the off-hand lose their left-click function, making most weapons and tools unusable in the off-hand, with the exception of ones that have a use function.

Weapons that can be used on the off-hand in Java Edition:

- Bow
- Chicken eggs
- Lingering Potions
- Snowballs
- Splash Potions
- Trident
- Crossbow

Tools that can be used on the off-hand in Java Edition:

- Arrow
- Bucket
- Ender Pearl
- Fishing Rod
- Flint and Steel
- Hoe(useondirtto turn it intofarmland)
- Lead
- Shears(useon asheepto cut off itswoolor on apumpkinto carve it)
- Shield
- Shovel(useon agrass block,podzol,mycelium,dirtorcoarse dirtto turn it into apath)
- Axe(useon alogorwoodto turn it into astripped logorstripped wood)
- Torch
- Firework Rocket
- Potions
- Totem of Undying
- Map

Tools that can be used on the off-hand in Bedrock Edition:

- Shield
- Totem of Undying
- Map
- Arrow
- Firework Rocket

## Summary
- Players can now use both hands to do different actions with the left and right mouse buttons.
	- For example, if a player has a pickaxe in their main hand and a torch in their off-hand, right-clicking will place the torch.
		- This happens because a pickaxe lacks a right-click use, and therefore the game tries to then treat the other item as if it's being right-clicked.
- Players can put an item on the "off-hand slot" in their inventory to hold it on their off-hand.
	- It is distinguished by an outline of a shield like symbol.
	- PressingF(by default) will switch whatever item is selected in the hotbar with the item in the off-hand (including no item).
	- The off-hand slot is displayed next to the HUD when it's not empty (left for right-handed players and vice versa).
- Only the main hand can be used for attacking or breaking.
	- An exception is items which do damage uponusingthem, such as bows or splash potions.
- Bows determine what type of arrow to shoot based on the player's inventory and off-hand.
	- Arrows in the off-hand take priority over arrows in any other slot.
		- Otherwise, the closest stack of arrows to the first slot is used.
	- If the bow is in the off-hand, the selected hotbar slot takes priority.
	- If there are multiple arrow types and none held on the off-hand or main hand, the arrow on the first hotbar slot will shoot first.
- The off-hand is invisible in first person view while it's empty.

### Final note
Dual wielding a pickaxe in the main hand and a torch in the off-hand. This reduces the time lighting up tunnels when mining.
Dual wielding is a useful addition to the game with many applications. It is entirely optional for players whether or not they want to utilize dual wielding; players can completely ignore the off-hand slot and, with few exceptions aside, continue to play like it was before 1.9. Some players who use dual wielding may experience efficiency and relief, but others may just experience more setbacks. Some may only use dual wielding to its minimal extent. Ultimately it is up to each player and their own style of playing to employ this mechanic into their gameplay.

Simply holding right-click will eat the food in the off-hand slot, regardless of what item is in the main hand, saving time as the player does not have to select the food in the hotbar. Food is not wasted as you can't consume food when theHunger Baris full. Having your food in the off-hand also frees a space on your hotbar, so you can put another item to use.Equipping a Golden Apple on your off-hand allows you to quickly eat your apple before going immediately into combat with your opponent, but do note that you can consume a golden apple while your hunger is still full, so this method may be reserved until you are certain that you will go into battle soon. |
