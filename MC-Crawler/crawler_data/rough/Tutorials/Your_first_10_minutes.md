## Dawn
Wherever you spawn in the world, there are several different landscapes all around you. Your goal is to gather all the resources you need before nighttime comes and monsters can spawn.

### Minute Zero
0:00–0:15

It is best to create a temporary landmark to indicate the spawn location before you move at all. This might help you in the future in case you ever get lost, so mark it in whichever way you can. If you spawn on land, the easiest way is to dig the blocks adjacent to the block you are standing on and then place one on top of the other to form a pillar below your feet. See pillar jumping for more detail. Build the marker on nearby high ground, and build it high enough to be seen from a distance over any nearby obstacles. Next, look around and take note of your surroundings. See if there are any trees around you. There is a spawn chunk region, and you respawn anywhere within that region if you die. This region has special importance in the game, and you want to lay down enough markings to be able to identify it later. (Pro-tip for direction finding: you are always facing north at the start of the game. Pressing F3 to open the debug screen, and looking on the left side of the text also tells you where you are facing, as well as your x, y, and z coordinates, which you might want to write down.‌[JE  only])

0:20–1:00

Walk towards trees. If you do not see any trees, pick a random direction (but note the direction; the sun has just risen and is directly east, which you can also check in the Debug/F3 screen ‌[JE  only]) and walk. If you are on an island, surrounded by water, swim towards land. Throughout the first day, it's recommended to hit any short grass you come across as seeds are going to come in handy later on for Hunger. If you are in the jungle, keep an eye open for a big green melon and punch it if you see one. Also, take note of food sources such as animals, as well as small caves as shelter, as they become useful later on. If you have spawned in a plains, savanna, desert, taiga, snowy taiga‌[BE  only], or snowy tundra biome, you may come across a village. Villages have houses and villagers that can be used for trading with later on. Villager houses may contain basic food supplies such as bread, seeds, carrots, potatoes and beetroots, even melons or pumpkins, and hay bales which you can craft into wheat and then into bread. A weaponsmith contains a chest with excellent chest loot like iron. Villages also contain beds that allow you to reset your spawn point and avoid the effects of insomnia. A village can be a good start to building your own shelter early or late game, particularly in challenging biomes like desert or tundra.

### Minute One
1:00–2:00

If you still do not see trees, and particularly if you don't see any dirt or grass blocks, then start collecting sand (in a desert) or snow (in the tundra, although this requires obtaining a shovel) as shelter materials, as much as you can get, for 20 seconds, then move on. If you are still swimming, keep at it. If you do see a tree, cut it down by holding down destroy and collect all of the logs. After breaking down the logs from the tree, the leaves will automatically decay after a few minutes; if you don't want to wait you can always break the leaves and collect the saplings and apples that drop from the leaves, if there are any.

You should keep your eyes and ears open for animals such as chickens, cows, sheep, pigs, for food. You should see some animals in a couple of minutes. In some biomes wolves will spawn which can be domesticated at a later point in time with bones. You don't want to punch the wolves by accident. If you do, they become hostile.

### Minute Two
2:00–2:10

The next step after finding wood is to make a crafting table. If you have not found trees yet (or a village) keep moving until you do. If you have not found either after 5 minutes, you should stop and make a basic shelter (see next section). 

To make a crafting table, first open your inventory by pressing E. Put one piece of log anywhere in the 2×2 crafting slot near the top of your inventory. In the output box to the right of that, 4 planks appear. Take the planks, and put 1 in each slot of the crafting area. The output should now be a crafting table.

44444444444

Put the crafting table anywhere in your hotbar (the 9 slots at the bottom of your inventory), and place it down with a right-click, and right-click again to open it.

2:10-3:00


Make a wooden pickaxe and a wooden axe. First, you need to make sticks. (1 log = 4 planks = 8 sticks) This lets you get cobblestone and progress to better tools.

You should also make a boat if you're still on an island with very limited resources, which can be crafted with 5 planks.

### Minute Three
3:00–4:00

Dig down or into hills using your fist on the dirt, and then use the pickaxe to gather at least 19 blocks of stone, which drops as cobblestone when mined. This cobblestone enables you to build your first tools and a furnace.

This hole can be your first basic shelter if you want, so pick a suitable place. Remember to never mine straight down. Once you have stone tools, you can explore caves, so be on the lookout for a cave opening. These are quite easy to find, occurring in every biome, and contain ores, which give resources and are very useful. However, do not venture far into one this early in the game. If you see a monster in one, retreat right away, sealing the passage between you and the monster with basic blocks (dirt, etc.) as you currently don't have any weapons or armor.

Once you have cobblestone, place your crafting table again (if you moved it) and use it to make a stone axe (Surprisingly, this item deals more damage ‌[JE  only]), a stone pickaxe, and a stone sword. You may have to convert more wood into sticks.




It never hurts to get more wood, so try to have at least 10 logs for the night. It's okay if you don't get enough. you can collect more in the morning.

Break the crafting table, collect it, and remember your spawn point. You can use the coordinates from the F3 menu and/or take a screenshot.‌[JE  only]

### Minute Four
4:00–5:00

Now that you have a sword (or axe on Java Edition), you could start killing excess animals with it (any animals in excess of 2 of each type), and then collecting their drops, although food isn't a problem until your third day. When collecting meat exactly six of the same type is best for efficient cooking. Go after sheep if they're available because they drop wool, which is needed for a bed, and also give mutton for food. If you see a horse then generally don't kill it. Leave it alone for now — it only drops leather which is useless before you have access to enchanting, and taming it is pointless until you find a saddle. Don't waste your time if you are behind. Don't bother attacking wolves, as they don't have any item drops, are rather dangerous if you attack when starting out, and can be tamed with bones obtained from skeletons, turning them into wolves that can protect you. If you are lucky enough to run into cats, then don't kill them either, or even scare them away, as they can scare away creepers and can also be tamed with raw fish. Also, always make sure to leave at least 2 of every animal, so that you can breed them for later.

Try to find coal and a place for your first shelter. Hillsides are best for both. If you do not see coal, collect some more logs (and craft an axe if you skipped that earlier). If you are planning to grow crops at this shelter site, ensure there is water nearby.

## Midday
### Minute Five
5:00–6:00

Look for a hill or mountain near your pillar, as it lets you easily make a shelter and give you resources along the way.

If you see sheep, kill 3 of them, all the same color, to gather 3 blocks of wool (to make a bed). If you want to have an easier time later on by breeding sheep, leave at least 2 sheep alive. (It is still advised to kill sheep whenever you find them until you have three blocks of the same color of wool to make a bed, since a bed is extremely important and extra sheep can usually be found by exploring further.)

### Minute Six
6:00–7:00

Dig into that hill, or if you're in flat terrain into the ground. Don't get fancy if there isn't any water (or land), animals, or trees in sight because you won't be using it for more than one night. (An especially desperate shelter is a 3×1 hole in the ground with one block covering the top.) If you find a village, you could stay in one of its houses. Be careful if you are on easy to hard difficulty, as you may have to deal with zombies, or husks if you are in a desert.

### 
7:00–9:00

Build a basic shelter (worry about the size and looks later, focus on functionality). For now, build it with dirt and/or planks. If you have spawned in a desert biome (and collected sand during Minute One) sand walls and sandstone roof. 


If you are in tundra and have a shovel, you can build with snow blocks.

After shelter, food, and a bed, your highest priority on day 1 is a source of light. With light, you can work usefully during your first night. Without it, it is possible but if you leave, mobs could spawn and it is hard to see what you are doing in the dark. 

If you found and mined coal, craft some torches to light up the shelter.

4
If you did not find coal, build a furnace and make some charcoal from wood logs. This is a higher priority than food, as you shouldn't get too hungry until later in the game. However, you should avoid excess sprinting and jumping.

Place the crafting table and make a furnace.


Make your first charcoal (if needed) by smelting a log in a furnace.

77777777
Use this charcoal to cook up to 8 more logs. You can keep using this method to get charcoal until you find coal ore. The charcoal is used to make torches in the absence of coal (see the earlier torch recipe.) Make at least one batch of torches to keep your shelter lit at night, so you can work through the night. Make more batches if you plan on mining.

888888888
Make some torches as per the preceding section. Once you have a source of light, you can stop worrying about the impending darkness and do other tasks all night long. 

Earlier, you hopefully collected some meat by killing animals – "...at least three pieces of meat, exactly six is best." Now, it's time to cook it in a furnace with some planks:

3333322222222233333
If you spotted coal earlier, go and mine it while waiting for the meat to cook.

A furnace batch always takes ten seconds to complete. Coal and charcoal last 80 seconds, and so do 8 batches. Planks last 15 seconds, so two can do three batches. This is consistent for all furnace recipes, even ones late in the game.

88888888
See Smelting for the details.

If you have additional wood, make a wooden door. Zombies have the ability to break doors on hard mode, but if you are a beginner, you shouldn't be playing on hard mode anyway. Please keep this in mind when building your entrance/exit to your shelter. Place the door outside and place it on the outer side of the block of your entrance to the shelter.

33333333333
If you are out of wood, just place a couple of cheap blocks in the doorway until morning. You can make a door tomorrow.

### Minute Nine
9:00–10:00

Get ready for the night and craft a bed if you gathered wool. You need three wool blocks of the same color.


While you have this extra time, it would be a good idea to craft a chest to store unwanted and unnecessary items to carry around at all times such as seeds, eggs, leather, or extra food.


### Minute Ten
10:00
Go to bed. If you have not gathered enough wool for a bed to sleep in, or do not want to use one, first check to see if your base is secure (has all four walls, has a roof, a door or at least a blocked doorway, and ideally is lit). It is not recommended to add decorations to your house on the first day.

If you don't have enough wool (or wood) for a bed to sleep on, then, as long as you have a light source, you can use the night time more usefully by crafting or by starting to make a mine. From mines you can get lots of useful items such as iron, coal, redstone, gold, lapis lazuli, diamond, and emerald. Never dig straight down, as it is very dangerous. you could fall into a mob-filled cave, into lava, or fall into a large ravine. Mines are also a good way to find caves.

If you don't have enough coal or charcoal to make many torches for the mine, you can organize your items and house to make finding and moving easier, and do crafting (crafting is possible, though difficult, even in complete darkness). Also, if you managed to gather some leather (at least 4 pieces) by killing cows or rabbits, you might craft some leather armor. It's weak but better than nothing.

## Dusk
If you decide to start making a mine, there are many methods to dig for resources. While a safe method would be simply to dig a large room, lighting it up as you dig while looking for ores, a more profitable (and risky) decision would be to look for a cave and start spelunking. If you decide to find and explore caves, a sword, food, enough wood (20 to 30 logs) and a light source (presumably torches) are absolute necessities. If you come across any ore other than coal, or iron, get an iron pickaxe before you mine it, as using an inferior pickaxe not only takes longer to mine it, it breaks the ore without dropping the resource. You need ladders and a crafting table, just in case you find a good cave and decide to stay underground for long. 

If you run short on food, you can survive on rotten flesh dropped by zombies, but it is not as nutritious and can poison you with hunger for 30 seconds. If you are living on rotten flesh, it is best to wait until the hunger bar is low and then eat multiple rotten flesh in quick succession, because the hunger penalty doesn't stack (If you do get hunger penalty, stay still to prevent hunger loss). 

Be prepared for hostile mobs, as it is a common but fatal mistake for starters to think that the moon spawns hostile mobs, and not simply darkness. If you come back with enough iron, you can experience many more features of Minecraft, mainly redstone, pistons, diamond, and much more. You have started on your path to your success in Minecraft, whether you have found iron or not.

## Other options
One good idea is to chop an extra log and burn it for charcoal. With practice, you can start a new game and as long as you are near trees when you spawn, you should be able to make basic tools, a furnace and have enough wood for torches before midday (5:00).

Often people would rather use up wooden tools before switching to your newly made stone tools, but the stone tools really are better — if you don't want to "waste" the wooden tools, you can use them as fuel to smelt single items, or keep them as a trophy for late-game!

If possible, and if you can spot a position where you would like to build a house when you spawn, try to gather the resources from nearby, and only dig where you would otherwise dig to construct your house to save time later. Replant all saplings (which have a chance of falling when tree leaves are mined) as soon as they fall if this is the case so that you have less distance to walk later.

If you are more adventurous, find an ocean. As soon as you have a lot of wood blocks, build the crafting table and wooden axe as above, then build 3 or 4 boats and go sailing. Spend nights at sea while perusing the coastline for a nice place to make your base. Once you do, put ashore at dawn and proceed with the guidelines above.
