# Tutorials/Wool farming
You can get wool by shearing sheep, killing sheep, or crafting it out of string. Shearing sheep is often advantageous as it means that they can regrow their wool by eating grass. They will eat grass soon after it grows, Observers can be used to detect grass being eaten and activate dispensers, which can shear sheep if their hitbox is in the block in front of the dispenser.

The wool will fall off and will usually go into a hopper for collection.

Sheep will also regrow wool regularly. The chance of eating grass is 1⁄1000 per game tick, so a sheep is 63% likely to regrow new wool after 50 seconds, and over 90% likely to regrow new wool after 2 minutes.[1]

## Automatic sheep shearing design
There are many designs that can be stacked to make large wool farms. The sheep can also be dyed to produce different wool colors.

### How to build an automatic wool farm
1. Place down adispenserfacing horizontally.
2. Lay down grass blocks 1 block lower and one block in front of the dispenser.
3. Build a pen out of glass (preferably the color of the sheep).
4. Lure a sheep inside or create a piston contraption to move the sheep into the pen.
5. Put anobserverunderneath the dispenser facing at the grass block to power the dispenser,
6. Then put a piece ofRedstone Duston top of the block behind theObserver(which is in behind the dispenser) to power theDispenser.
7. Put a shear into the dispenser.
8. Placeminecartswithhoppersunderneath the grass to collect the items.
9. Make a room full of chests that the minecarts bring the wool into.

### An Infinite Automatic Wool Farm
This machine provides you with infinite wool and does not take many resources at all. After building the machine, all you have to do is replace the shears if they break, which does not happen very often.

Construction

1. Build a 1 by 1dirtplatform and surround it with a wall that is as high as you want to be made ofglassblocks. Place threegrass blocksdirectly adjacent to the dirt block.
2. Under the dirt block place aminecart with a hopperconnected to adouble chest. You will need to place arailbefore you place the minecart.
3. Build a staircase to the top of the wall and lead asheepof any color into the container. After the sheep is trapped, put a glass roof onto the container.
4. Knock out one of the glass blocks that are 1 block above the dirt block and place adispenserin its place, making sure the dispenser faces the sheep. Place at least one pair of shears in the dispenser.
5. Place anobserverfacing into the dirt block. Connect it usingredstoneto the dispenser.
6. The grass blocks on the side will eventually spread to the dirt block. That dirt block will then turn into a grass block. When that grass is eaten by the sheep, the sheep will grow itswooland the observer will activate (because of the grass block changing back into a dirt block.). The observer's activation will power a dispenser that shears the sheep.
7. The wool from the sheared sheep will be sucked up by the minecart with a hopper and it will be put into the double chest.



### Getting Wools From String Dupers
4 strings can craft 1 wool. So a String duper can create many wools. But the drawbacks are less efficent to get dyed wools. And require player to craft manually.
