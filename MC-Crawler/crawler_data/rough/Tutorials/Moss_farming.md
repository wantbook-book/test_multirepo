# Tutorials/Moss farming
Moss farming refers to using bone meal to renewably obtain moss blocks , as well as azalea, flowering azalea, moss carpet, wheat seeds and grass. Many moss farms work on the principle that applying bone meal on a moss block converts some nearby blocks into moss, and generates foliage above it. The moss can either be harvested manually using a hoe or automatically by using pistons.

## Manual farming
### Using natural terrain
What you need:

- 1 moss block
- Some bone meal
- A stone(or higher tier) hoe[1]

Find a location with a lot of moss-replaceable blocks (e.g. a large cave with a lot of stone). Then, place down a moss block in a suitable location. Bone meal the moss block and harvest the moss using the hoe. Repeat the process by placing the moss in a different location.

### Manually placing blocks
What you need:

- 1 moss block
- Some bone meal
- A stone(or higher tier) hoe[1]
- Some moss-replaceable blocks(e.g. stone, deepslate)

Firstly, place your moss block in a space. Then, surround the moss block with moss-replaceable blocks, forming a 7x7 square. Bone meal the moss block and harvest the moss and foliage. Leave one moss block to repeat the process.

## Automatic moss farming
Moss blocks can be farmed automatically by applying bone meal to a moss block using a dispenser, then breaking the moss with pistons, and regenerating the stone using stone generators. You can use water to flush both the foliage and moss either into a collection system, or a couple of composters to produce bone meal. The bone meal can be resupplied to the farm to keep it running.
