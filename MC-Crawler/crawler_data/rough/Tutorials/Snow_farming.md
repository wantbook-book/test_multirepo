# Tutorials/Snow farming
Snow farms allow for quickly obtaining a large amount of snowballs, which can be further crafted into snow blocks and snow layers. The easiest way to make a snow farm is to use snow golems to produce the snow, which is what most farms use.

## Usage
There are many benefits to making a snow farm. Here is a list of some of them:

- To combine with apumpkinfarm, allowing the construction of a huge army of snow golems, which can be used to either throw snowballs at mobs, or to produce more snow.
- Snow blocks are a decent building material as long as they don't have to resist explosions; contrary to all logic, they don't melt. Thus, an easy-to-build snow farm (and a material to make lots of shovels) can avoid the need to haul many stacks of cobblestone or other material to a build site for constructing large farms.
- Hostile mobs cannot spawn on snow layers stacked 2 or more deep, if light sources aren't desired for a build.
- Endermencannot teleport onto snow layers stacked 10 or more deep.
- To use as weapons againstblazes, saving the durability of yourswordorbowfor other mobs.

## Location
The farm must be built in a biome where a snow golem can survive and generate snow. Thus, the farm cannot be built in the Nether, deserts (all variants), badlands (all variants), or savannas (except variants listed below), and it also must be built above certain altitudes in other biomes, due to temperature decrease with altitude:

- Above Y≈64 in plains, sunflower plains, swamps (including swamp hills), and beaches
- Above Y≈124 in mushroom fields and shore
- Above Y≈154 in jungles and variants
- Above Y≈184 in savanna plateau and shattered savanna plateau
- Above Y≈244 in shattered savanna

Snow farms can be built an any altitude in cold and snowy biomes, which are stone beaches, taigas, mountains, snowy taigas, and snowy tundra biomes (as well as variants).

Snow farms can be built at any level in river biomes (without the snow golem melting), which are reasonably easy to find, even in areas full of deserts, savannas, and badlands. If you are near an ocean, your farm will work on an island, even if it is next to a desert or other hot biome. 

One nice thing you can take advantage of is the fact that even if you completely drain a river, it will still stay a river biome, and therefore allow snow farms. This applies to oceans as well, but it is much easier to drain a section of a river than it is to drain up a section of an ocean.

## Piston Based Automated Snowball Farm
On Bedrock Edition snow layers can be broken by moving a block or piston head into the space occupied by snow layers, dropping snowballs. A simple fully-automated farm can therefore be made using a snow golem to create snow layers, breaking those layers using pistons and collecting the snowballs via hoppers. It is also possible to create a semi-automated snow block farm by pushing the snowballs into the player inventory, using a dropper, where they can be easily crafted into snow blocks as the farm runs.

## Manual Snowball Farm
### Materials
Before creating a snow farm, make sure that the player has all of the materials. Here is a list of the materials they will need to build a snow farm:

- Twosnow blocks
- Onecarved pumpkin
- One block that is not broken quickly with a shovel and which can havesnow layersplaced on it, such asstoneorcobblestone.
- Additional blocks to confine the golem and protect it from rain, depending on the farm location.

To operate the farm, the player will need one or more shovels and inventory space sufficient to collect a lot of snowballs. Note that snowballs only stack to 16. However, 4 snowballs can be crafted into snow blocks, which stack to 64, and yield the 4 snowballs used to craft them when mined, making a stack of snow blocks equivalent to 256 snowballs. So, if you're running out of inventory space, you can craft the snowballs into snow blocks. Later, when you are ready to use the snowballs, place the blocks on the ground and mine them.

### Build
A minimal snow farm.
For most snow farms, the player constructs a snow golem, trapped in a 1×1 space. The golem should be standing on a block that can support snow layers and isn't quickly destroyed by shovels, and where the player can easily target that block. Here is a step-by-step guide for how to make a snow farm using snow golems:

1. Place the floor block, where the golem will stand. Typically this is one level above where the player will stand, i.e. the player can and must jump to be able to stand on the block.
2. Place the two snow blocks, one on top of the other, on top of the floor block.
3. Place blocks around the upper snow block to keep the golem from leaving the farm. Full blocks will likely work better than fences, as they constrain the golem's movement to a smaller area.
4. Place the pumpkin on top of the upper snow block, which will spawn the golem in place of the snow blocks.
5. If the golem is in a position where it might be exposed torain, place a block above it to prevent this.

Here are some suggestions of ways to enhance your snow farm: 

- Includehoppersto collect snowballs and feed them into chests when the player's inventory is full
- Add aminecart with hopperunder the floor block for the same purpose
- Make a mechanism to dispense extrashovelsinto the player's hand, as existing shovels break.
- Make the area around the snow golem larger, so that more snow can be produced, and the golem won't be confined so much.

### Video tutorials
See these videos for examples of ways to make a snow farm using golems.

** Frilioth's 1.14.4 Snow Maker Tutorial **



### Operation
To operate the snow farm, simply stand next to the golem's floor block, equip a shovel, aim at the snow layer on top of that block without hitting the golem itself, and hold the dig control.

Note that the durability on the shovel will go down very quickly: a new stone shovel without the Unbreaking enchantment will break in about 13 seconds after producing 131 snowballs (enough to make 32 snow blocks with 3 snowballs leftover), and an iron shovel will break in about 25 seconds after producing 250 snowballs (enough to make 62 snow blocks with 2 snowballs left over). Unless you have an iron golem farm or plenty of iron, it is recommended to use a stone shovel, because stone shovels dig up snow at the same speed as gold, iron, and diamond, and cobblestone is extremely common and renewable. However, using stone shovels means that they have less durability, so make sure to bring plenty.

Also, remember to enable the mobGriefing gamerule; otherwise, the golem will be unable to create snow.
