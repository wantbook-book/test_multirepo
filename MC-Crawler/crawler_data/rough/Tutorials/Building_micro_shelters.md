Staircase shelter v2 inside.
11. Optional: place glass to make a window. 
12. Optional: place torches on the outside walls of the shelter to discourage hostile mob spawning at night.

### Result
Staircase shelter v2 outside.
Staircase shelter v2 inside lower area.


## Staircase-style
This is called "Staircase-style" as navigating around the house feels like going up and down like stairs.

### Materials
- 14 (13 if you have glass) solid blocks (wood is recommended)

- 1 bed
- 1 furnace
- 1-2 chest(s)

- 1 torch
- shovel (optional)
- glass or glass pane (optional)

2. Place 2 blocks across the hole at the lower layer (the lowest layer possible without breaking any other blocks, NOT the floor of the hole)
3. Place a bed above those blocks.
4. Place a crafting table and a furnace towards where you want to place the door. Make sure that the furnace is above the crafting table, for lighting in case bad things happen to the torch.
5. Add a torch above the furnace. You must sneak to do so.
6. Mine the block at the lower layer of the hole, then place a chest. Also place another chest beside it if you have two.
7. Place a top slab above the chest(s).
8. Place a bottom slab in front of the chest.
9. Place the door in front of the torch (away from the bed of course). Make sure to place from theinside.

At the bare minimum—using a hoe, dirt walls, and slabs—this will take the following raw materials:

|------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    |       | Place 2 blocks, and put a bed on top. Break the blocks, but leave the bed floating.                                                                                                                   |
| 2    |       | Dig a hole one block deep along one side of the bed. Fill the hole with water. Use the hoe on the dirt under the bed. (If the squares aren't dirt or grass, dig them out and replace them with dirt.) |
| 3    |       | Build walls, two-high around the bed, with gaps as follows: Don't block over the water yet, and also leave one space for a doorway at the head of the bed (opposite the water).                       |
| 4    |       | Place blocks over, but not inside of the water. Place only the one layer, not a full wall.                                                                                                            |
| 5    |       | Place the chests on top of the new blocks.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 6    |       | Break the two blocks above the head of the bed, and fill the space with the crafting table and furnace.                                                                                               |
| 7    |       | Place a door where the yellow block is. Make sure to place from theinside.                                                                                                                            |
| 8    |       | Place the torch on the last free block inside.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 9    |       | Put slabs across the top as the roof. Plant your seeds on the farmland inside.                                                                                                                        |

Mini shelters are slightly larger shelters that provides an extra anvil and some space, finally! You do spawn on the roof, but it is safe to jump off.

| 3    |       | Go behind the wall and dig under the wall, then fill with water to hydrate the farmland.                                      |
