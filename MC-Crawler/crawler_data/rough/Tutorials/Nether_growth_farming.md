Warped fungi can be crafted into warped fungus on a stick, which is used to control striders, and warped fungi itself is used to breed striders and are a vital part of most hoglin farms, since they scare hoglins. Crimson fungi can be used to breed hoglins. Nether sprouts and roots have no practical use, however you can compost them to get half the bonemeal you used back.
