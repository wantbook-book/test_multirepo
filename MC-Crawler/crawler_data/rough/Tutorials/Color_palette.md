## Creating a color palette
When creating a color palette, it's best to decide what blocks you mainly want to use for the build first. There are some things that require thinking, such as the contrast.
Two similar colors are next to each other,which have differences when close to it, but when further away the difference is harder to tell. This can also apply to the texture itself.

It's also helpful to look at which blocks fit together in the color palette or when put next to each other and which do not. This means that some blocks could fit in the palette and some could appear out of place which is not recommended.

A color palette consists of multiple blocks, that are usually categorized as:

- Primary color: The main block or group of blocks used for the build.
- Secondary color: other main blocks.
- Tertiary, etc...
- Decoration & Detail: additional blocks.

## Examples
### Color Palette differences
This example should show the difference a color palette can make.

House structure, with only one "color" used. Here only oak planks were used, to demonstrate a house structure with only one "color".
The next image features the same structure, but with a different frame. The top image uses Dark Oak Planks instead of oak, and the bottom one uses Birch Planks.

Darker frame
Brighter frame
In these images, the frame is clearly notable, since it contrasts with the walls. 

This time, the frame not only contains another colour, but also another texture, the oak log
The ceiling frame and the walls were swapped with stone bricks
The ceiling "walls" are still made with oak stairs.
The ceiling walls are now made of spruce stairs
