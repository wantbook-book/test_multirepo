## Nether
Bring Summer Clothes

Requirements: Enter the Nether dimension.

To get this advancement, you will need to enter the Nether. Walk into a nether portal and stand there for 4 seconds: you will appear in the Nether. This is exactly the same as We Need To Go Deeper advancement from the Minecraft tab.

## Return to Sender
Destroy a Ghast with a fireball

Requirements: Kill a ghast with a ghast fireball. Other fireballs do not work.

Ghasts spawn in three Nether biomes: soul sand valley, basalt deltas and nether wastes. When a ghast shoots a fireball at you, wait until it comes close, and then attack the fireball to send it flying back to the ghast. The reflected fireball will roughly go in the direction your crosshair is pointing in, so you can aim at the position where the ghast is about to fly to. 

To reflect the fireball without endangering yourself too much, you should face the fireball, stand slightly to the side, and start spam-clicking the attack button as the fireball comes close. The fireball can be attacked slightly outside its hitbox, so even if you fail to hit the fireball, it flies past you without dealing damage. The spam-clicking is beneficial because the time window to hit the fireball is very short, and the fireball can be reflected regardless of attack cooldown.

The above method is, however, very dangerous for unskilled players. A safer method is to shoot a projectile, such as an arrow or a snowball, at the fireball. When hit with a projectile, the fireball moves in the direction that the player is facing, and this can be used to more accurately aim the projectile at the ghast.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 50 experience, as it is a challenge advancement.

## Those Were the Days
Enter a Bastion Remnant

Requirements: Go inside a bastion remnant.

Bastion remnants are hard to miss, since they are enormous structures made of blackstone (and all of its variants). Bastion remnants spawn in every biome in the Nether except for the basalt deltas. When you enter any type of a bastion, you will be rewarded the advancement.

Note that bastions are quite dangerous places to be in: for tips on how to conquer them, see this tutorial.

## Hidden in the Depths
Obtain Ancient Debris

Requirements: Have ancient debris in your inventory.

Ancient debris can be found exclusively in the Nether. It generates as a block at levels 8 to 119, but mainly at levels 8 to 22. On average, level 16 has the most ancient debris. To mine it, you need a diamond pickaxe or better. Ancient debris can be also rarely found in chests in bastion remnants. Once you have the ancient debris in your inventory, you will be rewarded the advancement.

For a specific tutorial on how to find ancient debris, see "Tutorials/Ancient Debris".

## Subspace Bubble
Use the Nether to travel 7 km in the Overworld

Requirements: Travel at least 875 blocks horizontally from your original nether portal in the Nether, and then create and enter another nether portal in that location.

Use the Nether to travel between two points in the Overworld with a minimum horizontal distance of 7000 blocks between each other. Horizontal distances are scaled down in the Nether by a ratio of 8:1. This essentially means that for every one block you travel in the Nether, you travel eight blocks in the Overworld. This also means that you must travel at least 875 blocks in the Nether in order to travel 7000 blocks in the Overworld.

The distance is measured as Euclidean. For example, traveling from coordinates 0,0 to coordinates 600,600 in the Nether and building a nether portal to the Overworld there is not enough, but traveling from 0,0 to 700,700 is enough, as that translates to 700 * 8 * sqrt(2) blocks in the Overworld, which is roughly 7920.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 100 experience.

## A Terrible Fortress
Break your way into a Nether Fortress

Requirements: Enter a nether fortress.

Nether fortresses spawn in all Nether biomes: look for a large, dark brown structure with many rooms, hallways and pillars, made of nether bricks. Sometimes one may have to travel a long way in the Nether in order to find a fortress.

For tips on finding a nether fortress, see this part of the tutorial on defeating a nether fortress.

## 
Obtain Crying Obsidian

Requirements: Have crying obsidian in your inventory.

Crying obsidian can be obtained from bartering, from finding it as part of ruined portals, or from loot chests in bastion remnants. You will need a diamond pickaxe or better to mine it, if you found it as a block.

Once you have the crying obsidian in your inventory, you will be rewarded the advancement.

Parent of: Not Quite "Nine" Lives

## Oh Shiny
Distract Piglins with gold

Requirements: Throw a gold-related item at a piglin while not wearing golden armor.

First, get an adult piglin to become aggressive toward you while you are not wearing any golden armor. Attacking the piglin while wearing any golden armor will not trigger the advancement.

Then, throw one of the following items item at the piglin:

- Bell
- Block of Gold
- Block of Raw Gold
- Clock
- Deepslate Gold Ore
- Enchanted Golden Apple
- Gilded Blackstone
- Glistering Melon Slice
- Gold Ingot
- Gold Ore
- Golden Apple
- Golden Axe
- Golden Boots
- Golden Carrot
- Golden Chestplate
- Golden Helmet
- Golden Hoe
- Golden Horse Armor
- Golden Leggings
- Golden Pickaxe
- Golden Shovel
- Golden Sword
- Light Weighted Pressure Plate
- Nether Gold Ore
- Raw Gold

Any other items, even if they are gold-related, will not unlock this advancement.

Alternatively you can use a gold ingot on a piglin to force a trade to begin, thus granting the advancement.

Once the piglin starts admiring the item, you will be rewarded the advancement.

## This Boat Has Legs
Ride a Strider with a Warped Fungus on a Stick

Requirements: Ride and boost a strider with a warped fungus on a stick.

You need two items: a warped fungus on a stick and a saddle. A warped fungus on a stick can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients                                             | Crafting recipe |
|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Fishing Rodor<br/>DamagedFishing Rod+<br/>Warped Fungus |                 |

A saddle can be obtained in a few ways. It can be found in loot chests of dungeons, ancient cities, bastion remnants, desert pyramids, end cities, jungle pyramids, nether fortresses, strongholds and villages (weaponsmith's chest, savanna house chest or tanner's chest). You can get a saddle from fishing or from trading with master-level leatherworker villagers. Saddles also drop from mobs that are equipped with them, for example ravagers. Alternatively, you could find a strider that is pre-equipped with a saddle (see below).

Once you have those items, you have to find a strider. They can be found in the lava seas and lakes throughout the Nether. Because of this, you may have to bridge across a sea of lava to get to the strider. If you are in the endgame and have an elytra, you can fly to a body of lava and find some striders easily. Alternatively, you could attract them with warped fungus, but that works only in a short range.

Once you have a strider next to you, use the saddle on it—unless if there is baby strider on top of it, then you will have to choose a different strider. However, there is a 1 in 30 chance of a zombified piglin spawning riding a strider. This strider will have a saddle already equipped on it. If that is the case, try to kill the zombified piglin.

Afterwards, use the strider to ride it. Then, select the warped fungus on a stick. This lets you control the strider. When you use the warped fungus on a stick while riding your strider, it will boost the mount. This will use up one durability on your warped fungus on a stick. Once you have boosted the strider, you will be rewarded the advancement.

## Uneasy Alliance
Rescue a ghast from the Nether, bring it safely home to the Overworld... and then kill it

Requirements: Kill a ghast in the Overworld.

This is one of the most difficult advancements. Method described below is designed to be relatively easy to follow and reliable, at the cost of time spent, as it is definitely not the fastest.

The hardest part is getting the ghast through a nether portal. Ghasts spawn in three Nether biomes: soul sand valley, basalt deltas and nether wastes. Soul sand valley biomes are probably the best places to get a ghast, but keep in mind that the amount of skeletons might be dangerous. A better approach would be to go onto the Nether roof: see this tutorial for some methods to do so. Nether roof is a safer environment, and here it is much easier to control where mobs spawn, since by default they don't spawn on the roof at all, as they can't spawn on bedrock.

The next step is building a big nether portal: it must have at least 5×5 interior (7×7 with edges), but the bigger, the better. A maximum size nether portal is 21×21 interior (23×23 with edges). It is recommended that you choose a relatively flat area for this (again, nether roof is perfect!). Bottom edge of your portal should be at the same level as the ground, so that the ghast will not get stuck on it. If you use the roof method, you will have to build a platform around your portal, since you can't build inside bedrock. This platform should be built with fireball-proof material (e.g. cobblestone).

A method that is more time consuming, but also more reliable, involves blocking the spawning area off on all sides except that with the portal. The guard rails should be made out of bottom slabs, so the ghast won't spawn on top of the cage. Cage shown here has a 21×8 portal interior (23×10 with edges) and a 18×21 platform for spawning the ghast. Obviously, you can make it smaller or bigger, depending on how much resources and time you want to spend.

An example cage for ghast spawning
If for any reason you can't—or don't want to—go on the roof, the same cage can be built under the roof, it will just be less efficient since ghasts might spawn elsewhere instead.

After building the portal, light it up and go through yourself, to load the chunks on the other side. Check if the Overworld side has enough room for the ghast, as it can easily suffocate in walls. Making the portal on Overworld side bigger is not necessary, but might be helpful.

Go back to the nether and stand around 25-30 blocks away from the platform. Wait for the ghast to spawn. If you stand above the cage, a newly spawned ghast will not immediately target you. This process should take no more than few minutes if you built your setup on the roof, it may take quite a bit longer under the roof.

Few minutes later
Because ghasts move randomly, controlling them is very difficult, but this one should fly through the portal eventually just by chance. You can try to direct it into the portal by using fishing rods to pull the mob.

Once the ghast is in the Overworld, you will have to kill it: the easiest method for this is using a bow. Once you have successfully killed the ghast, you will be rewarded the advancement. 

Ghast went through the portal
Completing this advancement will reward the player 100 experience.

## War Pigs
Loot a chest in a Bastion Remnant

Requirements: Open a never before opened chest in a bastion remnant.

Find a chest in a bastion remnant (it must be a naturally generated chest, not a player-placed one). Then simply open it. Note that any nearby piglins that can see you will attack you when you open the chest, so to safely open it, you should either find a chest with no piglins around, or block the piglins off so they can't get to you.

Additionally, for the advancement to work, the chest must have not been opened by any player before. If you play on singleplayer, this requirement doesn't affect you. If you play on multiplayer, you need to find a bastion that was not looted by anyone.

The advancement will be rewarded as soon as you open the chest.

## 
Use a compass on a Lodestone

Requirements: Use a compass on a lodestone.

First, get a lodestone. You can either craft it or find it. Crafting a lodestone requires a netherite ingot, made from 4 netherite scraps (smelted ancient debris; see Hidden in the Depths above) and 4 gold ingots. You also need 8 chiseled stone bricks.

| Name            | Ingredients                                | Crafting recipe |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Lodestone       | Chiseled Stone Bricks+<br/>Netherite Ingot |                 |
| Netherite Ingot | Netherite Scrap+<br/>Gold Ingot            |                 |

Alternatively, you can find the lodestone. One lodestone always generates in a chest in the upper part of a "bridge" type bastion remnant.

Once you have your lodestone, you need to get a compass. It can be crafted like so:

| Ingredients                   | Crafting recipe |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| Iron Ingot+<br/>Redstone Dust |                 |

Compass can also generate in chests in ancient cities, shipwrecks, strongholds and villages (cartographer's chest). It can also be bought from librarian villagers.

Place the lodestone down and use it with the compass. The advancement is rewarded to you as soon as you do that, and the compass now points to the lodestone.

## Cover Me in Debris
Get a full suit of Netherite armor

Requirements: Have every piece of netherite armor in your inventory at the same time

You need a full set of diamond armor, four netherite ingots, a smithing table and four netherite upgrades.

Netherite ingots and diamond armor can be crafted or found in bastion remnant chests. Diamond armor can also be obtained by trading with master-level armorsmith villagers or by killing zombies and skeletons (very rare drop). It can also generate in chests in end cities and woodland mansions. 

Smithing tables can naturally generate in toolsmith houses in villages. Netherite upgrades can be found exclusively in bastion remnant chests, but guaranteed only in treasure rooms there. Alternatively, given seven diamonds and a block of netherrack, they can be duplicated in the crafting table.

| Name                                | Ingredients                                    | Crafting recipe |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Diamond Helmet                      | Diamond                                        |                 |
| Diamond Chestplate                  | Diamond                                        |                 |
| Diamond Leggings                    | Diamond                                        |                 |
| Diamond Boots                       | Diamond                                        |                 |
| Netherite Ingot                     | Netherite Scrap+<br/>Gold Ingot                |                 |
| Smithing Table                      | Iron Ingot+<br/>AnyPlanks                      |                 |
| Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template | Diamond+<br/>Netherite Upgrade+<br/>Netherrack | 2               |

Now, place down the smithing table and make a full set of netherite armor:

| Ingredients                                                                                                | Smithing recipe |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Netherite Upgrade +Diamond Boots orDiamond Helmet orDiamond Leggings orDiamond Chestplate +Netherite Ingot | Upgrade Gear    |

Once you made all of the armor and put every piece in your inventory, you will be rewarded the advancement.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 100 experience.

## Spooky Scary Skeleton
Obtain a Wither Skeleton's skull

Requirements: Have a wither skeleton skull in your inventory.

Get a wither skeleton skull. Only wither skeletons, found exclusively in nether fortresses, have a small chance of dropping one upon death, when killed by the player or by a tamed wolf. This chance is by default 2.5%, meaning that, on average, one of every 40 wither skeletons killed drops its skull. The chance can be increased if you use a sword enchanted with Looting: it increases to 3.5% chance of dropping with Looting I, to 4.5% with Looting II, and to 5.5% with Looting III. On this highest level, on average one of every 18 wither skeletons drops its skull. (For advanced players, there is a way to guarantee the drop of a skull by any wither skeleton, using a charged creeper explosion.)

Be warned that wither skeletons are very dangerous enemies, dealing high melee damage in addition to inflicting wither effect on the player. For tips on how to deal with wither skeletons and other fortress inhabitants, check out Tutorials/Defeating a Nether fortress.

Once you get the skull in your inventory, you will be rewarded the advancement.

Parent of: Withering Heights

## Into Fire
Relieve a Blaze of its rod

Requirements: Have a blaze rod in your inventory.

Acquire a blaze rod in your inventory. The only way to get it is from a blaze, another mob that spawns only in nether fortresses. Blaze by default has a 50% chance to drop a blaze rod when killed by the player or by a tamed wolf. Looting enchantment increases the amount of rods that the blaze can drop, up to 4 rods from one kill if you use a sword with Looting III.

Be warned that blazes are very dangerous enemies, dealing both melee damage and projectile damage, in addition to lighting the target on fire—which is especially deadly in the Nether, where you can't put yourself out with a water bucket! Getting at least few potions of Fire Resistance from bartering with piglins is recommended. For tips on how to deal with blazes and other fortress inhabitants, check out Tutorials/Defeating a Nether fortress.

Once you get the rod in your inventory, you will be rewarded the advancement.

## 
Charge a Respawn Anchor to the maximum

Requirements: Charge a respawn anchor with glowstone four times (to the limit).

First, craft the respawn anchor like so:

| Ingredients                    | Crafting recipe |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| Crying Obsidian+<br/>Glowstone |                 |

Additional 4 blocks of glowstone are needed to charge the anchor.

It is strongly recommended that the next part is performed in the Nether dimension. Although respawn anchors can be charged in the Overworld and the End, the moment you click on a charged respawn anchor in these dimensions, it will explode.

Place your respawn anchor and use glowstone on it four times to fully charge the respawn anchor. Once it is fully charged, you will get the advancement.

## Feels Like Home
 Take a Strider for a loooong ride on a lava lake in the Overworld

Requirements: While riding a strider, travel 50 blocks on lava in the Overworld.

First, bring a strider to the Overworld. You can get the strider to follow you into a nether portal by holding a warped fungus, or ride it into a nether portal and then dismount it. The strider will be transported to the Overworld. Make sure that:

1) chunks on the Overworld side were loaded before (similarly to the Uneasy Alliance advancement),

2) there is no water or rain on the Overworld side, as the strider takes damage from them.

After the strider is in the Overworld, you need to ride it continuously on lava until you're 50 blocks from where you started. This can either be a big enough natural lava reservoir, or a 50+ blocks long track of lava source blocks you made yourself. It is recommended that in any of these cases, you should be underground or at least in a dry biome ("Precipitation" parameter should be FALSE), because rain can kill striders very quickly, even mid-way through the ride. Also, because this advancement only accounts for horizontal displacement, going in a circle for more than 50 blocks doesn't count. If the strider walks off track, progress is reset, and you have to start from the beginning.

Once you're horizontally 50 blocks away from where you mounted the strider, you are granted the advancement.

## Hot Tourist Destinations
Explore all Nether biomes

Requirements: Find every biome in the Nether.

This is achieved by setting foot in all five biomes in the Nether: basalt deltas, crimson forest, nether wastes, soul sand valley, and warped forest.

If you go to the advancement tab, you can see a progress bar, showing how many of the five biomes you have visited. However, it does not show which of the five biomes have been visited. A way to check which biomes a player has visited is introduced in the "Adventuring Time" section, which also applies to this advancement; the only difference is that the entry to look for is minecraft:nether/explore_nether.

Once you have entered all of these biomes, you will be granted the advancement. Completing it will reward the player 500 experience.

## Withering Heights
Summon the Wither

Requirements: Be in a 101×101×104 (approximate) range from a wither when the wither explodes.

To summon the wither, place 4 blocks of soul sand or soul soil in a T shape, in any direction, and place 3 wither skeleton skulls on the line of 3 soul sand/soul soil. Two blocks under the "arms" must be air blocks.

|  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

The wither will immediately spawn, but cannot deal any damage nor be done any harm for 10 seconds, until it explodes. The explosion is very violent, so you should probably back away. At this point, as long as you're within a 100.9×100.9×103.5 area, you will get the advancement. 

It is not recommended to summon the wither without preparation. For more information on the wither, what to expect, what to prepare, and how to fight it, see the pages "Wither" and "Tutorials/Defeating the wither".

Parent of: Bring Home the Beacon

## Local Brewery
Brew a potion

Requirements: Retrieve an item from a brewing stand's potion slot.

You need a glass bottle and a brewing stand:

| Ingredients                        | Crafting recipe |
|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Blaze Rod+<br/>Anystone-tier block |                 |

Brewing stands can also be found in villages (in churches), igloos and end ships.

In the inside of a brewing stand, there are three slots on the bottom with the outline of a glass bottle, and another slot on top, which is for the actual potion ingredient. There is also a slot in the top left with the outline of blaze powder.

Brewing a potion is not actually required to complete the advancement.[1] The simplest way to complete it is to put any glass bottle (even an empty one) into any of the bottom three slots of the brewing stand interface and then remove it to get the advancement. No blaze powder or potion ingredients are needed.

## Bring Home the Beacon
Construct and place a beacon

Requirements: Be in a 20×20×14 range when a beacon is activated.

First, you need to craft the beacon, which requires a nether star, dropped by the wither upon death.

| Ingredients                          | Crafting recipe |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Glass+<br/>Nether Star+<br/>Obsidian |                 |

However, if you place a beacon by itself on the ground, it will not do anything. To activate it, you need a pyramid of certain blocks, which include blocks of iron, gold, diamond, emerald, and/or netherite. When activated, beacons can give you special powers if you are a certain number of blocks from the beacon. Minimum requirement for this advancement is a 3×3 square of mineral blocks. Place a beacon on top of the central block. This will give the beacon a power level of 1. Note that beacons require an unobstructed view of the sky (transparent blocks like glass are allowed, as well as bedrock in the nether ceiling). If you place more mineral blocks in a 5×5 square with the 3×3 square on top and a beacon on top of that, the beacon with have a power level of 2. You can continue adding bigger pyramid layers up to level 4 (see Beaconator advancement below).

To get this advancement, it doesn't matter what power level the beacon as on. As soon as the beacon is activated, it will shoot a beam of light to the sky, and you will get the advancement. Also, if you use the beacon, you can give it iron ingots, gold ingots, diamonds, emeralds, or netherite ingots to get special powers. The higher-level beacon you have, the better powers you can get.

Parent of: Beaconator

## A Furious Cocktail
Have every potion effect applied at the same time

Requirements: Have every status effect that can be obtained from a potion at the same time.

Get 13 potion effects at once. These can be obtained from brewing 12 potions:

| Effect                  | Recipe |
|-------------------------|--------|
| Fire Resistance         |        |
| Invisibility            |        |
| Jump Boost              |        |
| Night Vision            |        |
| Poison                  |        |
| Regeneration            |        |
| Slow Falling            |        |
| Slowness and Resistance |        |
| Speed                   |        |
| Strength                |        |
| Water Breathing         |        |
| Weakness                |        |

Optionally, you can extend these potions using redstone and/or turn them into splash potions using gunpowder. Then, drink/splash yourself with all potions in shortest time possible. As the Turtle Master potion has the shortest duration, you should use it last.

However, despite the name, the advancement does not track if you actually drink potions; it tracks the effects that you have. Source of these effects is irrelevant. You can, for example, use beacons for 5 out of 13 effects (Strength, Speed, Jump Boost, Resistance and Regeneration). You can also use suspicious stew, tipped arrows, golden apples etc., but note that effects from these have shorter duration and it might be tricky to apply all of them to yourself at once.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 100 experience.

Parent of: How Did We Get Here?

## Beaconator
Bring a beacon to full power

Requirements: Be in a 20×20×14 range when a beacon is activated with a pyramid of height 4 (excluding the beacon itself).

Be near a beacon when it is powered by a full-size level 4 pyramid. To acquire this, place blocks of iron, gold, diamond, emerald and/or netherite on the ground in a 9×9 square. Place another layer of mineral blocks on top of that in a 7×7 square, and another on top of that in a 5×5 square. Finally, your top layer should be 3×3, and you can place a beacon on top of this. A total of 164 mineral blocks are needed.

Once the beacon shoots its beam to the sky, you will get the advancement. Note that beacons require an unobstructed view of the sky (transparent blocks like glass are allowed, as well as bedrock in the nether ceiling).

A level 4 beacon can also give special and rare powers to the player, if opened and given a type of mineral. For more info, check out the "Beacon" page.

How to get the "Beaconator" advancement.
## 
Have every effect applied at the same time

Before attempting this advancement, you must have killed the ender dragon, so that you can reach the outer islands of the End. You also must have killed the wither, so that you have access to at least one beacon. Method described below is not the only valid one to complete How Did We Get Here, but it was designed to be as easy and safe as possible.

First, find a naturally-generated sculk shrieker (such that its can_summon property is true according to the targeted block info on the debug screen) as close as possible to an unexplored ocean monument (such that it still has at least one elder guardian). If you know your seed or are on a singleplayer world, you can use a seed map program like Chunkbase to look for a deep dark biome with a nearby ocean monument (note that, due to how the deep dark generates, it's impossible for a deep dark biome to be right under a deep ocean biome).

Dig a simple 2×2 staircase down to near the inner horizontal edge of the deep dark biome to about Y=-51 and tunnel around inside the deep dark biome to look for a cave system with a shrieker in it. Use the F3 debug screen to confirm that the shrieker's can_summon property is true, then surround the shrieker with wool (optional) and start destroying any nearby sculk sensors, followed by any sculk catalysts. If there are any other shriekers nearby besides the one you intend to use, destroy those first. If shriekers are activated three times (such that one of the "Warden draws close" sounds plays), carefully leave the area and wait at least thirty minutes for your warning level to drop back down to 0 before continuing, as a fourth shrieker activation within ten minutes after the "Warden draws close" sound will summon a warden. When done, double check that there are no more sensors nearby by making some extra noise around the area, then remove the wool surrounding the shrieker, but put a bottom slab on top of it to prevent you from accidentally stepping on it.

Then, begin building the contraption around the shrieker as shown below. (Note that you can't move or replace the shrieker, as it will remove its can_summon property). The stone bricks can be any full, solid block that blocks mob sightlines (including glass blocks), and the gold block can be any solid opaque block that can be powered by redstone. Note that all dispensers and observers are horizontal and the piston is facing up. The trapdoor in layer 2 should be covering the adjacent dispenser face, and the trapdoor in layer 1 should be covering the block under it so that the shulker minecart is raised slightly off the ground. When done, remove the bottom slab over the shrieker. The water column above the beacons should extend all the way up to sea level, and there should be no opaque blocks between the beacons and the sky (transparent blocks like water and leaves are fine). The iron blocks can be any beacon-compatible mineral block, but iron is the easiest and fastest to obtain because it can be farmed with iron golems.

Once finished, place the spectral arrows in the layer 1 dispenser and the splash potions in the layer 2 dispenser and set the beacons to Strength I+Regeneration I, Haste II, Speed II, Jump Boost II, and Resistance II. Dig a simple tunnel at least 1 block wide and at least 2 blocks tall from the top of the water column (at sea level) to the ocean and fill it with at least 1 layer of water (keeping at least 1 layer of air). Find a dolphin (remember that they can spawn in all ocean biome types except frozen and cold) and lead it back to the tunnel and down to the room with the waterlogged chests, then tie it to the fence post there and put a name tag on it to prevent it from despawning. The waterlogged chests should prevent the dolphin from drowning while also allowing it to keep contact with water to prevent it from dehydrating.

From the rails on layer 5, dig a straight staircase up and toward the world spawn until you reach the surface. At that point, go directly to the world spawn and use a compass to find the specific location of the world spawn, which is (by default) the northwest corner of a chunk. Press F3+G (or equivalent on a non-QWERTY keyboard) to show chunk borders and use a compass to find the 1×1 vertical column that the compass always points to as you walk around it. Make sure that there are no blocks over this block (including non-solid ones like flowers, grass, torches, and leaves), then surround the spot with glass and rails as shown below:

Layer 0








































Layer 1


































Layer 2























The netherrack shown above represents the world spawn, where entities show up when they come through the exit portal in the End.

Extend the rail out by 16 blocks on both ends, then begin running rails from this spot all the way to the staircase dug earlier, bridging over water if necessary. If possible, try to tunnel through hills rather than going over them, as the minecart could get stuck otherwise. It may take thousands of rails and bridging blocks to get from the world spawn to the build site, so it may be easier to simply bring a few stacks of logs and iron blocks with a crafting table to craft rails as you go. This is one of the most time-consuming parts of this advancement, but it's far more reliable than using a boat since boats can't be moved vertically up without a piston, riding a boat across water risks drowning the shulker if you move too quickly, and moving a boat across a bridge in the end risks having an enderman teleport and push the boat off the bridge and into the void. Using a minecart to carry the shulker, pushed by a furnace minecart, also allows the player to keep a healthy distance to avoid getting shot at by the shulker, and using a furnace minecart and regular rails instead of powered rails is much more resource-efficient.

Once the rails are run all the way from the world spawn to the build site, double check that there are no gaps anywhere in the rail line from the world spawn all the way up to the contraption's drop shaft. Then break the most recently used bed, make sure you're not wearing any armor with Thorns, optionally grab a shield, and head into the end to find an end city with two shulkers still at the entrance. The city should be as close to an end gateway as possible, though exact distance is less important than how much bridging you'll need to do between the two. Again, Chunkbase can be used to find a suitable candidate. Enter through the opposite side from the entrance to prevent the shulkers from seeing you and place blocks as shown below to obscure the shulkers' vision and set up the rails which will eventually be used to pick up the shulker.

The red concrete blocks mark the spaces that must contain full, solid blocks to prevent the shulker from being ejected there instead of inside the exit portal.
Once that's done, place regular rails leading all the way up and into the end gateway. Take note of the direction your rails are facing using the F3 debug screen, then go through the gateway. A trapdoor or fence gate can be used to force you into the 1-block-tall swimming position to go through without using an ender pearl each time. Depending on the type of gateway, you'll either end up at a corresponding gateway on the main island or on the obsidian platform at 100,49,0. If you arrive at the obsidian platform, just remember that any blocks on and above it will be reset to air anytime an entity enters the end, so if you exit and re-enter the end after building here (or if anyone else enters the end if you're on a server) before you get the shulker, you'll need to replace the rails. Wherever you arrive, place rails under yourself in the same direction as before and continue placing rails up to the corner of the exit portal, with an activator rail at the end, powered by a lever. The activator rail will try to eject the shulker into one of the up-to-8 adjacent air blocks at its Y level, so make sure that there are solid blocks in the spaces around the activator rail so that the only available spot is inside the exit portal.


Now head back to the end city, double-check to make sure you don't have Thorns on your armor, enter through the back like before, place a minecart on the powered rails, and crouch and use a fishing rod to hook the minecart, then get behind the glass blocks and pull the minecart. Wait for the shulker to pass by, then place a furnace minecart on the powered rails and give it some coal/charcoal and a push toward the shulker minecart. Keeping a safe distance, follow the two through the gateway, onto the main island, and up to the exit portal. You should see an empty minecart and furnace minecart and no shulker nearby. Grab both minecarts and go through the exit portal and you should see the shulker in the glass enclosure from earlier. Place the minecart and furnace minecart on the rails leading to the shulker, give the furnace minecart some coal/charcoal and a push, and the shulker will be picked up. Follow it at a safe distance all the way to the build site, but be careful to not let the shulker take damage on the way. If you suspect the shulker may not be at full health, hit it with a splash potion of regeneration. The shulker minecart should fall into the column on top of the trapdoor. Once it does, place a top slab just over the shulker to lock it in place.

Now head to the ocean monument and time how long it takes to go from the ocean monument back to the build site. If it takes longer than about two and a half minutes, you'll need to use nether portals to get from place to place. It may be helpful to build the portals on top of the nether roof to facilitate easy, safe transit. Now look for the nearest pillager outpost and village (Chunkbase can be used for this as well) and build portals to get there as well (unless you can get from the village to the pillager outpost and from the pillager outpost to the build site in under 10 minutes each). At the village, trap at least one villager in a fully-enclosed area with access to a job site, as this is all that's required to count as a "village" for the purpose of raids. At the pillager outpost, it may be helpful to fill the spawning area of the outpost (a 72×54×72 cuboid centered on the top floor) with as many grass spawning platforms as possible to maximize the chances for pillagers (and therefore pillager captains) to spawn and decrease the time it'll take after beating a raid to get Bad Omen again.

At this point, double check that the contraption is set up correctly with a nametagged dolphin tied to the fencepost, a shulker in a minecart next to the shrieker, spectral arrows in the lower dispenser, and splash potions of Fire Resistance, Invisibility, Night Vision, Slowness, Slow Falling, Water Breathing, and Weakness in the upper dispenser (behind the vertical trapdoor). Make sure you can get from the village to the pillager outpost in under 10 minutes, from the pillager outpost to the ocean monument in under 10 minutes, and from the ocean monument to the contraption in under 2.5 minutes (if not, you may need some extra swiftness potions or some other means of fast transportation through the nether portals). Also make sure that the bottom slab covering the sculk shrieker has been removed. If everything looks good, you should be ready to start the process of getting all the effects. It's recommended to make a backup of the world before continuing in case something goes wrong. It may also be helpful to record your screen so that, if something goes wrong, you can see exactly which effect(s) weren't applied.

The sequence for getting the effects is as follows:  

1. Go to the pillager outpost and kill a pillager captain to getBad Omen(1/27).
2. Optional: wait for another pillager captain to spawn. Name tag him and trap somewhere for killing it later—better to do it now than after the raid, because Bad Omen lasts much longer than Hero of the Village.
3. Go to the village (losingBad Omen(0/27)) and beat a raid (kill at least one raid mob in a raid that ends in victory) to getHero of the Village(1/27). Timer is now 40 minutes. After this point, you should make sure to only eat food if absolutely necessary. Your hunger bar must beat most15/20 by the time you reach the contraption.
4. Go back to the pillager outpost and kill the previously prepared pillager captain to getBad Omenagain (2/27). Be careful to not enter another village after that.
5. Go to the ocean monument and get cursed by an elder guardian to getMining Fatigue(3/27). Timer is now at most 5 minutes.
6. Go to the contraption. Getting within range of the beacons givesHaste,Jump Boost,Regeneration,Resistance,Speed, andStrength(9/27).
7. Eat the golden apple to getAbsorption(10/27). Timer is now at most 2 minutes.
8. Enter the contraption and close the fence gate to enter the swimming position and getConduit Power(11/27).
9. Sprint-swim (givingDolphin's Grace(12/27)) over the shrieker (which will activate and giveDarkness(13/27)) and toward the wither rose in the gap between the grindstones to getWither(14/27). The shulker will also begin firing at you, giving youLevitation(15/27). Continue sprint-swimming toward the wither rose throughout the rest of the steps.
10. Flip the lever to the right of the wither rose to trigger the dispenser behind you to shoot a spectral arrow at you (givingGlowing(19/27)) and to trigger the piston next to the lever to extend and activate an observer clock which quickly fires the potions in the upper dispenser, givingFire Resistance,Invisibility,Night Vision,Slowness,Slow Falling,Water Breathing, andWeakness(23/27). The lever can be flipped again to fire another spectral arrow if necessary.
11. Eat the pufferfish forHunger,Nausea, andPoison(26/27). Timer is now at most 15 seconds.
12. Eat the suspicious stew to getBlindness(27/27). This should grant the advancement. However, if Glowing expired before you could eat the suspicious stew, quickly flip the lever again to fire another spectral arrow and give glowing again. As long as you keep sprint-swimming at the wither rose, Wither, Levitation, Darkness, Conduit Power, Dolphin's Grace, and the six beacon effects can all be refreshed (though triggering the sculk shrieker too many times runs the risk of potentially spawning a warden).

This is a hidden advancement, meaning that it can only be viewed when the player has completed the advancement.

Completing this advancement will reward the player 1000 experience, which is the equivalent of 26 levels if the player previously had no experience. This is the most experience that a player can get by completing any advancement.
