## Ways to Break a Fall
### Block Clutch
#### Water Bucket Clutch
Main article: Water Bucket
This is one of the most well-known ways to break a fall. The player must have a water bucket in their inventory and quickly place the water just before hitting the ground. Once on the ground safely, the player can then recollect the water with the bucket to use for a future time. Note however that using a water bucket on certain full blocks like leaves and mangrove roots will waterlog them instead of placing a water source on top of them, meaning that the player would still take damage. This method also doesn't work in the Nether where water immediately evaporates.

#### Powder Snow Bucket Clutch
Main article: Powder Snow Bucket
This is the lesser known cousin of the water bucket clutch. It uses the powder snow bucket instead of a water bucket, but works in mostly the same way, placing a block of powder snow beneath a player. One key advantage is that it can be used in the Nether, while water cannot, as it evaporates. However, the powdered snow can be easily broken by any flowing liquid, done intentionally or not.

#### Cobweb Clutch
Main article: Cobweb
This technique uses cobwebs to break a fall. Cobwebs can reset fall damage[1]; however, without shears, flowing water, or a sword, they take a long time to break and will keep the player trapped for a while.

#### Block Clutch















































































Too high to use a block clutch!


This uses any solid block (excluding hay bales and beds) to break a fall by reducing the distance by one block. This must be performed after falling from a height less than twenty-five blocks higher than the surrounding terrain, or else it's practically useless.

#### Hay Bale Clutch
Main article: Hay Bale
This clutch uses hay bales to lessen the damage, but not completely nullify it.

#### Ladder Clutch
This uses ladders to break a fall. To perform this clutch, the player needs to find a block and place a ladder on one of its vertical faces, then get on the ladder, resetting their fall distance and stopping fall damage. The player must be careful not to land on the ladder's top side as they will take fall damage as normal if they do so.

#### Scaffolding Clutch
Main article: Scaffolding
Landing on scaffolding while sneaking negates any fall damage. However, scaffolding can only be placed on solid blocks with a flat top surface; it can't be placed on blocks like leaves.

| Block/Item  | Advantages                             | Disadvantages                                                                                                                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Water       | Stops fall damage                      | Doesn't work inthe Nether; putting water onleaves,mangrove rootsor similar full blockswaterlogsthem instead                          |
| Powder Snow | Stops fall damage; works in the Nether | Slightly difficult to find, due to having to findspecific biomes, or having to wait forcauldronsto fill; easily broken by any liquid |
| Cobweb      | Stops fall damage                      | It needsshears,flowing water, or aswordto break; otherwise, it will take longer                                                      |
| Block       | Dampens fall damage                    | Cannot be performed if the fall is too high                                                                                          |
| Hay Bale    | Dampens fall damage by 80%             | Hoes are the fastest way to break it, so if you're in amanhuntand the hunters are gaining on you, this isn't the best option.        |
| Ladder      | Stops fall damage                      | Quite difficult to perform; Requires the ladder to be placed on the side of a block, which can be difficult to access at times       |
| Scaffolding | Stops fall damage                      | Requires a solid block with a flat top surface to place scaffolding on; the player must be sneaking                                  |

### Elytra
If the player is wearing an elytra, they can break their fall by gliding safely to the ground.

### Slow Falling Potion
If the fall is great enough, there may be sufficient time to drink a potion of Slow Falling before hitting the ground. Similarly, the player may splash themself with a splash or lingering variant at the bottom of their fall.

### Boat Clutch
This involves placing a boat and entering it moments before the player hits the ground. If done correctly it can completely negate fall damage.

### Horse Clutch
This clutch uses a horse at the bottom of the fall and mounting it just before the player lands. If done right it can negate fall damage, however it requires the horse to be in the right position at the right time.
