# Panorama
The panorama (also known as the cubemap[1]) is a slowly panning wide-angle view of a Minecraft world displayed on the title screen. In Java Edition, it is found in the indexes directory as multiple images (panorama<0-5>.png) and are extracted in the same way as sound files, as denoted in Tutorials/Sound directory.

### 
The unreleased menu screen panorama that came before the final version.
Dinnerbone had stated that the menu panorama was originally going to be an in-game render of a live world, with custom world generation with the seed 100. He also mentioned another panorama that came before the one seen in Beta 1.8, which was a plains biome near the beach.[2]


### Classical panorama
The original menu panorama in-game. (Coordinates: X≈61.48, Y=75, Z≈-68.73)
| Java Edition(pre-Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4) | Java Edition | Bedrock Edition |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
|                                         |              |                 |

This panorama had been introduced to Java Edition in Beta 1.8's early development and used for over six years before its replacement in the 1.13 prerelease stage.

The panorama used in Java and Bedrock editions were same. When this panorama was first introduced in Bedrock Edition, it had used the version which fixed the white line inside of it.

This panorama had been taken on the seed 2151901553968352745 or 8091867987493326313 (both are considered valid seeds) at coordinates X=61.48, Y=75, Z=-68.73. This seed 2151901553968352745 spawns the player in a plains biome at -156, 244 from (Beta 1.9 Pre-release 4 to 1.12.2 and Pocket 1.0.0 to Pocket 1.1.0). The panorama distance direction is 380 blocks SW. These seeds work in versions from Alpha v1.2.0 to Beta 1.7.3 (except for population differences).[3] The actual version that was used to generate this panorama must have been a development version from Beta 1.6.6 to Beta 1.7, based on the file dates. Dinnerbone noted that the panorama was taken by Notch while he was travelling, around June 1–15, 2011.[4][5]

In Java Edition, this panorama is used for versions from Beta 1.8 Pre-release to 18w22c.

In Bedrock Edition, this panorama is used for versions from v0.7.3 alpha to 1.1.7 and had a blur applied.

In Minecraft Education, it was used from its initial release to 1.0.1. 

Usage in other editions is unknown.

This seed spawns the player in a plains Biome at 236, -212, distance direction is 1625 blocks SW in the warm ocean biome. This seed generates most correctly in version 18w22a.[7]

In Java Edition, this panorama is used for versions from 1.13-pre1 to 1.13.2. Before the panorama was changed to reflect the Village & Pillage, it was also used for versions from 18w43a to 18w47b.

This panorama used in Java and Bedrock editions are the same. When this panorama was first introduced in Bedrock Edition, it had used the version without torches.

The seed for this panorama is unknown. It was originally introduced in snapshot 21w15a, then changed in snapshot 21w18a to remove torches.[8]

In Java Edition, this panorama was introduced in 21w15a, currently used in 20w45a to 1.17.1 (includes 1.18 Experimental Snapshot 1 to 1.18 experimental snapshot 7), and once used in 21w37a to 21w40a.

### 
| Java Edition / Bedrock Edition |
|--------------------------------|
|                                |

This panorama used in Java and Bedrock editions are same.

This panorama had been taken on the seed 2151901553968352745 at coordinates X=4.83 Y=130.15 Z=-7294.28. This seed spawns the player in a windswept hills biome at 0, 0. Distance direction is 7294 blocks S in snowy taiga biome. This seed generates mostly correct on snapshot 21w40a.[9] Interestingly, this seed is exactly the same seed as the one used in the original panorama that was present in the game from Beta 1.8 until the Update Aquatic. This was an easter egg put in the game by Jappa, thought to be inspired by a tweet.[10] He later confirmed that this was indeed an homage that put emphasis on how much Minecraft had changed over the years.[11]

In Java Edition, this panorama was introduced in 21w41a, currently used in 21w37a to 1.18.2 (includes Deep Dark Experimental Snapshot 1 and 22w13oneBlockAtATime), and once used in 22w11a to 22w14a.

Ironically, despite this panorama being exclusive to Bedrock Edition, it had actually been taken in a Java Edition version before 1.18 Pre-release 5, which can be inferred from the color of water and the side texture of the dirt path.
