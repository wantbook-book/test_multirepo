# Splash
Splash texts are the yellow lines of text on the title screen. They are randomly chosen from the list below and often feature references to popular culture (e.g. websites, quotes, and video games). The splash pulsates on the title screen twice per second.

Splash texts are not translated and appear the same regardless of the language setting chosen. In Java Edition, the splashes are defined in a plain-text file within the minecraft.jar file (specifically, in version.jar/assets/minecraft/texts/splashes.txt). In Bedrock Edition, the splashes are defined in a splashes.json file.
Splashes can be modified by editing the edition's respective file via a resource pack.

## Removed splashes
Main articles: Java Edition removed features § Splashes and Bedrock Edition removed features § Splashes
When a splash is removed, the line it occupied in splashes.txt / splashes.json is deleted, meaning the line number of all subsequent splashes lowers by one.

## Notes
1. ↑This is the line number of the splash in the "splashes.txt" file; splashes are not actually numbered in any way in splashes.txt itself.
2. ↑ a b cThe exact version a splash was added is not always known. In such cases, the earliest version the splash is known to have appeared in is listed.
3. ↑This splash is intentionally a duplicate, and is part of the joke; see MC-75202.
4. ↑ a b c d e f g h i j k l m nIncluded in the replacement splashes added in 19w34a; added to splashes.txt in 1.16-rc1.
5. ↑ a b c d e f g hIncluded in the treatment pack splashes added in 1.16.0; added to splashes.txt in beta 1.16.100.58.
