# Minecraft 4k
Minecraft 4k was an edition of Minecraft developed for the 2010 Java 4K contest, where the entry games were required to be within four kibibytes (4096 bytes) in size.[1]

The initial version, released on December 2, 2009, was more limited than any other edition of Minecraft ever released to the public, including the pre-classic version that is available from the Minecraft Launcher. An update on December 4, 2009, changed the controls and added widescreen, more blocks, and the ability to place and destroy blocks.[2]

The original page hosting the game was removed in November 2014. Its archive can still be accessed using the Wayback Machine. The executable is also available on the Internet Archive.

On December 2, 2012, Notch released a JavaScript version of Minecraft 4k. It is not possible to move or look around in this version, though the camera  or world does move by itself, and there is a blue water-like block in addition to the other block types.[3]

## Gameplay
### General
The player can place and destroy blocks. The only block the player can place is grass, reminiscent of the very early builds of Minecraft internally called RubyDung that are available from the Minecraft Launcher. Leaves do not decay.

### World
The same 64×64×63 block world is generated every time the game is loaded. The only blocks in the game – air, grass block, dirt, stone, bricks, wood, and leaves – are scattered throughout the world. No mobs exist.

The initial build of the game only has one type of block, which uses a XOR fractal as a texture.

An invisible wall surrounds the world, preventing the player from escaping, similar to invisible bedrock or an old world.

### Controls
The player can move around using standard WASD controls, as well as jump using Space.

Left- and right-clicking controls are different from traditional Minecraft controls: left-click and middle-click places blocks, while right-click destroys them. Moving the mouse turns the camera "smoothly," similar to the cinematic camera in Java Edition, and cannot be changed in this version.

The camera acts differently to Minecraft's. The camera only moves when the player moves the cursor a considerably large distance away from the center of the game's viewport. Blocks in the world are selected by the cursor, rather than the center of the viewport.

The game lacks any sort of options menu or HUD.

## Graphics
The graphics appear pixelated as a result of the game rendering at a low resolution. Even when running at a higher resolution, the game does not scale the resolution properly and the noisy appearance is retained. Block textures are similar to those used in Classic, as Classic 0.30 (Creative) was the most recent version of Minecraft at the time. Most blocks appear noisier than their Minecraft counterparts, although some blocks, especially stone, are very different. The sky is black due to the lack of a skybox.

When hovering the cursor over a block, the outline of the block is thick and white, as opposed to Minecraft's thin gray selection outline.

## Blocks
The first version of the game has a single non-air block.

In the second version, block IDs are stored with four bits, resulting in 16 possible IDs. The majority of these are filled in by slightly differently textured dirt.
