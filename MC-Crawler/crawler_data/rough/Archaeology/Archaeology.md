# Archaeology
Archaeology is a gameplay mechanic that allows the player to find items that represent historical artifacts inside suspicious sand and suspicious gravel.[1][2] This mechanic was originally intended to be part of the Caves & Cliffs update, but was delayed three times until finally being released as part of the Trails & Tales update.[3]

## Guide
Players can use a brush on suspicious sand (located in warm ocean ruins, desert pyramids, and desert wells) or suspicious gravel (located in cold ocean ruins and trail ruins). Players can discover and obtain artifacts and other loot, such as sticks, emeralds and pottery sherds, which can be used to craft decorated pots. If a suspicious block falls or is broken, the loot inside is lost.

## Features
### Blocks
** Decorated Pot **
- Can be crafted with any 4 pottery sherds orbrickitems, placed in a rhombus shape.
	- The specific type of crafting material used determines which side of the resulting decorated pot shows a symbol.
		- The possible symbols are determined by the type of pottery sherd used to craft the pot.
		- Sides of the pot corresponding to bricks when crafted use a plain texture with no symbol.
- Fragile and easy to break:
	- If broken with any block-breaking tool, drops as its component materials.
	- If broken without a tool, or using a tool with theSilk Touchenchantment, drops as itself.
	- Can be broken with projectiles.
- Has a single storage slot that allows players to store up to one stack of a block or item.

**  Sniffer Egg **
- Only found from suspicious sand in warmocean ruins.

- Once two eggs are found, can be continuously obtained bybreedingsniffers withtorchflower seeds.

** Suspicious Gravel **
- Generates in cold ocean ruins andtrail ruins.
- Brushing the suspicious gravel with a brush extracts items.
- Suspicious Gravel drops as an item in Survival Mode if it stays in its Falling Block entity state for more than 30 seconds. This can be achieved by dropping the Suspicious Gravel into a two-block deep soul sand bubble column or onto two layers of cobwebs. Both actions slow down the falling Suspicious Gravel enough for its 30-second timer to expire, allowing it to drop in item form.‌[Java Edition  only]
