## Spawning
Groups of two to three goats spawn above stone variants of opaque blocks on snowy slopes, jagged peaks, and frozen peaks at the surface at a light level of 7 or higher. Goats spawn individually and more uncommonly after the world generation. 5% of all goats spawn as babies.

When a goat is spawned naturally or through breeding normal goats, it has a 2% chance of being a screaming‌[JE  only]/screamer‌[BE  only] goat. They look identical to all other goats, but they make screaming sounds and ram more often.

Adult goats have a 10% chance to be missing one of their horns upon spawning. If this chance succeeds, either the left or the right horn is removed (chosen randomly with an equal chance for each).

## Drops
### On death
Adult goats drop 1–3 when killed by a player or tamed wolf. Killing a baby goat yields no items or experience.

### Breeding
1–7 is dropped upon successful breeding.

### Goat horns

Goats drop a goat horn when they charge into a solid block. These include stone, coal ore, copper ore, iron ore, emerald ore, logs, and packed ice. In Java Edition, these blocks are listed under the snaps_goat_horn tag, and can be modified using a data pack.

There are 4 horn variants for normal goats ("Ponder", "Sing", "Seek", and "Feel"), and 4 horn variants that only screaming goats drop ("Admire", "Call", "Yearn", and "Dream"). Goats do not regrow their horns; therefore, up to two horns can be dropped per goat, or one horn if the goat spawned with only one horn.

## Behavior
When left to wander, goats tend to ascend hills and mountains rather than keep to lowlands. Their behavior is marked by jumping high and by opportunistically ramming non-moving mobs.

Goats take 10 less fall damage and avoid walking into powder snow. Goats do not get hurt by pointed dripstone if they fall on it from a minimum of six blocks, and don't die from pointed dripstone if they fall on it from a minimum of ten.

### Jumping
A goat usually jumps when trying to cross an obstacle like a small hole in the ground or powder snow. It lowers its head, then it leaps up to 10 blocks vertically and up to 5 blocks laterally. Once a goat jumps this way, it cannot do it again for 30 to 60 seconds. A goat also never voluntarily jumps more than 5 blocks down, although a goat can be pushed off a higher cliff by another mob or a piston.

Standing on a honey block prevents a goat from jumping.
