# Non-renewable resource
A non-renewable resource (as opposed to a renewable resource) is a resource that cannot be obtained in indefinite quantities in Survival without exploring more terrain or using certain glitches, commands or Creative mode to create more of them. While running out of resources other than the unique dragon egg is not likely to be a factor in normal gameplay due to massive size of a Minecraft map, in principle there is a finite quantity of these resources available in each Minecraft world.

## Obtaining
Non-renewable resources can be obtained through crafting recipes that consume other non-renewable items, found as naturally generated blocks, obtained from structure loot chests or as drops from certain enemies that do not respawn (elder guardians and piglin brutes).

Some resources are non-renewable or even unobtainable if playing on Peaceful difficulty, as monsters do not spawn.

The degree of impact the non-renewability of a resource has on normal gameplay generally depends on how limited the resource is, but on custom maps these relationships may be changed; for example, on many Skyblock-style maps, any diamonds provided are extremely valuable, as no more can be obtained.

All status effects and enchantment-item combinations that cannot be obtained in Survival are non-renewable.

## Generated structures
These non-renewable resources are found only as loot from generated structures, the blocks the structures are composed of, or as non-renewable drops from mobs which generate with the structures, and cannot be obtained in other ways unless using certain glitches, commands or Creative mode. This renders most of them unavailable in worlds with the "Generate Structures" option disabled, with the exception of the items which can be found in dungeons or desert wells, which aren't affected by the option[1][2]  . These resources are generally the most finite resources in the game, though some like cobwebs are relatively common.

### Enchantments on items without prior-work anvil penalty
While all enchantments obtainable in Survival other than Swift Sneak are renewable, for treasure enchantments the only renewable way to get them on most items is by using an anvil to combine the item with a renewable enchanted book. Using an anvil in this way causes the item to gain prior work penalty, increasing the cost of future anvil use. Similar limitations apply to some high level enchantments, which cannot be renewably obtained on items with insufficient enchantability without using an anvil.

This renders most types of items that have at least one of these enchantments without having any prior-work penalty non-renewable. Many of these item variants are unobtainable in Survival, but some of them can be found in the loot chests of various generated structures.
