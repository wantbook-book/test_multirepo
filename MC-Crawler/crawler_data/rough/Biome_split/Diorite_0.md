Diorite can generate in the Overworld in the form of ore blobs. 

In Bedrock Edition, diorite attempts to generate in two batches in all biomes in the Overworld. The first batch generate 2 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-864, from elevations 0 to 60. The second batch has 1⁄6 chance to generate blobs of size 0-864, from elevation 64 to 128. In Bedrock Edition, diorite can replace stone, andesite, granite, polished andesite, polished diorite, and polished granite. In Java Edition, diorite can replace stone, andesite, granite, tuff, and deepslate.

Diorite generates in weaponsmith houses, tannery houses, and mason houses in villages in snowy plains.

In Bedrock Edition, diorite generates in coral reefs, replacing some blocks of coral crust.
