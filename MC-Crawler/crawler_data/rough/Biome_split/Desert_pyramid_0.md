A desert pyramid or desert temple is a structure found in desert biomes and built mostly of sandstone. The desert temple contains four loot chests hidden under the floor in the center protected by a TNT trap, and a secret buried room to the side where archaeology can be performed.

## Generation
Desert pyramids generate in desert biomes. Desert pyramids have a lower generation frequency in Java Edition than in Bedrock Edition.

## Structure
Main article: /Structure
Desert pyramids are intended to represent an excavation site. The structure is constructed with normal, chiseled and cut sandstone, orange and blue terracotta, sandstone slabs and sandstone stairs.

The pattern of orange terracotta on the towers of desert pyramids is an Ankh, the ancient Egyptian symbol for life and the Nile key. There is one main entrance in the front, two more entrances in the back on both the left and right sides near the top of the pyramid, and a one-block wide window at the top. Even if the rest of the pyramid generates mostly buried by sand, the top of the pyramid is almost always above ground. A mostly buried pyramid can still be accessed by the window in the top if necessary, though fall damage is likely. In the center of the pyramid's 21×21 ground floor is a checkerboard pattern of terracotta and sandstone in a wind rose symbol, with a block of blue terracotta in the center.

Underneath this terracotta is a secret fosse containing four chests, which are rigged by a stone pressure plate directly under the blue terracotta block. The pressure plate is connected to a 3×3 grid of TNT, which means that if a player or mob unintentionally steps on the plate, it sets off the nine TNT blocks, which destroy the chests and their loot. As there is no light in the chest room, mobs sometimes spawn inside it and trigger the TNT trap, destroying the chests and loot before any player can reach it.

Desert pyramids also generate with a lower room situated in the back (either on the left or right), and buried in sand. Six to eight of these sand blocks generate as suspicious sand. This room is 5×5 blocks, has another instance of the sandstone wind rose pattern on the ground, and is connected to the main floor with collapsed stairs.

When a desert pyramid generates above a ravine, the foundation extends downward until it reaches the bottom.

### Chest loot

  

This section needs to be updated. 
Please update this section to reflect recent updates or newly available information.Reason: Need to update Module:LootChest/chests because Desert Pyramid was not changed in Java Edition 1.21

↑ a b The size of stacks (or for unstackable items, number) of this item on any given roll.

↑ a b The weight of this item relative to other items in the pool.

↑ a b The odds of finding any of this item in a single chest.

↑ a b The number of items expected per chest, averaged over a large number of chests.

↑ a b The average number of chests the player should expect to search to find any of this item.

↑ a b 'Nothing' does not refer to the chance of an empty chest.  Instead, it refers to the chance that the random loot generator does not add any loot on a single roll.

↑ a b All enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.

↑ Enchanted with a random level of Unbreaking.



The loot chances above are per chest. As each chest has a 2.6% chance to contain an enchanted golden apple for example, with four chests, each pyramid has about a 10% chance overall of having at least one.
