# Biome/Before Beta 1.8
In Java Edition Beta 1.8, Xbox 360 Edition TU5, and Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha, biomes received a major overhaul, removing and changing many biomes.

## Biome types
Pre-Beta 1.8 example of Biomes
Before the Adventure Update, biomes were much smaller, sometimes smaller than a chunk, and less distinct.

Biome generation was controlled in these versions by noise generated temperature and rainfall values, allowing for fully smooth transitions from biome to biome and preventing cold and warm biomes from generating next to one another. The specific biome was determined by where the combination of temperature and rainfall put it.

Height variation was entirely independent of biome type, with biomes having no influence on the shape of terrain. This meant things like cliffs and mountains were able to generate up to nearly 128 on the y-axis in any biome. Tall grass was also much less present in pre-1.8 worlds (except in the "Plains" and "Rainforest" biomes).

There were 13 biome types: 10 in the Overworld, 1 in the Nether, and 2 unused ones that are in the code but aren't encountered in normal play. These biomes were added in Java Edition Alpha 1.2.0, and relatively few changes were undergone to these biomes other than the introduction of birch and spruce trees in Beta 1.2 (which allowed for new chunks to have birch trees generate in forests and spruce to generate in taiga in place of oak trees), desert biome borders being rotated due to then not lining up in Beta 1.4, and the introduction of tall grass and ferns in Beta 1.6. 

Grass and foliage colors were determined by an algorithm based on the temperature and humidity, rather than from the biomes directly. This means there can be a wide range of different grass and foliage colors for any one biome. Once the game gets the temperature and humidity values by pulling grass and foliage colors, it uses said values to grab colors from /misc/grasscolor.png or /misc/foliagecolor.png, and applies it to the uncolored grass or leaves. The same implementation also existed for water colorization with /misc/watercolor.png. However, this feature wasn't enabled in the code, and wasn't implemented until Java Edition 1.13.



  

This section is missing information about range of tint colors in HEX.(Each biome tint was dependant on the temperature, and so they didn't have a specific tint color).Â 
Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page.

| Rainforest                    | Rainforests are very wet biomes with many trees, which have a 1 in 3 chance of being big, instead of 1 in 10 like all other biomes. They are similar to forests but have a large amount of tall grass and ferns (sometimes consistent and continuous cover generated) and lush green grass due to the temperature and rainfall requirements. A biome is classified as a rainforest if the temperature is greater than 97% and the rainfall is more than 90%. This could be the biome with some of the most cliffs and hills, because the world generator reduces height variation at lower rainfalls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |       |
| Seasonal Forest               | Seasonal Forests spawn with a temperature of 97% or greater, and a rainfall value between 45% and 90%. They are commonly found between forest and rainforests, and near plains biomes. They are identical to forests, except their canopies are lower density and are only capable of spawning oak trees. They have a little bit of tall grass but sometimes more is present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       |
| Forest                        | A biome with many trees and a little bit of tall grass. Wolves can spawn here. Forest is one of the only biomes where birch trees spawn. It generates when the temperature is between 50% and 97%, and the rainfall is 35% or greater. due to some forests generating in areas with 50% temperature snow can be present on hilltops but does not regenerate. the grass color can be dull green, lush green, and blueish gray depending on the temperature and rainfall values of the region. they were, and still are one of the most common biomes in the game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |       |
| Swampland                     | Identical to shrubland, with only the unused color variables and the biome name differing. A Swampland generates when the temperature is less than 70%, and the rainfall is greater than 50%. Small portions ofSnowmay generate in a swampland, due to the temperature dropping below 50%, though, it would never regenerate. Swamplands alongside the shrublands were often one of the smallest generating biomes at the time, rarely exceeding more than a few chunks in size. The swampland could often be found near the forest, shrubland, taiga, and tundra biomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |       |
| Savanna                       | A biome with mostly flat terrain and very few trees, although some hills do spawn and can host tall mountains. It seems to be one of the flattest biomes in the game, alongside desert and tundra, due to the game reducing height variation at lower rainfall values. The grass color can range from dull orange to blue-ish gray. It generates with a temperature between 50% and 95%, and a rainfall value of less than 20%. It was removed inJava Edition Beta 1.8and was re-added inJava Edition 1.7.2, although it is different from the originalSavanna.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |       |
| Shrubland                     | A biome with few trees and no tall grass. It is identical to the savanna biome, but could generate in lower temperature areas. Like the swampland, it was one of the smallest generating biomes in the game, rarely exceeding a few chunks in size, only spawning if the temperature was between 50% and 97%, and if the rainfall value is below 35%, similar conditions to a forest except with lower rainfall. It often generated near forests, seasonal forest, and savanna.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |       |
| Taiga                         | A snow biome composed of mostly mountainous terrain and a bit of tall grass. Spruce and pine trees as well asicecan be found in this region. Wolves also appear more commonly on this biome than others.SnowfallreplacesRainin taiga biomes. It generates when the temperature is between 10% and 50% and the rainfall is greater than 20%. This biome was also usually a smaller biome as compared to those fromJava Edition Beta 1.8and after. FromJava Edition Alpha 1.2toJava Edition Beta 1.1, the taiga was arguably a snowy version of the regular forest, as spruce trees were not yet added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |       |
| Desert                        | A biome consisting mostly ofSand,Sandstone,Dead BushesandCactus. Trees do not generate in deserts unless the player brings in dirt. No rain occurs in this biome. It spawns when the rainfall is less than 20% and the temperature is greater than 95%. SinceJava Edition Beta 1.0and beforeJava Edition Beta 1.4, biome borders were rotated and didn't line up because of a bug, which was more noticeable for deserts due to the fact that they generate different ground blocks than the other biomes. They mostly consist of flat plains but uncommonly hills and mountains can generate, especially if the surrounding biomes are mountainous.It was possible to find exposed or partially buried dungeons here due to sand being affected by gravity, however it is no longer the case and it is no longer possible in modern versions due to changes made to dungeon generation in 1.7.                                                                    |       |
| Plains                        | A relatively flat with a very large amount of tall grass (more than in any other type of land). The occasional trees do exist, though very rarely. Plains are typically smaller than other biomes because they have an extremely marginal generation range, only occurring if the temperature is greater than 97% and the rainfall is between 45% and 20% (less and it would be a desert, more and it would be a seasonal forest). Despite having a larger rainfall range than rainforest, the rainfall values fall into this range less often because they sometimes go outside of 0%-100% and are capped at those values, and can become "stuck" at 0% or 100% for some time. They can also sometimes but rarely be mountainous if the plains have a high rainfall (which increases the chance for varied terrain to occur) or if a mountain from a neighboring biome intersects. AfterJava Edition Beta 1.8, it becomes the second most commonbiomein the game. |       |
| Tundra                        | Snowy, barren terrain consisting of flat plains and sometimes hills and mountains, and with very few trees. The occasional trees do exist, though very rarely. Ice can be found over water, with occasional holes appearing at world generation.Snowfallreplacesrainin tundra biomes. Tundras generate when the temperature is below 50% and the rainfall is less than 20%.In Beta 1.8, Notch stated that this biome would be left out until "Beta 1.9". This is because snow was causing problems with the new biome generator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |       |
| Sky                           | A hidden biome beforeJava Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4, this biome was exclusive to, and the sole biome of theSky Dimension. It would generate floating islands with oceans of air surrounding them. Trees were uncommon, no weather occurred here, and the only mob that could spawn naturally were chickens. It had small patches of snow, although it would not accumulate again. It had green with some extra blue hue for foliage colors.This biome was introduced in Java Edition Beta 1.6 along with the Sky Dimension itself. It was reintroduced for The End's biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |       |
| Ice Desert(corner case biome) | An unused biome beforeJava Edition Beta 1.8that was in the code but never implemented into the temperature/rainfall table and thus did not actually generate. It was a biome of sand with snow on top of it and hadsnowfallandice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |       |
