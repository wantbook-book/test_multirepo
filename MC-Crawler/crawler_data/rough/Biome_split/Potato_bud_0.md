## Obtaining
### Breaking
Potato bud drops as an item when mined with any tool or by hand, but mining it with a sword is the fastest.

| Hardness | 1.5                 |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |

| Sword    | 1.5                 |

### Natural generation
Potato buds naturally generate in the corruption biome in Potato dimension.

## Usage
The block acts similarly to pointed dripstone: it grows upward like a stalactite, and if entities land on the tip, they take bonus fall damage. Potato buds can't be placed on the ceiling and they grow much faster than pointed dripstone, up to the maximum height of 25 blocks.
