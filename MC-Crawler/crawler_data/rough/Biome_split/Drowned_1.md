## Farming
Main article: Tutorials/Drowned farming
Farms that convert zombies into drowned produce all of naturally-spawned equipment dropped by zombies, as well as fishing rods, copper ingots, and (in Bedrock Edition) nautilus shells. A drowned farm must be designed to harvest naturally-spawned drowned to produce tridents in all game editions and nautilus shells in Java Edition.

## Behavior
A drowned swimming in Java Edition.
During the day, drowned stay on the floor of the body of water they are in, unless provoked.

If on land, drowned seek out nearby water. They sometimes step onto land but quickly return to the water.

They are always hostile toward axolotls. Like other zombie variants, they chase and attack villagers, wandering traders, snow golems,‌[BE  only] baby turtles and iron golems, but only at night or in dark areas.

Drowned are passive‌[JE  only] or neutral‌[BE  only] during the day if no player in range is touching the water. Drowned ignore players on land, players in boats, and players that have attacked them or other drowned. In Java Edition, a drowned is also neutral if it is equipped with a trident during the daytime, only attacking the player if provoked. During the night or in thunderstorms, they become hostile and attack any player or baby turtle they see, without provocation.

A drowned equipped with a trident continues throwing it at the player even after the player leaves the water, or gets a long distance away.[1] It also attacks any player that attacks it or another drowned. However, it is not provoked by a player killing another drowned in one hit.‌[JE  only][2] Sometimes,[more information needed] drowned do not immediately become aggressive toward a player when the player first enters the water.

** Damage from conduits **
Drowned can be damaged by a fully-powered conduit within a distance of 8 blocks.

** Abilities **
If a drowned kills a villager, either with a melee attack or with a trident, the villager has a chance of turning into a zombie villager (a 0% chance on Easy, a 50% chance on Normal, and a 100% chance on Hard).

They are immune to guardians or elder guardians attacks. They also have a small chance to be immune to knockback when damaged.[3]

Some drowned spawn with the ability to pick up loot that is on the ground. That includes armor and weapons or tools just like regular zombies. Unlike zombies however, they can also pick up tridents, which they always prefer over anything else. They also can pick it up and throw it the wrong way.

** Using tridents **
Every drowned has a melee attack, and if it spawns with a trident, the trident is used as a ranged weapon. A drowned with a trident can throw it every 1.5 seconds, sending it up to 20 blocks away. Thrown tridents cannot be picked up by the player, just like arrows shot by skeletons. In Bedrock Edition, a drowned with a trident uses a melee attack if the target is within a 3 blocks distance.

If one drowned gets attacked by another drowned's trident, the attacked drowned ignores it.

** Agression **
Drowned seek out turtle eggs within 10 blocks in Bedrock Edition and 24 blocks in Java Edition. They stomp on turtle eggs until the eggs break. Drowned can even jump over a 1-block gap to reach a turtle egg successfully, even if the egg is raised 1 block higher than the gap. 

Drowned break down wooden doors in Hard difficulty.‌[BE  only]

** Undead **
Being an undead mob, they are: 

- Damaged by the status effectInstant Healthand healed by the status effectInstant Damage.
- Unaffected by the status effectsRegenerationandPoison.
- Ignored by thewither.
- Affected by theSmiteenchantment.
- Threatening toarmadillos, causing them to hide in their shell.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80]

### Swimming
A drowned swimming in Bedrock Edition.

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition. 


Drowned use a swimming animation similar to the player. They use this animation whenever they try to pathfind to a player that is either below or above them; if the player is on the same ground level, the drowned simply walk toward them. Drowned also use this animation if they are tracking a player while they are not standing on a solid block. Their hitbox does not change when using this animation. Also, if they hold a nautilus shell or anything else in their offhand, their arms are in the same posture as a player's. When attacking, they use the player's attacking animation. Still, they use the same swimming animation when tracking a player underwater.
