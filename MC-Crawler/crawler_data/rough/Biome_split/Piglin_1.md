### Aggravation
Adult piglins are neutral if the player is wearing at least one piece of golden armor. Piglins are provoked by any player who: 

- Is not wearing any piece of gold armor.
	- Short range, light aggravation
- Attacks a piglin orpiglin brute, regardless if the player kills it in one hit or not.
	- Long range, heavy aggravation to the damaged piglin, medium aggravation to other piglins
- Opens or breaks achest,trapped chest,ender chest,[7]shulker box,[8]barrel,minecart with chest, orboat with chest.
	- Opening is short range, medium aggravation
	- Breaking is mid range, medium aggravation
- Breaks ablock of gold,gold ore,gilded blackstone,nether gold ore,block of raw gold, ordeepslate gold ore.
	- Mid range, medium aggravation

#### Aggravation range
Illustration of short range aggravation of piglins. Note the spherical range, and that piglins behind walls are not aggravated due to the line of sight being blocked.
- Short range: When a piglin has been aggravated by a player not wearing goldarmor, or opening a container, piglins from up to around 15 blocks centered around the player become aggravated by the player if there is a straight line of sight to the player.
- Mid range: When a piglin has been aggravated by a player breaking agolden blockor a container, piglins from up to 16 blocks from the playerâ€™s feet become aggravated. No line of sight is required.
- Long range: When a piglin has been aggravated by a player damaging a piglin orpiglin brute, piglins from up to 16 blocks from the damaged piglin (rather than the player) become aggravated. No line of sight is required.

#### Light aggravation
- Light aggravation occurs when a piglin has been aggravated by a player not wearing goldarmor.
- The piglin can de-aggravate when the player puts on goldarmor, distracts the piglin with gold, or the piglin loses a line of sight with the player.

#### Medium aggravation
- Medium aggravation occurs when a piglin has been aggravated by a player opening/breaking a container or breaking agolden block, or when a piglin witnesses apiglin bruteor another piglin getting damaged by a player.
- Piglins under medium aggravation can be distracted with gold.
- A piglin already under light aggravation does not re-aggravate to medium aggravation. This means that if a piglin knows a player broke agolden blocknear them after already going after them due to them not wearing goldarmor, the player can de-aggravate that piglin by putting on gold armor or losing the line of sight despite the fact that the player broke thegolden block.

#### Heavy aggravation
- Heavy aggravation occurs if a piglin is damaged.
- The piglin cannot be distracted by gold and is unable to barter while under heavy aggravation.

#### Other
- If the player is under the influence of theInvisibilityeffect, they can open containers in front of piglins without aggravating them. The player is also able to break containers or gold blocks without aggravating them while invisible.
- If the player is fully invisible (e.g. not wearing any armor) they are able to attack the piglins without them retaliating. This is not the case with any other hostile or neutral mob, because mobs attacked by an invisible player still attack the player.

Opening or breaking a hopper does not provoke the piglins.[9] Piglins do not react to the opening or breaking of other containers. Breaking a bell does not provoke them either, despite piglins admiring them as gold.[10]

### Attacking
When a piglin is attacking, it holds its dominant arm and sword in front of it, similar to a vindicator.

Adult piglins are hostile toward wither skeletons and withers. 

Adult piglins congregate within 16 blocks and attack in hordes.

When attacking with a crossbow, piglins shoot arrows every 2 seconds. In Java Edition, they walk backward (stopping if at the edge of a drop) as soon as the target is close. In Java Edition, their crossbows can break if it runs out of durability,[11] making the piglins use their fists, while in Bedrock Edition their crossbows never break.[12] Unlike mobs armed with bows, they do not strafe from left to right while shooting. Also, unlike pillagers, piglins cannot fire firework rockets or special kinds of arrows, since they cannot hold them in their off-hand if spawned so.[6] Piglins with swords and other items rush at the player.

If a group of piglins successfully defeat their target, they gather at the site of their target's demise and emit "celebration sounds". However, piglins do not have a chance of dancing unless their target was a hoglin.

When a mob attacks a piglin or piglin brute with no AI, the piglin around that no AI piglin or piglin brute do not attack the mob that attacked it.

Iron golems attack both adult and baby piglins; however, piglins do not attack iron golems without provocation.

The detection range of piglins is reduced to half of their normal range (17.5 blocks) when the player is wearing a piglin head.
