### Redstone emission
Sculk sensors emit a redstone signal when they are activated. The strength of the redstone signal is inversely proportional to the distance the vibration signal traveled – the closer the vibration is to the sculk sensor, the stronger the redstone signal is, so it reaches the maximum redstone signal strength when the vibration is directly on top of the sensor.

#### Vibration frequencies

  

This section needs expansion. 
You can help by expanding it.Instructions: Bedrock Edition values


Each vibration in the game falls under a certain frequency value. This value can be measured with a comparator. With the right contraption, the player could detect if a certain action has occurred or is occurring nearby.

#### Vibration resonance
When a sculk sensor detects a vibration, any adjacent block of amethyst will reemit a vibration on the same frequency that the sculk sensor detected.
