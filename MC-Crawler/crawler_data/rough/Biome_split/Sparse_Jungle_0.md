# Jungle
A jungle is a biome full of dense vegetation which generate in areas with high humidity values, often next to forests. There are three varieties of jungles.

## Description
Large oak trees and small or tall jungle trees generate here. Jungle trees can grow tall and are the tallest trees in the game, with the tallest of them being over 30 blocks in height. Many of the grass blocks have grass and ferns. Jungle bushes made of oak leaves‌[Java Edition  only][1] or jungle leaves‌[Bedrock Edition  only] and a single log grow on the floor of the jungle, which frequently obstruct view of the light-green grass below. Many of the leaves and logs of both types are covered in vines. Cocoa pods and melons generate on logs of small jungle trees and in patches on the ground, respectively. Melon patches are exclusive to jungle biomes, and they generate somewhat more often than pumpkin patches do in other biomes. Parrots, ocelots and pandas exclusively spawn in jungle biomes. Jungles contain varying vegetation, from the typical dense foliage of the main jungle biomes to the grassy meadows that form in sparse jungle biomes.

Jungles can border forests, plains, deserts, wooded badlands, birch forests and dark forests. Regular jungles are often separated from sparse jungles or bamboo jungles by rivers. Lush caves are common in jungle biomes due to their high humidity. They generate most in bamboo jungles, but also generate in regular jungles and sparse jungles. However, when the jungle or sparse jungle or bamboo jungle generated far inland, dripstone caves may generate under the jungle or sparse jungle or bamboo jungle instead. 

Jungle pyramids may generate in bamboo jungles‌[Java Edition  only] and regular jungles, which is exclusive to jungle biomes. As these temples are partially made of mossy cobblestone and also covered in vines, they can prove hard to spot from a distance due to the density of the trees.

Survival in jungles can be difficult. While running out of logs is unlikely, obtaining logs can present a challenge due to the heights of jungle trees. Jungle trees are significantly less sustainable compared to other trees, as their leaves drop saplings only 2.5% of the time, compared to 5% for all other trees; this means large jungle trees often drop only enough saplings to regrow them and not plant any new trees, while small jungle trees may not even drop a single sapling. The dense, foliage can easily get a player lost without some sort of trail marker, such as torches, and clearing this maze-like foliage for shelter is no easy task, due to both the heights it can reach and the sheer amount of it. However, parrots can make for useful pets when tamed; ocelots cannot be tamed, but can gain trust. They can repel creepers, while parrots can alert players of nearby monsters. Cocoa beans and melons can also be farmed for dye, food, trading and decoration.

In jungles, cod and salmon are the only fish which may be caught during fishing in Bedrock Edition. Otherwise, bamboo and cocoa beans‌[Bedrock Edition  only] can also be collected.

Jungle biomes are significantly more resource-demanding to load and render compared to other biomes. Thus, players exploring in jungles may wish to turn down their graphics settings to avoid lag and FPS drops.[2]The frequency of large jungle trees generated in Bedrock Edition is lower than in Java Edition.

## Variants
For variants that existed before 1.18, see Biome/Before 1.18.

There are three jungle biome variants: jungle, sparse jungle and bamboo jungle. There are four removed variants: jungle hills, modified jungle, modified jungle edge and bamboo jungle hills in previous versions.

The regular biome variant features the distinctive large jungle trees and dense jungle bushes across the ground. Oaks and small jungle trees along with cocoa beans also generate here. Single shoots of bamboo may generate on the floor as well. Jungle pyramids and trail ruins may generate in this biome. Ocelots, parrots and pandas may spawn here. Lush caves is common in regular jungle biomes, and generates under about 60% of regular jungle biomes. However, when the regular jungle biome generated far inland, dripstone caves may generate under this biome instead.

The following mobs are naturally spawned here：
