## Obtaining
### Breaking
When broken normally, ferns have a 12.5% chance of dropping 1 unit of wheat seeds when destroyed. This is affected by the Fortune enchantment, dropping 1-3, 1-5, or 1-7 wheat seeds respectively with Fortune I, II, and III. 

Ferns can be obtained as an item by destroying them with shears. Large ferns also drop two ferns when broken using shears.

| Block    | Fern                |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 0                   |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.05                |

### Natural generation
Ferns occur naturally only in jungle, taiga, snowy taiga and old growth taiga biomes.

### Trading
Wandering traders can sell ferns for one emerald.

### Post-generation
In Bedrock Edition, bone meal can be used on a grass block to grow ferns.

## Usage
In Bedrock Edition, sheep can eat ferns in addition to short grass and grass blocks. When a sheep eats a fern, the block is destroyed, and a sheared sheep regrows its wool. Baby sheep graze grass and ferns much more often than adults and mature 1 minute faster when grazing.

### Flower pots
Ferns can be placed in flower pots.

### Composting
Placing a fern into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

### Bone meal
Bone meal can be used on a fern to create a large fern.
