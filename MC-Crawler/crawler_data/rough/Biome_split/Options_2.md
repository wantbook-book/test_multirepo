Main article: Snooper
This option shows information on what data the game can send to Mojang, stating that it helps Mojang improve Minecraft based on info relevant to players. The "Give Feedback" button opens a link to feedback website while "Open My Data" shows the player information on telemetry data that is sent to Mojang, with the files removed after seven days. A link to the Microsoft privacy statement can be found on this page as well. A toggle for data collection is also available, though it is impossible to disable telemetry completely without client modifications.
