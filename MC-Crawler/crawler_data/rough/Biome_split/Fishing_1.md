#### Notes
1. ↑ a bThe percentages in this table are in most places rounded for clarity.
2. ↑ a bThis does not vary depending on enchantments.
3. ↑ a b cBows and fishing rods caught from the Treasure category are enchanted at a random level between 22-30, but also badly damaged. Enchantment probabilities are the same as a level-30 enchantment on an enchanting table. These can also include treasure enchantments that are unavailable via an enchanting table.
4. ↑Enchantment probabilities are the same as a level-30 enchantment on an enchanting table, but the chance of multiple enchantments is not reduced. These can also include treasure enchantments that are unavailable via an enchanting table. However, the enchantments Swift Sneak and Soul Speed can not be obtained this way.
5. ↑ a b c dFishing rods and leather boots caught from the junk category are 10%–100% damaged, and always unenchanted.
6. ↑This table presents the loot possibilities that differ from the above table for a player fishing in one of the following biomes: jungle, sparse jungle, and bamboo jungle. Items listed in the above table but not the table below remain unchanged regardless of the biome in which the player is fishing.
The percentages for Unenchanted chance and Luck of the Sea of Junk item may be inaccurate.
7. ↑In Bedrock Edition, cod and salmon are the only fish that can be caught in jungle biomes and variants.

## Fishing rod durability
See also: Fishing Rod § Usage

The fishing rod has 64 units of durability in Java Edition and 384 units in Bedrock Edition. Each use costs 1 point, and the rod breaks when all durability is consumed. The number of uses can be increased if the Unbreaking or Mending enchantments are applied. 

- Reeling in while the bobber is in the air or in the water with nothing caught on it costs no durability.
- Reeling in and successfully catching fish, junk, or treasure costs 1 durability.
- Reeling in while the bobber is stuck in a solid block costs 2 durability.
- Reeling in a dropped item costs 3 durability.
- Reeling in an entity that is not a dropped item costs 5 durability.
- A fishing rod with theMendingenchantment has effectively infinite durability from incrementally repairing itself if used for fishing only, and the player isn't wearing damaged Mending armor or holding a damaged Mending item in the offhand.

The durability cost is subtracted on reel-in, rather than on hooking. Therefore, no penalty is levied for switching to another item or dropping the rod instead of reeling in.
