## Tint
### Plants
Biome grass and foliage colors are selected from two 256×256 colormap images: grass.png and foliage.png under assets/minecraft/textures/colormap‌[JE  only] or textures/colormap‌[BE  only]. The grass.png colormap sets the colors for grass block, short grass, tall grass, ferns, large ferns, ferns in flower pots, sugar canes and stems of pink petals. Meanwhile, the foliage.png colormap sets the colors for vines and tree leaves of oak, jungle, acacia, dark oak and mangrove. Only the colors in the lower-left halfs of both images are used, even though the upper-right side of foliage.png is colored.

- grass.png
- foliage.png

The adjusted temperature and adjusted downfall values (recognized as AdjTemp and AdjDownfall in the following, respectively) are used when determining the biome color to select from the colormap. They are computed as follows:

AdjTemp = clamp( Temperature, 0.0, 1.0 )

AdjDownfall = clamp( Downfall, 0.0, 1.0 ) * AdjTemp.

"clamp" limits the range of the temperature and downfall to 0.0—1.0. The clamped downfall value is then multiplied by the adjusted temperature value, bringing its value to be inside the lower left triangle. Treating the bottom-right corner of the colormap as AdjTemp = 0.0 and AdjDownfall = 0.0, the adjusted temperature increases to 1.0 along the X-axis, and the adjusted downfall increases to 1.0 along the Y-axis.

#### Special plant tints
In the following cases, the plants are not tinted exactly according to the colormap. In Java Edition, several of them are specified in biome Jsons in vanilla data pack. 

** Swamps **
In swamps and mangrove swamps, the color for grass blocks, short and tall grass, small and large ferns, ferns in flower pots, sugar canes and the stems of pink petals is based on a noise on XZ plane. When the value of this noise is less than -0.1, it uses the color  #4c763c. Otherwise using  #6a7039. The color for vines and leaves of oaks, jungles, acacias, dark oaks and mangroves is  #6a7039 in swamps and  #8db127 in mangrove swamps, which are not affected by the colormap.

** Dark Forest **
In dark forest, the color for grass blocks, short and tall grass, small and large ferns, ferns in flower pots, sugar canes and the stems of pink petals is the result of the bitwise AND between the color in the colormap and  #fefefe, and then averaging with  #28340a. In vanilla, that is  #507a32.

** Badlands **
In badlands, wooded badlands and eroded badlands, the color for grass blocks, short and tall grass, small and large ferns, ferns in flower pots, sugar canes and the stems of pink petals is  #90814d. The color for vines and leaves of oaks, jungles, acacias, dark oaks and mangroves is  #9e814d. Both are not affected by the colormap.

** Cherry grove **
The color for plants in the cherry grove is always  #b6db61, which is not affected by the colormap.

** Other leaves **
The color for spruce leaves is  #619961 and the color for birch leaves is  #80a755. Both are not affected by the biome.
