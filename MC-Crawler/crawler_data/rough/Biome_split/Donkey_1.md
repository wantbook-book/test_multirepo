## Behavior
Donkeys roam around idly, occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass. Unlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed. A donkey may turn to look at a player who comes near. Any donkey, even a wild one, allows itself to be attached to a lead without protest. However, if the player attempts to saddle an untamed donkey, it rears and flails its front hooves. Donkeys remain passive, even when hit.

Donkeys occasionally emit an audible braying sound.

Adult donkeys cannot ride a boat; foals, however, can.

Unlike other passive mobs, donkeys slowly regenerate health.

### Taming
Adult donkeys can be tamed. In Java Edition, a player mounts a donkey by pressing use on it with an empty hand. In Bedrock Edition, the player can also hold an object that cannot be used on a donkey. A player tames an adult donkey by repeatedly mounting it until the donkey stops bucking off the player and shows hearts. It is necessary to tame a donkey in order to breed it, give it equipment, or ride it for any length of time. 

Taming depends on the donkey's "temper". They begin with a temper of 0 out of 100. When a player is riding the donkey, a random number between 0 and 99 is chosen. The donkey becomes tame if this number is less than the temper, otherwise, the temper is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off. Temper can also be increased by feeding the donkey.

While riding an untamed donkey, a galloping sound is audible, more or less rapid. This gives a general idea of the donkey's speed. It is unknown whether there is any indication of jump height before taming.

Like all tamed animals, a death message is displayed to their owner if they are killed.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

### Breeding
Feeding tamed donkeys golden apples or golden carrots activates love mode.

The offspring appear more spindly than their adult versions and grow progressively larger with time until they reach their full size. The offspring do not automatically belong to the player who owns their parents. Rather, it is born as an untamed donkey and must be tamed after it grows into an adult. The foal can be fed to make it mature faster.

Breeding two donkeys creates a donkey foal. Because all donkeys have the same texture, the offspring looks exactly like its parents when it is fully grown.

Cross-breeding a donkey with a horse creates a mule foal. Mules cannot breed.

### Food
Feeding a donkey food may alter its behavior and cause it to grow (if it is not yet an adult; foals normally take 20 minutes to fully mature if not fed), and restore its health.

In Bedrock Edition, the health of foals cannot be restored by feeding.

In Java Edition, feeding tamed donkeys in full health has no sound effect and movements.[5][6] In Bedrock Edition, while temper is at max value, untamed donkeys can be fed any food except hay bale.

To feed a donkey, hold a valid food item and press use on the donkey.

The table below lists the effects of the various foods donkeys can consume.

## Statistics
See also: Tutorials/Horses

All donkeys have three "equine stats" that vary between donkeys: health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump strength. These stats are created once the donkey is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.
