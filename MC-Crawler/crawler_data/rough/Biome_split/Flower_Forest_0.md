## Description
Flower forests are wooded with both oak and birch trees. These kinds of forests generate a wide array of flowers, along with bee nests on 2% of trees. Like almost every other Overworld biome in the game, lava lakes can generate, which can cause small forest fires due to the density of flammable wood and leaves. The same goes for fire caused by lightning strikes, although the fire caused by the strikes are usually extinguished by rain.

### Generation
Flower forests are rarer than standard forest biome and are most commonly bordered by plains biomes or separated from sunflower plains by rivers.

### Differences to regular forests
There are some key differences between regular forests and flower forests.

- Flower forests have fewer trees and lessgrass. Instead, flower forests include a diverse variety of flowers.
- The vast number of flowers makes this biome variant an excellent source ofdyes. All types of flowers can generate in flower forests,except:
	- Sunflower
	- Blue orchid
	- Torchflower
	- Pitcher plant
	- Wither rose
	- Dandelion‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
- There is a 10x chance of generating abee nest.
- Flower forests are much rarer than regular forest biomes.
- There is also a slight difference in mob spawning:
	- Wolvescannot spawn in flower forests.
	- Rabbitscan spawn in flower forests.
	- Beesalso occur 10x more often, as there is 10x higher chance of spawning abee nestwith a tree.
