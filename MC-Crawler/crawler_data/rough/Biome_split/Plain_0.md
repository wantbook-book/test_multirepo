## Description
Plains biomes are quite common and expansive, and border sunflower plains, forests, flower forests, savannas, deserts, badlands, meadows, cherry groves, snowy plains, ice spikes, and snowy slopes. 

Plains are grassy and mostly flat. Many of the grass blocks are covered in grass or tall grass. Oak trees generate sometimes; 1⁄3 are large. Rarely (1⁄20), these trees have bees and bee nests.

Some occasional large patches of plains grow various colors of tulips and these patches, along with flower forests, are the only places where tulips generate. Oxeye daisies, cornflowers, dandelions, poppys and azure bluets, flowers sporadically generate within the plains. Sunflowers are found in the sunflower variation.

Despite the calmness, survival in plains biomes can be a little hard due to the relative sparseness of the biome, though villages can serve as a temporary refuge if they are found. Oak trees sparsely generate, making wood scarce should one not want to tear down village houses or battle pillagers in outpost for wood. Additionally, the amounts of grass can prove to be a nuisance when building a shelter or combating. However, tamed horses can serve as a method of travel, allowing players to more efficiently explore their surroundings for more resources.

Plains biomes generate at temperatures of -0.450 to 0.500, meaning it generates in 3 temperature ranges, lukewarm, temperate, and cold. When it generate at the lukewarm biome temperature range, stony peaks generate instead of jagged peaks/frozen peaks. 

Horses and donkeys spawn in plains biomes. The following mobs are naturally spawned here：
