# Biome/Before TU5
In Xbox 360 Edition TU5, biomes received a major overhaul, removing and changing many biomes.

## Biome types
Before the TU5, biomes were much smaller and less distinct.

| Biome           | Characteristics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Image |

| Rainforest      | Rainforests are very wet biomes with many trees, which have a 1/3 chance of being big. They only generate oak trees, and have a large amount of tall grass, some of which is switched to ferns.  They spawn with a temperature greater than 97%, and a rainfall greater than 90% as referenced in the code. In the world generator, this could be the biome with some of the most cliffs and hills, because the noise octaves base the amount of terrain variation on rainfall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |       |
| Seasonal Forest | Seasonal Forests spawn with a temperature of 97% or greater, and a rainfall value between 45% and 90%. They are commonly found between forest and rainforests, and near plains biomes. They are identical to forests, except they have less trees and are only capable of spawning oak trees. They have a little bit of tall grass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |       |
| Forest          | A biome with many trees and a little bit of tall grass. Wolves can spawn here. Forest is the only biome where birch trees spawn. It generates when the temperature is between 50% and 97%, and the rainfall is 35% or greater.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |       |
| Swampland       | Identical to shrubland with only the unused color variables and the biome name differing. It generates when the temperature is between 10% and 70%, and the rainfall is between 50% and 90%. Because 50% temperature is snow temperature, the swamp biome can have snow (although it will not regenerate and will rain instead of snow).  Despite most of the temperature range of swamplands being below 50%, the way the rainfall is multiplied by the temperature prevents most of this, and most of the swampland does not have snow.  Because the rainfall value expected for a swampland to spawn is above 50%, it is most likely that the temperature is higher than 50% for the rainfall to be in the range required for swamplands. |       |
| Savanna         | A biome with mostly flat terrain and almost no trees, although some hills do spawn. It seems to be one of the flattest biomes in the game, alongside desert and tundra. The grass color can range from dull orange to blue-ish gray. It generates with a temperature between 50% and 95%, and a rainfall value of less than 20%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |       |
| Shrubland       | A biome with some trees and dull colored grass. Usually found at the interface between forest and savanna. No tall grass can be generated here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |       |
| Taiga           | Asnowybiome composed of mostly mountainous terrain and very few tall grass. Spruce and pine trees as well asicecan be found in this region. Wolves also appear more commonly on this biome than others. Snow is a common weather in taiga biomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |       |
| Desert          | A biome consisting mostly ofsand, dead shrubs andcacti. Trees do not generate in deserts unless the player brings in dirt. No rain occurs in this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       |
| Plains          | A very flat biome with a very large amount of tall grass (more than in any other type of land). The occasional trees do exist, though very rarely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |       |
| Tundra          | Snowy, barren terrain with very few trees. The occasional trees do exist, though very rarely. Ice can be found over water. Snow is a common weather in tundras.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |       |
