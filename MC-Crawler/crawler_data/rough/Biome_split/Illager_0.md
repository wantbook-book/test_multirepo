# Illager
An illager[1] is a type of hostile mob that regularly spawns in woodland mansions, patrols, raids, and pillager outposts. All illagers are hostile toward players, villagers (excluding baby villagers), wandering traders, snow golems‌[BE  only] and iron golems.  Illagers come in three (or four‌[JE  only]) classes: pillager, vindicator, evoker, and illusioner‌[JE  only]. In Java Edition, all of these mobs are also part of the illager entity tag.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5]

## Ravager Jockeys
A ravager jockey is an illager that spawns riding a ravager. The riders can be pillagers, vindicators, or evokers. 

** Java Edition **
A ravager ridden by a pillager spawns at raids in wave 5. Ravagers ridden by vindicators and evokers spawn at wave 7.

** Bedrock Edition **
A ravager ridden by pillager spawns at raids in waves 5 and 7. Ravagers ridden by evokers also spawn at wave 7. The ravagers ridden by vindicators do not spawn in raids, and can be spawned only with commands.

## Occurrences
Illagers spawn naturally in patrol and raids. They always spawn naturally in groups while in patrols and raids, or inside their structures.

- Pillagers spawn in pillager outposts.
- Vindicators and evokers spawn in woodland mansions.

Only pillagers, vindicators, and evokers spawn naturally.

Vindicators and evokers that spawn naturally in woodland mansions do not despawn or respawn.

Ravagers spawn exclusively in raids.

Illusioners‌[JE  only] do not spawn naturally and can only be summoned through commands.

## Raid captains
Main article: Raid captain
Illagers sometimes have their own captain. Any illager has a small chance to be a raid captain with an ominous banner (even when using a spawn egg‌[JE  only], or when summoned by commands). Raid captains can spawn in raids‌[JE  only] and one pillager raid captain will always spawn in patrols.

In Java Edition, the ominous banner equips on the illager's helmet slot. In Bedrock Edition, the illager banner equips on the illager's chestplate slot.

### Event
Main articles: Patrol and Raid
Illagers have their own in-game events, led by raid captains‌[JE  only]:

- Patrol— a naturally spawned group of five pillagers roaming the landscape and monitoring the villages.
- Raid— waves of illagers and witches spawn and attack a village with ominous horn blares. inJava Edition, An illager captain spawns in each wave with other illagers, usually with a vindicator as the captain. It is triggered when a player with theBad Omenstatus effect enters a village. Raiders and villagers usually have different behavior in a raid. InBedrock Edition, any killed raiders drops special loot. Both raiders and villagers celebrate after defeating or saving a village respectively.
