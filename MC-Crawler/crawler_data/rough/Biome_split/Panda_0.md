## Spawning
Pandas spawn rarely in groups of 1–2 in jungle biomes on grass blocks with at least a two-block space above them at a light level of 9 or more. They are slightly more common in bamboo jungles and have a 5% chance to spawn as cubs instead of adults. They do not spawn on podzol.[1]

Pandas spawn with a randomized personality, with the normal personality being the most common and the brown variant being the rarest.

## Drops
### Breeding
Upon successful breeding, 1–7 is dropped.

- 1–3, if killed by a tamedwolfor theplayer.

Like other baby animals, killing a panda cub yields no items or experience.

### Sneezing
Baby pandas have 1⁄700 chance to drop 1 slimeball after they sneeze. This means that, on average, a weak baby panda produces a slimeball every 4 hours, 51 minutes, and 40 seconds, and any other baby panda produces 1 every 58 hours and 20 minutes.

## Behavior
Pandas act similarly to other neutral mobs; they attack when hurt but only once, similar to llamas and bees. Pandas do not attack on Peaceful difficulty. Pandas follow any player that is carrying bamboo and stop following if the player moves beyond approximately 16 blocks away. They also whimper if a thunderstorm is happening in the area. Adult pandas seek out bamboo and cake to eat.

Baby pandas have a 1⁄6000 chance (0.0167%) of sneezing every game tick. Weak baby pandas are more likely to sneeze with a 1⁄500 (0.2%) chance every tick. Sneezing makes all adult pandas within 10 blocks jump and rarely drops a slimeball. Baby pandas also occasionally roll over and jump around.

Pandas have one private inventory.

Pandas can be ridden by baby zombie variants.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

A lead cannot be used on a panda by normal means.[2] However, a panda can be leashed using a map editor or NBT editor.

If a panda is being attacked by a player near a villager, that villager displays angry particles.‌[Java Edition  only] However, it does not affect the popularity of the player.

Hostile pandas are far more vicious in Java Edition.
