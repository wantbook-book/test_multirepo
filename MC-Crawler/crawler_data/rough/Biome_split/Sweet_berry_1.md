### Breeding
Sweet berries can be fed to foxes to breed them. Foxes are similar to cats when being fed as a wild animal; a sudden movement by the player may cause the fox to flee even if the player holds sweet berries. A baby fox bred by a player trusts the player and does not flee.

### Trading
Master-level butcher villagers offer to buy 10 sweet berries for an emerald.

### Entity movement
A sweet berry bush (at any stage) slows down all entities (except items) passing through it. At stage 1 and higher, it causes damage. Foxes are immune to both characteristics, however. Sweet berry bushes deal 1 damage every 0.5 seconds, only if the entity is moving in the hitbox of the bush. Entities that move through sweet berry bushes slow down to about 34.05% of their normal speed, similar to how a cobweb slows down mobs to 15% of normal speed. This makes it impossible to jump a full block while inside the bush.

Mobs at standard block height in a minecart are not damaged when the minecart is pushed through sweet berries. Players in a sweet berry bush take no damage except from horizontal movement, but are unable to jump out of the bush, similar to a cobweb.

### Bees
Bees do not pollinate sweet berry bushes.
