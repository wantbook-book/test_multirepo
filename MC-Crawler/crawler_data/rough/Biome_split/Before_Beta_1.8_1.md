| Hills/Cliffs | Mountains are hills with extreme slopes. Prior to the 1.8 update, these highly mountainous landforms were found in every biome type, with the only limiting factor being the rainfall of the biome increasing or decreasing height variation, allowing for high rainfall biomes such as rainforest their unpredictable terrain, and dry biomes like deserts and tundra to be consistently flat or mountainous. But from the Adventure Update onwards, they are very rare outside theExtreme Hills,Modified badlands,shattered savanna, andmodified junglebiomes, as mountain generation was entirely biome dependent. They were generated as part of the terrain generation algorithm from Infdev to Beta 1.7.3. The idea of biome-independent terrain was re-implemented inJava Edition 1.18.Cliffs are often carved into hills, and sometimes have caves protruding into them. These caves contain the same blocks which one would find at the same layer in the hill they are carved out of. Sometimes cliffs intersected with hills in strange ways allowing for many chaotic landscapes to generate.Some of the most famous seeds at the time were notable for the chaotic and unpredictable nature of cliffs and hills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |       |
| Ocean        | Oceans are large bodies ofwaterwith every single water tile being a spring. Prior to theAdventure Update, oceans were generated as part of the terrain generation algorithm, instead of being theirown biome. The lakebed was almost always consistently dirt, and sometimes gravel depending on if a gravel beach was nearby or not, in contrast to the clay, sand, gravel, and dirt patches from Beta 1.8 onwards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       |
| Beaches      | Beaches were usually generated next to oceans or lakes and covered all nearbylow elevatedshorelines. They could be found in any biome. They came in two varieties:sandandgravel.Sandstonewas located below sand in sand beaches, and occasional patches ofclaycould also be found.Gravel beaches had no such underground border, and thus posed dangers such as falling into caverns located right underneath them. The famous "404 challenge" was possible due to this feature.The block that beaches and ocean floors consist of is determined by the same algorithm. It is determined whether each X-Z coordinate generates with sand, dirt or gravel, and then if the highest terrain block is at altitude 65 (2 blocks above sea level) or below, the surface is replaced with that material.Like in deserts, exposed or partially buried dungeons could sometimes generate near the surface of beaches. The well known seed "worstseedever" had one in relative close proximity. However, due to changes made to the way dungeons generate in Java Edition 1.7.2, this is no longer the case in modern versions.Due to the changes in the terrain generation algorithm in the Java Edition Beta 1.8 update, beaches were removed completely from the game. They later returned with Minecraft Java Edition 1.1 as a separate biome, but lacked the spaciousness of old beaches from Beta versions, and only came in the sand variety. Java Edition 1.7 later added a beach biome that is made of stone and gravel, the stone shore, for when a beach generates next to an extreme hills biome. Spacier beaches were re-added in Java Edition 1.18. |       |
