## Spawning
In Java Edition, 1-3 donkeys spawn in plains and only 1 in savannas. Donkeys also spawn in meadows. 20% of all individual donkeys naturally spawn as foals. All of individual donkeys spawn as adults when using spawn eggs.[1]

In Bedrock Edition, 2-6 donkeys spawn only in plains at light level 7 or above.[2]

## Appearance
Adult donkeys are 1.4 blocks wide and long, and 1.6 blocks high. Foals start at half the size of adults and in Bedrock Edition, get progressively bigger as they age. Unlike wolves and cats, the appearances of donkeys do not change once they have been tamed, though tamed donkeys may be differentiated by giving them equipment.

Donkeys are smaller all around than the normal horses and sport long, erect ears. Their manes do not protrude, but rather are drawn directly on the back of their heads and necks. All donkeys have gray-brown coats with darker ankles, ears, manes, and tails. Donkeys can be equipped with a simple saddle, not the full covered armor and they can also be equipped with chests to store up to 15 stacks of items.

Unlike almost all other mobs, donkeys with equipped saddles or chests do not render these when under the effect of Invisibility.[3]

## Drops

1–7 experience orbs upon a successful breeding.

- 1–3, when killed by a player ortamed wolf.
- If equipped with achestorsaddle, they drop those items. They also drop the contents of the chest.

Killing a baby donkey yields no items nor experience.

## Usage
See also: Transportation

Tamed and saddled donkeys are some of the fastest means of transportation or hauling in the game, although they are unable to fit through single block-wide openings. They can also be used to climb hills and jump fences, which the player can't generally.

Donkeys cannot float on water when being controlled by a player. They can be ridden in water up to 2 blocks deep. In deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.[4]

Donkeys can be equipped with chests and used as pack animals. They can also be pulled along and tied up using a lead.

### Equipment
GUI of a donkey, when equipped with a chest.
Tamed donkeys can have the following slots available:

- Saddle Slot: For equipping asaddle.
- An additional 15 inventory slots,providedthe donkey has been equipped with achest.

Equipment can be placed on a donkey by holding left shift and then using on the donkey, or by accessing its inventory. A donkey’s inventory can be accessed by mounting the donkey and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using or pressing the "open inventory" button‌[Bedrock Edition  only] on the donkey.

A donkey can be equipped with a chest by using a chest on a donkey. The chest cannot be removed except by killing the donkey, which causes the chest and its contents to drop.

Foals cannot be equipped with anything.

### Riding
Main article: Riding
Once a donkey is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with the standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse. The player dismounts using the dismount control. Like riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a donkey.

A ridden saddled donkey automatically runs up any one block high slope. The donkey and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high. Lower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block. The donkey itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks. They cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.

Unlike horses, all spawned donkeys have the same movement speed and jump strength, although speed potions can be used on the donkey and travel via the Nether can make the donkey easily the pack animal with the fastest practical way to travel in Minecraft. Donkeys are slow-moving backward, and about as fast as the player when moving sideways.

Ridden saddled donkeys have the ability of "jumping charging". In Java Edition, when the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar, and hunger bar is replaced by donkey's health bar; in Bedrock Edition, both health bar and hunger can display, and only when jump charging, the experience bar is replaced by jumping charging bar, but the number over the experience bar is still visible. A ridden saddled donkey can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap. Donkeys are not affected by Jump Boost beacons.
