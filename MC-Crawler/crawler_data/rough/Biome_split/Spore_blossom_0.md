## Obtaining
### Breaking
Spore blossoms can be broken instantly with any item or by hand. Harvesting a spore blossom with shears consumes the durability of the shears for no additional benefit.

| Block    | Spore Blossom       |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 0                   |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.05                |

### Natural generation
Spore blossoms can be found only on the ceiling of lush caves.


## Usage
Spore blossoms can be placed only on the underside of any block except leaves.

They emit two kinds of particles: one falling straight downwards, disappearing after a certain distance; the other spreading to a large area, up to 22 blocks, floating around in the air, spreading further away as they slowly fall down.

Spore blossoms can be pollinated by bees.

### Bee nests
Oak, birch, and cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of a spore blossom have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest and 1-3 bees in it.

### Composting
Spore blossoms can be put into a composter with a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
