## Generation
Jungle pyramids/temples can generate in jungles and bamboo jungles‌[Java Edition  only], but not sparse jungles.[1]

## Structure
Main article: /Structure
Jungle pyramids/temples consist of cobblestone, mossy cobblestone and vines. There are 3 floors. 

It is possible to find blocks that normally generate outside the pyramid/temple (like leaves) appearing inside, possibly blocking the chests or dispensers, or interrupting the redstone.

### Puzzle
Main article: Tutorials/Defeating temples § Jungle pyramid
On the bottom floor, there is a puzzle consisting of 3 levers on 3 chiseled stone bricks connected to a hidden piston trapdoor mechanism. If the combination is entered correctly, a block on the main floor is pulled away, revealing a chest.

### Trap
Down the hall from the puzzle, there is another chest. There are two tripwire lines connected to dispensers with 2–14 arrows, hidden behind vines. The first tripwire is in the middle of the hallway and the second tripwire is around the corner in front of the chest. Walking over the tripwire triggers the dispenser attached to it. Breaking the tripwire with anything other than shears also triggers it.

### Chests

  

This section needs to be updated. 
Please update this section to reflect recent updates or newly available information.Reason: Need to update Module:LootChest/chests because Jungle Pyramid was not changed in Java Edition 1.21


In Java Edition, each jungle pyramid chest contains  items drawn from 2 pools,  with the following distribution:

↑ a b c The size of stacks (or for unstackable items, number) of this item on any given roll.

↑ a b c The weight of this item relative to other items in the pool.

↑ a b c The odds of finding any of this item in a single chest.

↑ a b c The number of items expected per chest, averaged over a large number of chests.

↑ a b c The average number of chests the player should expect to search to find any of this item.

↑ a b c 'Nothing' does not refer to the chance of an empty chest.  Instead, it refers to the chance that the random loot generator does not add any loot on a single roll.

↑ a b c Enchantment probabilities are the same as a level-30 enchantment on an enchantment table that was able to apply treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and where the chance of multiple enchantments is not reduced.

↑ Enchanted with a random level of Unbreaking.
