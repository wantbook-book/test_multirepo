# Color
Colors are applied to several blocks, items and particles in order to display a much wider array of possibilities than would be possible with a raw unmodified texture without the need for potentially millions of distinct files.

## Block and fluid colors
Main article: Block colors
### Grass
For the colors applied to these blocks in Java Edition, see Block colors § Grass colors.

For the colors applied to these blocks in Bedrock Edition, see Block colors § Grass colors 2.

The following blocks are counted as part of the "grass" group of blocks as of 1.19.3, and are accordingly colored:

- Grass Block
- Short Grass
- Tall Grass
- Fern
- Large Fern
- Potted Fern
- Sugar Cane

Grass colors are biome-dependent, and the colors used are usually picked from a dedicated grass colormap, with some exceptions.

The following removed blocks (many unintended) also utilized the grass colors (full lists of renders can be found here and here):

- Green Shrub
- Potted Green Shrub

### Foliage
For the colors applied to these blocks in Java Edition, see Block colors § Foliage colors.

For the colors applied to these blocks in Bedrock Edition, see Block colors § Foliage colors 2.

The following blocks are counted as part of the "foliage" group of blocks as of 1.19.3, and are accordingly colored:

- Oak Leaves
- Jungle Leaves
- Acacia Leaves
- Dark Oak Leaves
- Vines

Foliage colors are biome-dependent, and the colors used are usually picked from a dedicated foliage colormap, with some exceptions.

The following removed blocks (many unintended) also utilized the grass colors (a full list of renders can be found here):

### Water
For the colors applied to water in Java Edition, see Block colors § Water colors.

For the colors applied to water in Bedrock Edition, see Block colors § Water colors 2.

Water placed in the world is also subject to coloring. In Java Edition, this also applies to cauldrons.

- Water
- Water Cauldron

Unlike grass and foliage, water colors are always predefined, and are never picked from a colormap, even though one used to exist.

### Stems
For the colors applied to stems, see Block colors § Stem colors.

Unlike other crops, pumpkin stems and melon stems utilize a color system which applies a different color for each growth stage.

- Pumpkin Seeds
- Melon Seeds

### Redstone wire
For the colors applied to redstone wire, see Block colors § Redstone colors.

Redstone wire uses a color system which colors the wire depending on its current power level. With no power, it appears as a very dark red, whereas it appears bright red at full power.

- Redstone Wire

### Potion cauldrons
Main article: Effect colors
Potions placed in cauldrons also use colors to represent the contained potion.[more information needed]

### Constant colors
For a list of constant colors, see Block colors § Constant colors.

A small subclass of blocks use colors which do not change at all under any circumstances. Why this is done is unknown, as a colored texture with no color would achieve the exact same visual outcome and allow for further customizability with resource packs.

- Birch Leaves:#80A755
- Spruce Leaves:#619961
- Mangrove Leaves
- Lily Pad:#208030
- Attached Melon Stem:#E0C71C
- Attached Pumpkin Stem:#E0C71C
