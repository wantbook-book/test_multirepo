## Features
Main article: Minecraft Education exclusive features
Minecraft Education is based on Bedrock Edition[11] and contains features that make Minecraft more accessible and effective in a classroom setting, including:

- Easy classroom collaboration: Educators have told us that one of the greatest benefits ofMinecraft Educationis the ability for students to collaborate to build projects and solve problems. An entire classroom of up to 40 students can play in a world together with no separate server setup required. Students can also work together in pairs or groups simply by joining their classmates' world.
- Non-player characters: An educator may create anNPCto act as a guide for students in the game, giving instruction, providing more information, and also allowing educators to insert an active web link to additional references.
- Camera+Portfolio: An important aspect of teaching withMinecraftis being able to collect evidence of learning in the game, and being able to track student progression. The camera and portfolio features allow students to take screenshots of their work and document the development of their projects.
- Chalkboards: Creators can use chalkboards to communicate learning goals, provide additional information and give explicit instructions within the game. Chalkboards come in three different sizes –(1×1),(2×1), and(2×3).
- Tutorial world: For educators or students new toMinecraft, a tutorial world is available that guides players on in-game navigation, crafting, and placing or breaking blocks.
- AllowandDenyblocks: These blocks allow the educator (or a player with World Builder privileges) to place specific areas where players can or cannot build.
- Borderblocks: These blocks prevent players from entering or leaving a specific area. The range of influence extends the full range of the Y coordinate from wherever the block is placed on the X & Z coordinates. It is the same shape as a cobblestone wall but with a smooth, red texture and red particle effects. Note: These blocks can be bypassed using ender pearls or chorus fruit.
- Classroom mode: This is a complimentary program toMinecraft Educationand allows educators a master view of the map (including the locations of all players), communicate with players via chat (and monitor the chat), and turn off/on some world settings.
- Additional item hotbar: There is a smaller hotbar with three additional slots that can be enabled for players by the educator. This smaller hotbar rests to the right-side of the main hotbar and educators can populate this hotbar with items.
- Code builder and theAgent: A complimentary program toMinecraft Educationthat allows students to write code in a code editor and the Agent then executes the code in the program. This was a newly announced feature and was implemented in 1.0.1.
- New/abilitycommand allows the player to modify permissions of players such as theWorld Builderpermission,MayFlyallows the player to enable/disable fly in all game modes, andmuteallows the player to mute another player. Abilities are similar to gamerules, except they apply to a player rather than the entire world.
- A newImmutable Worldgamerule, if true it prevents any players who are not teachers (or who don't have World Builder permissions) from breaking or placing any blocks unless they are on top of anAllowblock.
- World Builder is an ability that can be applied to a player to allow bypassing the functions ofBorderblocks andDenyblocks.

## Lesson plans
Lesson plans through Minecraft Education are available to download and are split between certain age groups and various subjects such as history, visual arts, and gaming. Additionally, educators can upload lesson plans that they have created for others to use from the main website.

## Pricing
