### Natural generation
Gravtater covers most of the the surface of the hash biome.

## Usage
Gravtater can replace sand in most uses. 

It is affected by gravity, and if the block generates floating, it produces falling dust particles. Cactuses and bamboo can grow on gravtater, and sugar cane can grow too, if the block is adjacent to water. Turtles can lay their eggs on gravtater. Sculk catalysts can replace gravtater with sculk blocks.

Unlike sand, however, this block supports growth of potatoes, similarly to farmland.
