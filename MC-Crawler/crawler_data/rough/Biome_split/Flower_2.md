### Suspicious stew
Main article: Suspicious Stew
All small flowers can be used to create suspicious stew. When a flower is used on a brown mooshroom, the brown mooshroom produces a suspicious stew related to that flower the next time it is milked with a bowl. The mooshroom returns to producing regular mushroom stew until fed another flower. Eating one bowl of suspicious stew restores 6 () hunger and 7.2 hunger saturation, as well as producing a brief status effect.

Using different flowers results in different effects. All are short-lived, but some have lasting effects: The regeneration restores 2 or 3 health; Wither or poison inflicts up to 2 hearts damage. The saturation effectively makes those stews a superfood: they restore up to 6 hunger and 12 saturation points on top of their food value, for a total of 12 ( Ã— 6) and over 19 points of saturation.

### Bees
Bees engage in a pollinating behavior with flowers, increasing the honey level in beehives and bee nests by 1. Bees attempt to pollinate wither roses, although they get damaged in the process.[2] In Bedrock Edition, bees ignore snowlogged flowers.[3]

### Breeding
Any flower can be used for bees, including wither roses.[4]

### Bee nests
Oak, birch, and cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of any flower have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest and 1-3 bees in it.

### Composting
Placing any flower (except for the torchflower or a pitcher plant) into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of flowers yields an average of 5.94 bone meal.

Placing a torchflower or a pitcher plant into a composter has a 85% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
