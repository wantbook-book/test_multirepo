Seeds are values made up of character(s) (including negative or positive integers) that are used as the basis for generating every Minecraft world.[1]

## Compatibility
Seeds are somewhat compatible across editions, with terrain generation and biomes being the same. However, the placement of generated structures differs between Java Edition and Bedrock Edition.

## World generation
Main article: World generation
Whenever the game has to generate a new world, it calls upon an algorithm known as Perlin noise. This algorithm outputs a pseudo-random value that is then used to determine the characteristics and features of the world. However, the algorithm always outputs the same value each time for a constant starting point (seed). Thus, the same seed generates the same terrain every time.

A world's seed is set when that world is created. By default, it is decided automatically, but it can also be set manually. Setting and reusing a seed from one world generates the same world. Either a number or a word/phrase can be used, including negatives. If a word/phrase is used, it is converted into a 32-bit integer.

Whenever the world generation algorithm is updated (usually by adding new biomes to the game), the same seed no longer generates the same terrain. If the seed or generator changes in a saved world, new chunks are based on the new seed and no longer match those from the old seed. Deleted chunks can regenerate if the seed and generator remain the same, but changes if either the seed or generator changes. In fact, deleting chunks is sometimes done to let newly-introduced features appear in an old world; see Tutorials/Updating old oceans in 1.13 using MCEdit.

Because seeds are simply random values read into an algorithm and not actually names of different worlds, using a certain seed does not result in a world with any relevance to the value of that seed. For instance, using a biome name as the seed does not necessarily result in the creation of a world with primarily that biome, nor does it spawn the player within the said biome.

## Determining the seed
In Java Edition, the player can enter the command /seed to view the world's seed. This command is available in singleplayer worlds even if cheats are off. The player can also select 'Re-create' in the Worlds menu to see the seed.

In Bedrock Edition, the seed can be found on the world options screen. There are also seed templates that offers the player several pre-set seeds to generate worlds with specific features near the spawn point. Additionally, the beta version has a visible seed on the top of the screen.
