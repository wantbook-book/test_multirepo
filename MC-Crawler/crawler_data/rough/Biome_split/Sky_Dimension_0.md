## Mod-enabled version
Code for a prototype of the Sky Dimension exists in Java Edition Beta 1.6, Java Edition Beta 1.7 and Java Edition Beta 1.8. Essentially, the only thing preventing it from being fully functional is the absence of a means of generating it and getting there. Using various mods, it is possible to access this currently unfinished version of the Sky Dimension.

The Sky Dimension can be accessed by modifying wr.class in beta 1.6.6, xa.class in beta 1.7.3, and acz.class in beta 1.8.1.

In this version of the Sky Dimension, the buildup of the world blocks-wise is very much like the Overworld, but it is always midday and it does not rain or snow (though cloud cover does appear as if it were raining). Like in the Overworld, there are oak trees, flowers, springs, lakes, and caves, and you can also find pumpkins, mushrooms, dungeons, iron, coal, and gold. Although uncommon, it is also possible to find sugar cane, redstone, lapis lazuli, and more rarely diamond. The only mobs that spawn in the sky dimension are chickens; no other mobs (including hostile ones and squid) spawn, except for monsters spawned by spawners in dungeons. Snow generates on surfaces above a certain altitude, similarly to mountain biomes, however, there is no weather in the Sky Dimension, so this snow is not renewable. Below the islands of the Sky Dimension is nothing but the Void and a layer of clouds.

## Bugs
A world corruption on singleplayer.
Originally, the Sky Dimension was hidden within the region 0 (Overworld) code. However, starting in Beta 1.9 Pre-release 3, it was given its own region: Region 2, with Region 1 being the Nether. However, Sky Dimension chunks stopped spawning within its region, they would generate in the Overworld on Multiplayer servers. If a world with Sky Dimension chunks is brought from multiplayer to singleplayer, the area of the chunks are always Plains biome, even if snow generated naturally on the ground.
