## Description
Windswept hills generate in areas with high erosion, high PV and high continentalness, which means that the terrain is usually flat, but sometimes hilly and shattered. The cliffs of the windswept hills generally and peaks at roughly Y-level 140. Above Y=120±8, rainfall changes to snowfall, and the hills becomes snow-capped, along with water freezing into ice. Despite windswept hill biomes being highland biomes, deep dark doesn't generate under windswept hills biomes. 

The grass and leaves are an aqua color. These are the only biomes, besides mountain biomes, where emerald ore is found. Like mountains, infested blocks with silverfish can be generated underground below the sea level. Oak trees and spruce trees occasionally generate here, with a bit of grass, poppies‌[Java Edition  only] and dandelions on the ground. Llamas can spawn in these biomes.

Survival in windswept hills can be challenging to beginners, due to the heights often risking heavy fall damage and higher elevations bringing snow and ice, but can be fairly easy once the player has acclimated to the area and found or made a flat-enough space for shelter. Llamas can also serve as useful pack animals when tamed. Water must be protected by light or a roof to prevent it from freezing when above the snowfall line, however, and the player must be aware of their surroundings to avoid falling off steep cliffs, especially when fighting hostile mobs. Care should also be taken when mining in windswept hills, due to infested stone occasionally generating; the player might get swarmed with silverfish if they're not prepared.

The following mobs are naturally spawned here：
