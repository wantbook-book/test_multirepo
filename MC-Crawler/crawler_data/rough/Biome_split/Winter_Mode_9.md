### 
The "Super Secret Settings", added in snapshot 13w38a for 1.7.2, were removed in snapshot 15w31a for 1.9 due to an internal rewrite. It was a button under the options menu that, when pressed, would blare a random game sound with a lower pitch, and activate a shader.

### Native Twitch.tv integration
Native Twitch.tv integration was added in snapshot 13w47a for 1.7.4, and was removed in snapshot 15w31a for 1.9. It integrated Twitch chat into the game.

### entity.hanging.place and entity.hanging.pop
entity.hanging.place and entity.hanging.pop were two sound effects added in snapshot 15w49a and removed in the next snapshot, 15w49b. The sound effects were blank audio files and were likely intended as sound effects for the lead.

### Old conduit particle
Main article: Conduit § History
           

The conduit was added in snapshot 18w15a with particles, but those particles were changed in the next snapshot, 18w16a.


### 
Main article: Commands
There was a locate command called /locate New_Village. This was implemented in snapshot 18w48a for Village & Pillage before the village structures from Update Aquatic and prior were removed. Once these "old" villages were officially taken from the game's structure spawn list in snapshot 19w02a, /locate New_Village was replaced by /locate Village as the New_Village ID was no longer needed.

### First-person view pivot

Removed in 1.14 for performance reasons. Before changed, the player could not look directly upwards or downwards.

### Placeholder block drops
Main article: Survival Test
Survival Test introduced block drops, which were mapped as follows:

| Block    | Historical drops | Current drops |
|----------|------------------|---------------|
| Gold Ore | Block of Gold    | Raw Gold      |
| Iron Ore | Block of Iron    | Raw Iron      |
| Coal Ore | Stone Slab       | Coal          |
| Wood     | Planks           | (itself)      |

Block drops were reworked in Indev.

### Minimized textures
Main article: Survival Test
In Survival Test, item drops were restricted to the cube shape used for blocks. The projected texture was the same on all faces and the texture scale was closer to those of blocks, making it look cropped.

### Tags
Main article: Tag § History
The water_hacked and waterlogged tags were added in snapshots 18w07a and 18w07b for 1.13 respectively and removed in 18w10c. Before the removal, these tags functioned as follows:

| Tag                    | Values                                                                                                                              | Usage                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| minecraft:waterlogged  | #minecraft:coral_plants, minecraft:bubble_column, minecraft:kelp, minecraft:kelp_top, minecraft:sea_grass, minecraft:tall_sea_grass | Used in the water_hacked.json block tag file. Prevents non-water mobs from spawning in this block. Allows swimming in this block.<br/> |

### Java launcher easter eggs
Prior to the release of Launcher 2.1.497x, the launcher contained multiple easter eggs. If the player hovered their cursor over the "Play" button for a few seconds, a random mob would appear in the bottom right corner of the launcher. In the top left corner of the launcher, the player could see a translucent creeper face. There was about a 1⁄11 chance of the creeper face being replaced with a shrugging kaomoji, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. When the player clicked on either of these, they turned solid white. Clicking them again would return them to their translucent state. In addition, if the player pressed Ctrl+B, the experience orb pickup sound would play ().

### Old walking animation for mobs
In Survival Test, mobs (pigs, sheep, skeletons, zombies, spiders and creepers) had different walking animations.

### Creeper melee attack
In Survival Test, creepers did melee damage (4) to the player. In Indev 0.31, this feature was removed.

### Removed with the 1.3 server split
Main article: Java Edition 12w18a/List of broken features
When 1.3 split client and server logic, several features lost significant functionality. While some of these have been effectively restored or at least substituted, many of them remain moved to this day.
