The formulas for figuring out how many experience orbs needed to get to the next level are as follows:

Experience required =2 × current_level + 7 (for levels 0–15)
5 × current_level – 38 (for levels 16–30)
9 × current_level – 158 (for levels 31+)
One can determine how much experience has been collected to reach a level using the equations:

Total experience =level2 + 6 × level (at levels 0–16)
2.5 × level2 – 40.5 × level + 360 (at levels 17–31)
4.5 × level2 – 162.5 × level + 2220 (at levels 32+)
Likewise, to get the number of levels from the total experience value, one can utilize the following inverse equations:

Total Levels =At levels 0-16 (totals 0 to 352): total+9−3
At levels 17–31 (totals 353 to 1507): 8110+25(total−783940)
At levels 32+ (totals 1508+): 32518+29(total−5421572)
### Useful numbers
- To get from level 0 to level 30 requires 1395 experience.
- To get from level 27 to level 30 requires 306 experience.
- Killing one largeslimeand all the slimes that split from it yield from 12 to 28 experience, with an average of 19.
- Killing a slime of the largest size that can be spawned using the/summoncommand and all slimes that split from it yield 448 to 8128 experience, with an average of 3025.
- The maximum level required for enchanting is level 30, while the anvil accepts jobs up to level 39 (in creative mode the anvil limit is removed).
- Level 16 is a quarter of the way to level 30, while level 22 is about halfway there. Level 30 in turn, is halfway to level 39.
- Killing the ender dragon the first time gives approximately 68 XP levels. The ender dragon actually drops 10 waves of orbs worth a total of 1,000 experience points per wave, and another worth a total of 2,000. Taken separately, the smaller waves could take a player from zero to level 26, while the big wave would take a player from zero to level 34. The largest orb dropped has a value of 1237 experience points, and can take a player from zero to level 28 all by itself.
- The maximum level that players can get legitimately is 238,609,312, and at this level the experience bar disappears, because reaching the next level would require more XP than the 32-bit integer limit (2,147,483,647, which is 231- 1). However, it is possible to reach level 2,147,483,647 using commands. In this case, the experience bar may disappear and reappear.[6]
