Soul Speed can be acquired via bartering with piglins, who may offer enchanted books and iron boots with a random level of Soul Speed. Piglins may spawn wearing golden boots enchanted with Soul Speed which have a chance to be dropped when they are killed. Enchanted books and golden boots with a random level of Soul Speed may appear in bastion remnant "other" chests.

Soul Speed is a treasure enchantment. It cannot be obtained from enchanting in an enchanting table. Unlike most other treasure enchantments, it also cannot be obtained from most chest loot (except from chests in bastion remnants), fishing, or trading.

## Usage
### Speed
When walking on soul sand or soul soil, Soul Speed increases the player's speed. When wearing boots with Soul Speed, the player's speed is adjusted by the multiplier (Soul Speed Level * 0.105) + 1.3. The speed decrease of soul sand has no effect on Soul Speed, meaning that the player can walk on soul sand with the same speed as on soul soil.

While Soul Speed walkways are not as fast as some other means of transit (such as blue ice tracks), Soul Speed boots do not require vehicles such as minecarts or boats in order to apply their speed boost. This makes Soul Speed walkways useful for increasing movement speed across more uneven or varied terrain where vehicles might prove unwieldy. 

Carpets or slabs‌[JE  only] on top of soul sand or soul soil does not prevent the speed increase from Soul Speed.

| Enchantment level | Speed increase |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Soul Speed I      | 40.5%          |
| Soul Speed II     | 51%            |
| Soul Speed III    | 61.5%          |

### Durability
The durability of worn boots enchanted with Soul Speed has a 4% chance to go down for each compatible block stepped on. This chance can be decreased by 20/27/30 percent by enchanting the boots with Unbreaking I/II/III, respectively.

### Particles
Soul Particle
Soul particles appear when walking on one of the compatible blocks.

### General
The soul_speed_blocks tag determines which blocks are compatible with Soul Speed.
