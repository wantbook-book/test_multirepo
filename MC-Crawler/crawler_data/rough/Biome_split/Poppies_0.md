## Obtaining
### Breaking
A poppy can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

A poppy also breaks if water or lava runs over its location, if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

| Block    | Poppy               |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 0                   |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.05                |

### Natural generation
Poppies generate naturally on dirt and grass blocks in multiple biomes as part of vegetation features. In both Java Edition and Bedrock Edition, poppies can be found in the following biomes:

- Plains
- Sunflower Plains
- Meadow
- Flower Forest

In Java Edition, poppies can also generate in many additional biomes:

- Savanna
- Savanna Plateau
- Windswept Savanna
- Snowy Plains
- Forest
- Birch Forest
- Old Growth Birch Forest
- Taiga
- Old Growth Spruce Taiga
- Old Growth Pine Taiga
- Snowy Taiga
- Jungle
- Bamboo Jungle
- Sparse Jungle
- Dark Forest
- Windswept Hills
- Windswept Gravelly Hills
- Windswept Forest
- River
- Frozen River

In Java Edition, the following additional biomes are also technically allowed to generate poppies, although they very rarely or never generate grass blocks on the surface in normal worlds. As a result, poppies can generate only in edge cases or custom worlds.

- Beach
- Snowy Beach
- Stony Shore
- Ocean
- Deep Ocean
- Cold Ocean
- Deep Cold Ocean
- Frozen Ocean
- Deep Frozen Ocean
- Lukewarm Ocean
- Deep Lukewarm Ocean
- Warm Ocean
- Desert
- Ice Spikes
- Dripstone Caves
- Deep Dark

In jungles, bamboo jungles, sparse jungles, savannas and savanna plateaus, poppies are twice as common as in other biomes. In flower forests and meadows, poppies only generate as part of gradients.

Natural poppies are found in plains, savanna, and taiga villages, as well as snowy villages in Bedrock Edition. Potted poppies can also generate in woodland mansions.


### Post-generation
Main article: Flower § Post-generation
#### Java Edition
When bone meal is applied to a grass block in one of the biomes listed above, poppies have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area. In meadows and flower forests, poppies can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains, sunflower plains, dripstone caves, and the deep dark, poppies cannot generate in tulip-only areas.

#### Bedrock Edition
When bone meal is applied to a grass block in plains, sunflower plains, and flower forest, poppies have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 7×5×7 area. In flower forests, poppies can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains and sunflower plains, poppies cannot generate in tulip-only areas.

When bone meal is applied to a poppy that has been placed on top of a grass block in any biome, more poppies appear on top of nearby grass blocks. Dandelions can also occasionally appear, and poppies can occasionally appear when bone meal is applied to dandelions. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.

### Mob loot
Iron golems drop 0 to 2 poppies upon death. This is unaffected by the Looting enchantment.

Endermen can pick up poppies, like any other one-block-tall flower, and drop one if killed while holding it.

In Java Edition, baby villagers may give a poppy to players with the Hero of the Village effect.
