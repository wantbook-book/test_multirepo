### Neutral mobs
Neutral mobs are sometimes passive and sometimes hostile toward the player. These mobs usually require provocation from the player in one way or another to attack or become hostile, while some can be naturally-hostile and have a way to be pacified.

### Boss mobs
Boss mobs are special hostile mobs that are distinctly more dangerous and tougher than other mobs. They do not spawn randomly, and are confronted intentionally. All of them also have a bossbar featuring their name and health. Boss mobs provide unique challenges but also equivalent rewards.

## Mob vote
In 2016, Jeb held an informal poll on Twitter in which the public voted on adding the llama to Minecraft over the alpaca.[3][4] In the six annual Minecraft events MINECON Earth 2017, MINECON Earth 2018, MINECON Live 2019, Minecraft Live 2020, Minecraft Live 2021 and Minecraft Live 2022, the public also voted on a mob to be added to Minecraft. In the first vote, the winner was the phantom (then known as "Mob B" or "The Monster of the Night Skies"). In the second, the winner was the taiga biome and the fox. In the third, the winner was the mountain biome and the goat (the swamp was ranked second and was updated in the Wild Update, adding frogs and tadpoles). In the fourth, the winner was the glow squid. In the fifth, the winner was the allay. In the sixth, the winner was the sniffer. In the seventh, the winner was the armadillo. Shortly before the second vote, the China Edition had a unrelated popularity poll, the winner of which was the panda. Shortly after the second vote, there was also a vote for which new cat skin would be added, the winner of which was Jellie.

## Classification
Most of the mobs are divided into different types, such as the animals or the monsters, but some creatures are assigned to a more detailed group. There are a total of four mob classifications that have different effects than other mobs.
