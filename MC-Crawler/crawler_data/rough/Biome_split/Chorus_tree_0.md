## Generation
Chorus plants generate on the outer islands of the End, in End highlands. They are formed in tall, coral-like patterns. They are the only source of chorus fruit and chorus flowers. The player can grow a new chorus plant by planting such a flower on a block of end stone.

## Construction
Chorus plants consist of chorus plant blocks and chorus flowers. A chorus flower generates at the top of each branch. A branch stops growing when the chorus flower on the branch reaches age 5, but it can be harvested and replanted to reset the age. Plant heights range between 5 and 22 blocks, although most stop growing before they reach 16 blocks tall.
