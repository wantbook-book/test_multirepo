### Huge mushroom
Main article: Huge mushroom
While loosely defined as a tree, these are features generated in certain biomes. Instead of logs and leaves, they consist of mushroom stems and mushroom blocks, which don't decay. When harvested without Silk Touch, they drop mushrooms.
They come in two variants, brown and red.

- A huge red mushroom.
- A huge brown mushroom.

### Chorus plant
Main article: Chorus plant
While loosely defined as a tree, these are features generated on the outermost End islands. Instead of logs and leaves, they are instead comprised of chorus plant trunk blocks and flowers on the tip. They do not drop their own block but instead chorus fruit.
They are usually extremely tall, with multiple branches. When the bottom of the chorus tree is cut, the whole chorus tree falls apart, dropping their fruit. The branches are tipped with "chorus flowers", which do not drop when the tree is broken, but can separately be broken (and dropped) by any tool, bare hands, or the impact of any projectile.  When a chorus flower is placed on end stone, it grows into a chorus tree over time — unlike most trees, this is a step-wise process as the chorus flower generates branches one block at a time.

- A chorus plant.

### Variant trees

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition and  Minecraft Education. 


In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, trees can generate as one of the two following variants of the normal tree. Both of these generate naturally, and can be grown out of normal saplings.[1][2]

#### Dying trees
The different dying tree types.
These trees have the standard growth pattern of any other tree, however, all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with vines. They can generate as dark oak, jungle, spruce, small oak trees or be grown from saplings.

#### Fallen trees
These trees consist of a single upright log, or stump. Logs lying on their side are often found 1–2 blocks from the stump.

Oak, spruce, birch, tall birch, and jungle trees can generate as fallen trees.

- Birch Fallen Log
- Oak Fallen Log
- Spruce Fallen Log
- Jungle Fallen Log

This section is missing information about whether cold-en oaks existed
are there any seeds known to generate these or any other confirmation of their existence?. 
Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page.


The "cold-en" oak was a tree formed by a rare glitch in older versions prior to v0.9.0. It was a small tree with a shape identical to that of a small oak or birch tree that is generated on the border of a forest and a snowy area (one of which is usually mountainous). It was made of spruce leaves and spruce logs (seen in both the "lite" and paid versions prior to v0.9.0) or, rarely, oak logs (paid only). Its rarity is compared to the modified jungle edge.

- A cold-en oak tree recreated in Java Edition.
- A naturally generated spruce log cold-en oak, found in v0.8.1.

## Foliage colors
Main article: Color
Depending on where the tree generates, the color of the leaves may differ. For example, if an oak tree is in a colder biome, such as a taiga or windswept hills biome, it has a blue-green hue. In a snowy taiga, the leaves are white with a slight grey tint. However, if it is in a dry biome, such as a desert or savanna, it has a mustard yellow hue. Spruce, birch, azalea, and cherry leaves do not follow these rules; they always have the same color regardless of the biome.

- Foliage color in wetter biomes.
- Foliage color in drier biomes.
- Foliage color in colder biomes.

Leaves are checked individually for biome coloration rather than as part of a larger tree; as such, trees that were grown between biomes usually have multiple shades on each side.

- A tree grown between two biomes.
- A tree situated on the boundary of a jungle, swamp and desert biome, showing skins of all three on its leaves.
- An acacia tree split between a savanna biome and a swamp biome.
