## Description
Forests feature dense trees compared to other biomes. Lily of the valley, rose bushes, peonies and lilacs generate in this biome family along with the usual dandelions; in Java Edition, poppies also generate here. Grass takes on a dark but vibrant green color. Bees from bee nests on trees are found as well. 

Like almost every other Overworld biome in the game, lava lakes can generate here, which can cause locally destructive forest fires, due to the density of flammable logs and leaves; the same goes for lightning strikes that hit the trees during thunderstorms, though the fires caused by the strikes are usually quickly put out by the rain.

The forest is one of the most preferred biomes to start a survival world, serving abundant amounts of wood, grass, water, caves and passive mobs, and they do not have many dangers aside from the usual hostile mobs. Shallow lakes sometimes generate in a forest. Tamed wolves can help fight against hostile mobs, making them especially useful when players lack resources for armor. The density of the trees, however, can obstruct vision and get a player lost quickly; random surface-level lava lakes are possible, albeit rare, and start forest fires when close to trees. Building shelter here might be frustrating, due to having to clean up the zone before.

The following mobs are naturally spawned here：
