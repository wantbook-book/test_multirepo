## Sources
Experience orbs can be gained from several different sources:

- From killing most mobs, which drop experience orbs along with any other items.
	- A mob does not drop experience orbs unless it dies within five seconds (100 game ticks) of an attack registered as a player hit (including tamedwolves, player thrown fireballs, and TNT). This allows gaining experience orbs from, say, knocking a monster off a cliff, lighting a mob on fire, etc. (fetching the orbs might be another question). Theplayercan also try to "claim" a burning monster by hitting or shooting it once—even if the blow doesn't kill it, if the mob dies within 5 seconds, it drops experience orbs.
	- Deaths ofzombified piglinsalways register as kills by the player they are targeting, regardless of whether that player ever touched that zombified piglin.[2]
	- Mobs killed byTNTactivated by a player usingflint and steelor a flaming arrow drop XP as usual; however, mobs killed by TNT that was activated by fire,redstone, or an explosion that wasn'tplayeractivated does not drop any experience orbs.
	- Mobsdrop a random number of experience orbs, which can have different values. However, the total value always remains within the values given below, regardless ofdifficultysetting.
	- Hostile mobs give more experience orbs than passive ones. Baby animals,bats,golems, andvillagersgive no experience orbs at all. Theender dragongives experience orbs totaling 12,000 XP the first time aplayerkills it—12 times more than anything else in the game—and 500 XP in subsequent defeats.
		- Some hostilemobsspawn with weapons, orcanspawn with weapons and/orarmor. These mobs give an extra 1–3 points (randomly) per piece of equipment that they spawned with. Equipment picked up after spawning doesn't count.
	- Mining(destroying) amonster spawnerblock gives 15–43 points of experience orbs.
	- While they do not drop experience orbs normally, baby mobs as well as mobs killed by non-player means are accepted by thesculk catalyst, allowing for experience orbs to be obtained in a more indirect way.
- Fromminingany ore that drops a resource, rather than raw metals or themselves. The experience orbs are produced along with the mineral item(s). If aSilk Touchpickaxe is used to mine the ore block, the experience is not dropped, but the block can later be placed and mined normally to release the mineral and the experience.
	- The ore still produces orbs if destroyed by an explosion, whether or not it was caused by player activated TNT.
- Fromsmeltingany of various items.
	- Smelting any ore yields some experience, but normally onlynether gold oreandancient debrisare worthwhile. For all other ores,mining them is better.
	- Moderate amounts are gained by smelting/cooking other materials: food, clay balls or blocks,cactus, wood logs, sand, or cobblestone, cactus giving the most.‌[JE  only]
	- The smelted material must be taken from the furnace through its GUI window. If the player uses a hopper to unload the furnace, it is possible to retrieve all experience produced by the furnace by smelting an extra item and taking it from the GUI. Breaking the furnace drops all stored experience as collectable experience orbs.
- Frombreedinganimals, which produces orbs where the parents are, along with the baby animal. Breakingeggsdoes not give experience.
- Fromfishing. The experience is awarded immediately upon reeling in the fish, even if the fish itself is not picked up.
- Fromtradingwith villagers.
- Abottle o' enchantingreleases orbs when broken.
- From the/experiencecommand.
- From disenchanting items in agrindstone.
- From completing a challengeadvancement.‌[JE  only]

Gathering experience points from experience orbs increases the player's experience level by gradually filling a bar on the bottom of the screen until a new level is achieved when the bar is full. When the player dies, they drop experience orbs worth 7 * current level experience points, up to a maximum of 100 points (enough to reach level 7), and all of the other experience vanishes. If the gamerule keepInventory is set to true, the experience is kept even if the player dies.
