During the livestream, viewers could vote for one of three biomes that will be updated. The biome with the highest vote will get new features, such as terrain changes and new mobs, in the next major update. The winner, Mountains, got snowier snow, goats, and new mountain terrain generation.[5] The Swamp was later added to The Wild Update, and the Badlands will also be getting new features, but at a later date.[6] Mountains were voted as the first biome to be updated.[7]

### Badlands
Tumbleweeds, vultures, and a new type of flowery cactus are planned to be added. Badlands was voted as the last biome to be updated in the first poll.[8]

### Swamp
Boats with chests, frogs, and mangroves were planned to be added.[9] Swamp was voted as the second biome to be updated in the second poll, which later became a part of The Wild Update.

### Mountains
Powder snow, goats, improved mountain terrain generation, and more mountain biomes were planned to be added. Mountains were voted as the first biome to be updated in the final poll,[7] which later became a part of the Caves & Cliffs update.

### Results
Mountains won the Biome Vote.
