## Mechanics
To barter with a piglin, the player must either drop a gold ingot near an adult piglin or use a gold ingot on it. After the piglin takes the gold ingot and examines it for six seconds in Java Edition or eight seconds in Bedrock Edition[1], it tosses a random item to the player. Piglin brutes ignore gold ingots and do not barter. Baby piglins take the ingot without giving anything in return, instead holding the ingot, which is dropped when killed.

Piglins pick up many other items that are made of gold; however, ingots are the only items that piglins accept for bartering.

Hitting a piglin causes it to "confiscate" the ingot; the piglin does not complete the barter. It cannot be bartered with again unless it puts another item in its inventory. Piglins who are killed in one hit before they finish examining always drop the ingot.

When a piglin is admiring a gold ingot, it can still be angered by the player breaking a container or a gold-related block nearby, although its behavior differs depending on the game edition. In Java Edition, the piglin finishes the barter on the original schedule, and only starts attacking the player once the barter finishes. In Bedrock Edition, the piglin immediately finishes the barter and starts attacking the player,[2] leading to a bartering transaction much shorter than the default 8 seconds.[3] This allows piglins in Bedrock Edition to barter rapidly when gold-related blocks are repeatedly broken nearby, or when a gold-related block is repeatedly pushed and pulled by pistons.

Bartering is controlled by the loot table minecraft:gameplay/piglin_bartering. If the game rule mobGriefing is false, piglins only barter when the player uses a gold ingot on them.

In Java Edition, if a piglin is zombified into a zombified piglin before the bartering is complete, the newly-zombified piglin drops the gold ingot immediately. In Bedrock Edition, the zombified piglin continues to hold the gold ingot after zombification and only drops it upon death.

When a piglin is admiring a gold ingot while bartering, it does not run away from nearby zoglins or nearby zombified piglins.
