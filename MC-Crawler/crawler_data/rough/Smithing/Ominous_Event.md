## Behavior
When a player with the Bad Omen effect walks into one of the correct areas (or the world) at one of the correct times, the Bad Omen effect transforms into another Omen, which subsequently triggers an ominous event.

## Variants
### Raid

Main article: Raid
When a player walks into a village while having Bad Omen, the effect is immediately replaced with Raid Omen, with an effect duration of 30 seconds.

A raid event is triggered when the Raid Omen effect naturally expires. During a raid, the raiders (i.e. illagers, witches, and ravagers) seek out villagers, iron golems, and players to attack. When a player is given the Raid Omen effect, the location where they are standing is remembered as the focus of the raid. Raiders start the raid by traveling toward this point, but are easily distracted if they see anything worth attacking.

If a player with Raid Omen loses the effect via commands or a milk bucket, the Raid Omen does not trigger a raid. This means the player has 30 seconds to consume a remedy when they enter a village in order to prevent a raid from occurring.

### Ominous Trial

Main article: Ominous Trial
When a player with Bad Omen enters within 15 blocks of a trial spawner, the Bad Omen is immediately replaced with Trial Omen, which immediately triggers an ominous trial event. The Trial Omen lasts for 15 minutes per level of Bad Omen that the player had.

An ominous trial event is triggered without delay, and varies in size and duration depending on how many trial spawners a player activates. When a player with Trial Omen enters within 15 blocks of a trial spawner, the spawner immediately activates and becomes ominous (i.e. it becomes an Ominous Trial Spawner). The player can activate multiple spawners this way, making the ominous trial last for longer.

A player can also prevent the ominous trial from being expanded to more trial spawners by consuming a remedy (i.e. milk or commands) and removing the Trial Omen effect. This does not pause or slow down any existing ominous trial spawners. The ominous trial event continues until all of the ominous trial spawners are defeated and become inactive.
