### Upgrading
Like other diamond tools, a diamond hoe can be upgraded to a netherite hoe, increasing its durability and slightly increasing its mining speed, as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item.

A hoe can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the hoe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two hoes of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the hoe's enchantments.

1. ↑ a bAll enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.
2. ↑ a bEnchantment probabilities are the same as a level-30 to level-50 enchantment would be on an enchantment table that had no cap at level 30, and that was able to apply treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and where the chance of multiple enchantments is not reduced.
3. ↑ a bThe item has between 80% and 100% of its total durability.

### Trading
Novice-level toolsmith villagers have a chance to sell a stone hoe for one emerald, and journeyman-level toolsmiths have a chance to sell a diamond hoe for 4 emeralds. In Bedrock Edition, these are 25% chances, and in Java Edition, these are 40% chances.

### Villager gifts
Toolsmith villagers occasionally throw stone hoes at players with the Hero of the Village status effect.‌[Java Edition  only]

## Usage
### Harvesting
Hoes are used to harvest certain plant-based or organic blocks more quickly. Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 durability.

1. ↑Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

Breaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise.

### Tilling
Hoes are used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into farmland. To till, press use on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on mycelium or podzol,[1] nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including snow layers or torches. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe.

Hoes can be used to convert coarse dirt into regular dirt by pressing use on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled.

Hoes can also be used on rooted dirt, which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a hanging roots item.

Tilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block.

Hoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt.[2]

### Weapon
A hoe loses 2 points of durability when used as a weapon. Hoes may be used as a weapon, although they deal only 1 damage in Java Edition, identical to that of a bare hand. In Bedrock Edition, hoes do equal damage to pickaxes of the same tier.

#### Java Edition
Hoes have differing attack speeds depending on the material, and all deal 1 damage.

| Material                          | Wooden   | Gold  | Stone    | Iron      | Diamond   | Netherite   |
|-----------------------------------|----------|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Attack Damage                     | 1        | 1     | 1        | 1         | 1         | 1           |
| Attack Speed                      | 1        | 1     | 2        | 3         | 4         | 4           |

| Durability                        | 59       | 32    | 131      | 250       | 1561      | 2031        |
| Lifetime damage inflicted[note 4] | 29× 14.5 | 16× 8 | 65× 32.5 | 125× 62.5 | 780× 390  | 1015× 507.5 |

1. ↑Effective DPS is limited at 2 due to the 0.5 second invulnerabity timer.
2. ↑Effective DPS is limited at 2 due to the 0.5 second invulnerabity timer.
3. ↑Effective DPS is limited at 2 due to the 0.5 second invulnerabity timer.
4. ↑The formula to find the total lifetime damage is ceil(durability ÷ 2) × damage per hit. The durability is halved then ceiled because hoes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.

#### Bedrock Edition
In Bedrock Edition, hoes have no attack cooldown, and deal the following damage:

| Material                          | Wooden | Gold   | Stone    | Iron       | Diamond    | Netherite  |
|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|------------|------------|------------|

| Durability                        | 60     | 33     | 132      | 251        | 1562       | 2032       |
| Lifetime damage inflicted[note 1] | 90× 45 | 48× 24 | 264× 132 | 625× 312.5 | 4686× 2343 | 7112× 3556 |

### Enchantments
A hoe can receive the following enchantments:

| Name               | Description                                         | Max Level | Method                     | Weight |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------|--------|

| Fortune[note 2]    | Increases the amount ofdropswhen mining.            | III       | Enchanting Table<br/>Anvil | 2      |
| Silk Touch[note 2] | Causes blocks to drop themselves when mined.        | I         | Enchanting Table<br/>Anvil | 1      |
| Unbreaking         | Grants a chance to negate durability consumption.   | III       | Enchanting Table<br/>Anvil | 5      |

| Curse of Vanishing | The hoe vanishes on death, not dropping as an item. | I         | Anvil                      | 1      |

The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.
2. ↑ a bSilk Touch and Fortune are mutually exclusive

### Fuel
Wooden hoes can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1 item per hoe.

### Smelting ingredient

### Piglins
Piglins are attracted to golden hoes and run toward any golden hoes on the ground, and inspect them for 6 to 8 seconds before putting them in their inventory.
