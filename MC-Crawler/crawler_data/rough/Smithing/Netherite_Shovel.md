#### Unit repair
Main article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair
Repair & NameDamaged Netherite Shovel
A netherite shovel can be repaired in an anvil by adding netherite ingots, with each ingot restoring 25% of the shovel's maximum durability, rounded down. Two netherite shovels can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the shovel's enchantments.

## Usage
### Digging
A netherite shovel can be used to break dirt and soil-type materials faster. When breaking a block, it uses 1 durability. For blocks that break instantly, it uses 0 durability.

### Dirt paths
A netherite shovel can be used to create a dirt path by using (not digging) the shovel on any one of the following blocks, losing one durability point:

- Grass Block
- Dirt
- Coarse Dirt
- Rooted Dirt
- Podzol
- Mycelium

### Campfire
A netherite shovel can be used to extinguish a campfire.

### Weapon
Netherite shovels take 2 damage when used as a weapon.

#### Java Edition
Netherite shovels have an attack speed modifier of -3, meaning they take 1 second to recover. Netherite shovels deal 6.5 × 3.25 damage.

#### Bedrock Edition
Netherite shovels always attack instantly and do 6 damage.

### Enchantments
A netherite shovel can receive the following enchantments:
