# Attribute
Attributes are values which dictate certain properties of mobs, armor stands, and players. Attributes also have modifiers that adjust the strength of their effect.

## Applying attributes
Attributes can be applied directly to living entities using the /attribute command. The below command is an example which increases the luck attribute, leading to the player being able to fish treasures nearly every time:

/attribute @p minecraft:generic.luck base set 1024

Additionally, attribute values can be specified when summoning a mob. For example, the following command summons a zombie that follows players when they are 100 blocks or less from it instead of the usual 40:

/summon zombie ~ ~ ~ {Attributes:[{Name:"generic.follow_range", Base:100.0}]}

Attributes can also be applied as attribute modifiers on items. When applied to an item, a modifier adjusts the corresponding attribute if the item is held or worn.[1][2] Attribute modifiers can be added to items by adding data tags to the item. The UUIDs for these modifiers should be randomly chosen to prevent accidentally using the same UUID as another modifier.

The following command gives the player a netherite sword that deals 20 Ã— 10 extra damage. If the player changes the operation from 0 to 1 it multiplies the attack damage instead:

/give @s netherite_sword{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:"generic.attack_damage", Name:"generic.attack_damage", Amount:20.0, Operation:0, UUID:[I; 42853, 1689024593, -201178, -1559272105]}]} 1

The player can also specify what slot has certain attributes:

/give @p diamond_axe{AttributeModifiers:[{Slot:"mainhand", AttributeName:"generic.attack_damage", Name:"generic.attack_damage", Amount:20.0, Operation:0, UUID:[I; -192596, -61963, -161679, -10288428]}]} 1

The slot can be mainhand, offhand, head, chest, legs or feet.

The following command gives players with this item in their offhand extremely high attack speed to the point where the attack cooldown is virtually nonexistent. 

/give @s shield{Unbreakable:1,AttributeModifiers:[{Slot:"offhand", AttributeName:"generic.attack_speed", Name:"generic.attack_speed", Amount:1000.0, Operation:0, UUID:[I; -110663, 103297, -1423577, 206238]}]} 1

## Attributes
An individual attribute controls some property, described by its name. An attribute always has a base value, and may have any number of modifiers. Attributes also have a default value (used when spawning a mob with an undefined attribute base), and hard-coded minimum and maximum values. Modifiers act on an attribute's base, but the calculated value is always capped by the minimum and maximum.

Note that attribute modifiers that have the same UUID and affect the same attribute do not stack; only the one that most recently affected a player or mob has an effect, overriding the previously affecting modifier(s).

These attributes are found on all living entities, including players.

## Modifiers
Modifiers act upon the base value of an attribute, increasing or decreasing it. Note that the resulting value after modification is capped by the attribute's minimum and maximum. Like attributes, modifiers have a name, however, this name does not define the modifier's behavior. Instead, a modifier's behavior is determined by its operation. Modifiers also carry an amount to their modification, and a UUID to uniquely identify the modifier.

### Operations
A modifier's operation dictates how it modifies an attribute's base value. Three operations exist:

add (amount +/-): Saved as operation 0. Adds all of the modifiers' amounts to the current value of the attribute. For example, modifying an attribute with {Amount:2,Operation:0} and {Amount:4,Operation:0} with a Base of 3 results in 9 (3 + 2 + 4 = 9).

multiply_base (amountÂ % +/-, additive): Saved as operation 1. Multiplies the current value of the attribute by (1 + x), where x is the sum of the modifiers' amounts. For example, modifying an attribute with {Amount:2,Operation:1} and {Amount:4,Operation:1} with a Base of 3 results in 21 (3 * (1 + 2 + 4) = 21).

multiply (amountÂ % +/-, multiplicative): Saved as operation 2. For every modifier, multiplies the current value of the attribute by (1 + x), where x is the amount of the particular modifier. Functions the same as Operation 1 if there is only a single modifier with operation 1 or 2. However, for multiple modifiers it multiplies the modifiers rather than adding them. For example, modifying an attribute with {Amount:2,Operation:2} and {Amount:4,Operation:2} with a Base of 3 results in 45 (3 * (1 + 2) * (1 + 4) = 45).[5]

The mathematical behavior is as follows:

- add: Increment X by Amount
- multiply_base: Increment Y by X * Amount
- multiply: Y = Y * (1 + Amount) (equivalent to Increment Y by Y * Amount).

The game first sets X = Base, then executes all Operation add, then sets Y = X, then executes all multiply_base modifiers, and finally executes all multiply modifiers.

### Vanilla modifiers
As stated before, a modifier's name can be anything, and this does not affect its behavior. The following are known modifier names and values used in vanilla Minecraft. Note that some UUIDs are generated on-the-fly, while others are represented as fixed strings in the code - these have been listed as well. If a UUID is not listed, this means that it is different every time the modifier is created.
