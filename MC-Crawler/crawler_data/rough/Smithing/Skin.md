## Properties
Skins are divided into areas that act as the surface area of the character (for example, the front head area, left leg area, etc.). There are a total of 3,264 pixels that can be customized, with 1,632 on each layer. Skins with slim arms have 3,136 pixels, with 1568 pixels on each layer. The second layer can be used to give the character glasses, hats, or other accessories (even a bigger head).

In Java Edition, a skin allows only a solid color; transparency is not allowed on the skin file except on the second layer, which is transparent by default; playing offline, pixels can be left free resulting in "holes" in the skin. If a skin with transparent pixels on the first layer is uploaded, the transparent pixels render as black pixels in-game.

In Bedrock Edition, skins can have double the resolution of a normal skin. This means the skin template can be up to 128×128 instead of just 64×64. The normal templates still apply, but players get 4× the amount of pixels to work with, since both dimensions have been doubled. Transparency can be used, even on the first layer, though there needs to be at least one visible pixel, so a fully invisible skin can't be made. The transparency must also be 0% or 100% as translucent colors are not allowed in either layer.

Pixel size of the 2nd layer on body, arms and legs is 0.25 pixel bigger than the skin pixel (inner layer).
For head 2nd layer (Hat layer) it is 0.5 pixels bigger than the skin layer (inner layer).

## World textures
Main article: Resource pack
A skin can also refer to other textures in the game, such as block textures, item sprites, mob skins, etc. A list of these can be found here.

It is worth noting that a zombie and its variants can use typical player skins (and vice-versa). Skeleton mobs can use typical player skins as well, but keep in mind that they have their skinny arms and legs. If a skeleton mob skin is used as a player's skin, their legs and arms do not appear skinny.

In order to use the player skin for zombies, the user must align it to the correct place on the .png to avoid a visual break in the texture.

## Changing or installing player skins
### Java Edition

Only players who have purchased Minecraft can change their character's skin. This is done on the profile page or in the Minecraft Launcher by uploading a valid .png texture that is 64×64 pixels, or a legacy texture that is 64×32 pixels, which then replaces the default skin.
- What the Minecraft websites profile page looks like.
- What the Change Skin page on the Minecraft website looks like.
- What the Minecraft Launchers Skin Tab looks like.
- What it looks like to add a new skin in the Minecraft Launcher.

Skins also have the option of having either 3 or 4 pixel wide arms, which can be changed on the profile page as well.[1]

The steve.png and alex.png files in client.jar can also be changed and replaced via a resource pack, but the effects are visible only to players using the resource pack, and affects all players with the default skin.

1. ↑ a bThe country-based skins are references to the countries developing the game; Mojang is located in Sweden, and 4J Studios is located in Scotland.

### Bedrock Edition
Since Pocket Edition v0.11.0 alpha, players can choose one of the two default skins either Steve or Alex, and can apply their own custom skin. (Uses the same format as the Java edition). The player must select a valid skin image from their photo library, and must choose between the two main models. Players can also spend Minecraft Coins to buy skin packs. The Legacy Skin Pack was also implemented in Bedrock Edition, but the player has to sign in to Xbox Live to access all the skins. It also includes five anonymous skins. Players can also make their own skin packs, which must include a manifest.json file, a skins.json file, and all the desired skins. An additional .lang file can be added inside a folder labeled texts to display the skin names, but the game can register the skins without it.

## Character creator
Main article: Character creator

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition. 


The character creator menu.
The character creator is a feature in Bedrock Edition (and was in Minecraft Earth until discontinuation) that lets players customize their skins with free and paid-for cosmetic items. It can be accessed by selecting the character profile button on the main menu. It can also be used to equip capes. Many clothing items cost Minecoins (Tokens on PlayStation 4), or can be earned by completing certain achievements.

## Skin packs
Main article: Skin packs

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition. 


Skin Packs are available in Bedrock Edition as downloadable content. They can be acquired:

- through theMarketplace. Most of them cost Minecoins (Tokens on PS4), but some have been released for free.
- through.mcskinfiles put in theskin_packsordevelopment_skin_packsfolder in the game files (accessible only on Windows 10, Android, iOS, iPadOS, and Fire devices).

### Java Edition Skin Packs

## Templates

Many players prefer their own unique skin. While many premade skins can be found online, many players prefer to create their own.

A custom skin is a way to personalize the player model and can be done either by using a variety of community-made skin editors, or by editing the steve.png or alex.png file manually with an image editor like Photoshop, GIMP, Paint.net or similar image editors. The steve.png file can be downloaded here and the alex.png file here. When editing the steve.png or alex.png file manually, be sure to keep the original image dimensions and make the background of the skin (the unused pixels) completely transparent. Otherwise, Minecraft may fail to recognize the skin as intended.

Alternatively, some may find it easier to use a program, either downloadable or in-browser, which provides a live view of their character on a three-dimensional model as they are editing the skin.  For example, programs may further assist players by providing them with a wide variety of pre-made selections (such as hats, boots, sweaters, etc.), to give the skin creator exactly what they want, even if the creator has little to no artistic skill.

After making a custom skin, either by using a skin editor or by editing the steve.png file directly, one still needs to upload the .png file at the Skin section of the Profile page on Minecraft.net (found here) before the skin is applied. Other players in multiplayer can also see this skin. Note that players cannot see the custom skin if they are not logged in or when playing offline.

### Official skin templates

### Other templates
- The modern layered skin template; every body part can have a second layer, marked by the darker palette areas.
- An adaptation of the previous template, color-coded to match the appropriate faces of the skin: front, back, left, right, top and bottom. The checked areas represent the secondary layer.
- A template for the slim arms/"Alex" model.
- An adaptation of the slimmer arms template, color-coded to match the appropriate faces of the skin: front, back, left, right, top and bottom. The checked areas represent the secondary layer.
- Another skin template.
- Color-coded old skin template with all faces labeled.
- Another skin guide, but on a black background. For the arm and leg sections only, "right" indicates those facing outward, and "left" indicates inward.
- Deadmau5's skin (not a guide). Notice the ears. See also: Easter eggs § deadmau5's ears

## Number of Skins
The total number of possible unique player skins varies immensely, depending on what is considered "unique". In the table below, there are four different definitions with a cell of its corresponding number of skins, along with an approximation. Usually, skins can only have transparent pixels on the outer layer, while in singleplayer Minecraft Java Edition, skins can also have transparent pixels on the inner layer. The bottom row of the table below includes skins with inner layers with transparent pixels, and the row above doesn't. Another factor is how there are 224 fully transparent colors, which could either be considered unique or identical. The right column of the table considers each transparent color to be unique, while the column to its left considers all fully transparent colors to be identical.

In the "All 0-Alpha Pixels Unique" column, the definitions are relatively simple, 291392 + 287808 and 2104448 + 2100352, with an integer power of two for the number of 4 px skins added to an integer power of two for the number of 3 px skins. The "All 0-Alpha Pixels Same" column has far more complicated definitions. This is because just to calculate the number of unique colors including alpha, it has to take the 224 unique RGB colors, multiply that by the 255 non-fully-transparent colors, then add the single fully transparent color.

In an AntVenom video, he calculated a total of 281600 × 53264 (≈3.060 133 2201 × 1026845) skins. The rules he used were to only include 4 px skins, only allow transparent pixels on the top layer, consider all fully transparent pixels to be unique, and include only 100 possible alpha values.
