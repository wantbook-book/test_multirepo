Boots can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the boots' maximum durability, rounded down. Two boots of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the boots' enchantments.

1. ↑ a b c d e fAll enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.
2. ↑ a b c dEnchantment probabilities are the same as a level-20 to level-39 enchantment would be on an enchantment table that had no cap at level 30, and that was able to apply treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and where the chance of multiple enchantments is not reduced.
3. ↑ a bEnchanted with a random level of Soul Speed.
4. ↑ a bThe item has between 80% and 100% of its total durability.

### Mob loot
If a zombie, husk, stray, piglin, or skeleton is wearing armor, there is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop boots upon death. The boots are usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted.

Zombie is shown wearing full iron armor set, including boots.
In Bedrock Edition, vindicators and pillagers that spawn in raids have a chance to drop iron boots, which are usually badly damaged and have a 50% chance to be enchanted.

### Trading
In Java Edition, novice-level armorer villagers have 40% chance to sell iron boots for 4 emeralds. Apprentice-level armorers have a 50% chance to sell chainmail boots for an emerald. Expert-level armorers always sell enchanted[note 1] diamond boots for 11–27 emeralds. Apprentice-level leatherworker villagers have 2⁄3 chance to sell leather boots for 4 emeralds.

Armorer villagers may give the players with the Hero of the Village effect chainmail boots.‌[Java Edition  only]

In Bedrock Edition, novice-level armorer villagers have a 25% chance to sell iron boots for 4 emeralds. Apprentice-level armorers have a 1⁄3 chance to sell chainmail boots for an emerald. Expert-level armorers have a 50% chance to sell enchanted[note 1] diamond boots for 8 emeralds. Apprentice-level leatherworker villagers have a 50% chance to sell leather boots for 4 emeralds.

1. ↑ a bWhen creating an enchantment offer, the game uses a random enchantment level from 5 – 19. The enchantments are never treasure enchantments.

### Bartering
Piglins may barter iron boots with Soul Speed when given a gold ingot.

### Fishing
Leather boots can be caught as a "junk" item when fishing.

## Usage
Boots can be placed in the fourth armor slot of a player's inventory for activation.

### Defense points
Defense points are each signified by half of a chestplate in the armor bar above the health bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.

The following table shows the amount of defense points added by boots.

| Material  | Defense points |
|-----------|----------------|
| Leather   | 1 ()           |
| Golden    |                |
| Chainmail |                |
| Iron      | 2 ()           |
| Diamond   | 3 ()           |
| Netherite |                |

### Knockback resistance
Netherite boots provide 10% knockback resistance.

### Durability
The following table shows the amount of damage each piece of armor can absorb before being destroyed.

Any "hit" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken that armor doesn't protect (such as falling or drowning) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits boots can endure.

Netherite armor is not damaged by lava or fire when worn.

| Material       | Durability |
|----------------|------------|
| Leather        | 65         |
| Golden         | 91         |
| Chainmail/Iron | 195        |
| Diamond        | 429        |
| Netherite      | 481        |

### Enchantments
Boots can receive the following enchantments:

| Name                          | Description                                         | Max Level | Method                                           | Weight |

2. ↑ a bFrost Walker and Depth Strider are mutually exclusive.

### Armor trimming
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a pair of boots, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, or diamond).

These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.

### Piglins
Piglins are attracted to golden boots and pick them up, examining them for 6 to 8 seconds. Other boots do not attract piglins but can be worn by them. They prefer stronger boots over weaker boots, with one major exception: They always prefer golden boots over all other boots, throwing out stronger boots to equip them. Enchanted boots are preferred over unenchanted boots.

### Powder snow
Leather boots can be used to safely cross powder snow without sinking in it. The block behaves similar to scaffolding, allowing the player to sink in by pressing crouch and move up by pressing jump. The boots also prevent the wearer from taking freezing damage.
