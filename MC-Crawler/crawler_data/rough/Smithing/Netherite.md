# Netherite
Netherite is a material from the Nether, used primarily to upgrade diamond gear. Netherite items are more powerful and durable than diamond, and in dropped item form are resistant to fire or lava. Netherite blocks are also unbreakable by the strongest explosions from normal gameplay, with the exception of blue wither skulls.
