### Armor trimming
It is possible to upgrade turtle shells with trims. This requires a smithing template, a turtle shell, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, or diamond).

These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.

### Turtle shell effect
Equipping a  turtle shell provides the Water Breathing status effect, allowing the player to remain underwater for an additional 10 seconds. The time that this effect lasts does not begin to count down until the player dives underwater, then the 10 seconds are counted down. The effect immediately recharges after exposure to air.
