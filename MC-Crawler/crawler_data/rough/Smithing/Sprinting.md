# Sprinting
Sprinting is a method of transportation that allows the player to move faster, at the expense of depleting saturation. While sprinting, the player's field of view expands slightly while increasing the player's reach by .5-1 block. Players also inflict more knockback on the first hit when sprinting.

## Activating
To sprint, the player can press sprint while moving, or double tap forward. The player cannot sprint if their hunger bar is at 6 () or below, or when they are under the Blindness effect.

Mobs that can sprint:

- Ocelots
- Cats
- Iron golems
- Wither skeletons
- Witches
- Wandering traders
- Endermen
- Villagers
- Vindicators
- Evokers
- Pillagers
- Camels

## Usage
Particles coming out of the ground while sprinting.
Sprinting allows the player to move at around 5.612 meters/second, which is 30 percent faster than the normal walking speed of around 4.317 m/s, jumping while sprinting allows the player to move with an average speed of 7.127 m/s. The player can turn while sprinting, resulting in slightly reduced speed. Sprinting also increases the speed of flying in Creative mode, and the speed of swimming. Although "sprinting" while mounted on a minecart, boat, horse, pig, or strider increases the field of vision like actual sprinting, it does not increase the entity's speed. 

While sprinting, it is possible to jump across up to four blocks horizontally,[1] instead of the usual two blocks, although sprinting does not cause the player to jump higher.

Sprinting reduces the player's saturation. When saturation reaches zero, the hunger bar depletes at a rate of 1⁄2 every 40 meters, or 7 seconds.

Sprinting produces particles at the player's feet corresponding to the block type they are running on. Also, when a player attacks any mob (excluding squid, iron golems and shulkers) while sprinting, the mob suffers a larger knockback than usual. Sprinting and holding down jump at the same time is usually faster, but actually becomes slower when under the effect of Speed II or higher.

Sprinting ends when the player collides with a solid block at an angle of greater than 8 degrees[note 1], sneaks, blocks or attacks a mob. Sprinting also ends if the hunger bar reduces to 6 () or less.

Sprinting pauses when the player eats food or drinks potions, but pressing sprint while eating food or potions does not start sprinting.

## Notes
1. ↑In the Bedrock version, there is a short window of time in which the player can move away from the solid block in order to continue sprinting. In the Java version, sprinting ends immediately upon colliding.
