#### Unit repair

Repair & NameDamaged Netherite Helmet
A netherite helmet can be repaired in an anvil by adding netherite ingots, with each ingot restoring 25% the helmet's maximum durability, rounded down. Two netherite helmets can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the helmet's enchantments.

## Usage
Helmets can be placed in the top armor slot of a player's inventory for activation.

### Defense points
Defense points are each signified by half of a shirt of mail in the armor bar above the health bar. Each defense point reduces any damage dealt to the player that is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.

Netherite helmet adds 3 () defense points.

### Knockback resistance
A netherite helmet provides 10% knockback resistance.

### Durability
Netherite helmet can absorb 407 damage before being destroyed.

Any "hit" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Damage taken that armor doesn't protect (such as falling or drowning) does not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits helmets can endure.

Netherite armor is not damaged by lava or fire when worn.

#### Repair
Netherite helmets may be repaired by using them along with some netherite ingots in an anvil. They may also be repaired by crafting them together with another netherite helmet.

### Enchantments
A helmet can receive the following enchantments.

### Armor trimming
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a netherite helmet, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, or diamond).


These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.
