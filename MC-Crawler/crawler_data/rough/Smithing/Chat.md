## Usage
By default, players can press T for keyboards,  for touchscreens,‌[BE & edu  only] or  for controllers‌[BE  only] to open the chat.

### Communication
The primary purpose of the chat is for player communication. Generally, the player simply types out their message and presses Enter.

If the player wishes to privately message another player, they can use the /msg command.

#### Mentioning
In Bedrock Edition, the at symbol (@) can be used to give a list of players in chat. When in a message the name is highlighted differently from the rest of chat. the color can be changed in chat settings. By default the defualt color is yellow.

#### Formatting
The section symbol (§) allows players to change the style of the text. See the list of formatting codes for further details. This does not work on vanilla clients due to the fact that the section symbol is restricted. 

In Bedrock Edition, certain emojis appear as icons in-game, such as the hunger and armor icons.[1] Other emojis and unknown characters appear as a question mark (?).

### Commands
Main article: Commands
Players can also type commands into the chat. Commands are identified by the use of a forward slash (/) at the beginning of the message. By default, the / key opens the chat with a / already present to easily run commands.

While typing, pressing TAB autocompletes the first possible command or username starting with the letter(s) typed. If there are multiple usernames or commands beginning with the letter(s), a list of possibilities is displayed; pressing  TAB  again scrolls through the list.

- Some commands may also have additional parameters that may be auto-completed by pressingTABat that point.
	- Certain commands that handle blocks (ex./fill) have parameters that need thecoordinatesof the target block(s). PressingTABwhen these coordinates are needed automatically adds the coordinates of the block the player is looking at.

## Message history
A player can access the message history via a small scroll bar is on the side of the chat bar. The player can also scroll using the mouse wheel or PgUp and PgDn. The last 100 chat messages are stored. Holding down LSHIFT or RSHIFT and attempting to scroll up or down slows down scrolling. The player can view their own recently sent messages by pressing the UP and DOWN keys while typing.

## Notes
- InJava Edition, the chat can be reduced in size, the opacity may be adjusted or it may be hidden via thechat settingsin the options menu. InBedrock Edition, the chat settings are found within the chat screen and include options to change the color of the chat, its font, and its size.
- InBedrock Edition, any inappropriate word or phrase typed in the chat is censored and replaced by number signs (#).
