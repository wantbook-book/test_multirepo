# Inventory
The inventory is the pop-up menu that the player uses to manage items they carry. From this screen a player can equip armor, craft items on a 2×2 grid, and equip tools, blocks, and items. The player's skin is also displayed here.

## Overview
The inventory is opened and closed by pressing E ( on the Xbox 360 & Xbox One,  on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation 4,  on the Wii U & Nintendo Switch, and ••• on mobile devices). This key can be changed from the in-game options menu. The inventory can also be closed with Esc ( on the Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch,  on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation 4, and × on mobile devices).

The inventory is saved upon exiting a world or server, so the player retains exactly the same items upon re-entering the world or server. 

### Slots
The inventory consists of 4 armor slots, 27 storage slots, 9 hotbar slots, and an off-hand slot. Items in the hotbar slots can be selected using the keyboard keys (1–9) or by scrolling through the mouse wheel. Pressing the F key moves the selected item to and from the hotbar slot and the off-hand slot.

Items can stack up to 64, 16, or not stack at all:

- Most items can stack to 64. This includes allblocks, and mostitems.
- Some other items, such assnowballs, emptybuckets,eggs,signs,hanging signs, andender pearls, can stack up to a maximum of 16.
- Some items do not stack at all, notably anything with adurability(weapons,armor, andtools), filledbuckets, andpotions.
- All items can technically be forced to stack up to 127 usingcommands, though not seen at all in-game.

In Survival or Adventure mode, there is also a 2×2 crafting grid, which allows any recipe that fits to be crafted but does not offer item storage.

Armor is considered equipped only when it is in an armor slot; when in any of the regular inventory slots, it is not considered "worn" and does not offer protection. Held armor can be equipped by using it, exchanging it with any armor already occupying that slot.

Items have tooltips if the cursor is hovered over them, displaying their name, enchantments, lore, and some item-specific information such as the version of a written book. Pressing F3 + H‌[JE  only] causes items to display additional information, such as their ID, data values, and some item specific information.

Pressing use on a block with an inventory, such as a chest, crafting table, or a furnace opens its GUI and allow items to be transferred between the 27 main slots, the 9 hotbar slots, and the block's GUI.

The only available slots for setting attributes are "mainhand", "offhand", "head", "chest", "legs", and "feet".

### Recipe book
Main article: Recipe book
The recipe book has a catalog of all the recipes in the game and serves as a crafting guide. It shows every crafting recipe that the player has had materials for.

Crafting recipes are organized into different categories in the recipe book through the different tabs. In Java Edition, the categories are:

- All recipes
- Tools,weapons, andarmor
- Building materials
- Foodand miscellaneous items
- Redstonecomponents

In Bedrock Edition, the categories are:

- Construction
- Equipment
- Items
- Nature
- Allrecipes

## Managing inventory
Stacks can be grabbed as a whole by pressing left-click on the stack and can be split in two by pressing right-click. If the stack is an odd quantity, then it leaves the smaller half behind (for example, a stack of 7 leaves 3 items in the slot and grabs 4). Conversely, holding a stack of items in the player's cursor and left-clicking in an inventory slot places the full stack into the slot, and right-clicking places items one at a time. Double-clicking an item grabs up to a full stack from all the items within the inventory.

Holding ⇧ Shift and clicking on the item sends the item from the player's hotbar to the player's 27 inventory slots, or vice versa. Doing so, while a block's inventory (chest, dispenser, etc.) is open, sends the item stack from the player's inventory into the block's inventory slot or vice versa. Holding Shift and double-clicking a stack moves all items of that kind between the player's inventory and the block, or their inventory and their hotbar. However, the player's cursor must already be holding an item (the type of item being held is not significant) for this to work. 

Hovering over an inventory slot and pressing 1–9 switches the item in that inventory slot with the item in that slot of the hotbar, or moves the item from one to the other if either slot is empty. In Java Edition, pressing F behaves similarly, but with the off-hand slot.

Dragging a stack of items with the cursor over an inventory using the left mouse button divides the stack equally over the dragged-over slots (with the remainder staying on the cursor), whereas dragging the stack around using the right mouse button places one item of that stack in each dragged-over slot. Regardless of which mouse button is used (left or right), this occurs only if the slot is empty or contains the same item being dragged.

In Creative mode, middle-clicking a slot in an inventory, grabs a full stack of the item while leaving the item in the slot. Dragging items with the cursor using the middle mouse button places a full stack of the item in each dragged-over slot.‌[Java Edition  only]

Pressing C+1–9 (hold down C while pressing 1-9) in Creative mode saves the current toolbar in the Saved Hotbars tab. It can be loaded with X+1-9.

Pressing drop while the cursor is hovering over a slot in the player's inventory or a container's inventory drops one item. Holding Ctrl and pressing drop while hovering over a slot in the player's inventory or container's inventory that has one or more items, drops the entire stack of items. While venturing without the full inventory open, the same can be applied for the selected item(s) from the hotbar. Items can also be dropped into the world by clicking outside the inventory window while holding an item with the cursor.

## Creative inventory
Main article: Creative inventory
Creative mode item selection screen (opened to the search tab)
In Creative mode, the inventory contains a block selection menu containing all blocks and items found in survival, plus a few additional items not obtainable in Survival. The blocks and items are organized into various tabs that differ slightly between Java and Bedrock.


## External inventories
Many blocks and some non-player entities have their own inventory-like windows that pop up to allow manipulation of items.

Note: Despite the fact that ender chest, crafting table, beacon, anvil, enchanting table, and villager inventories are actually internal behind the scenes, they are listed here as external because they require clicking on something external.
