## Natural regeneration
Natural healing can be deactivated using the command /gamerule naturalRegeneration false or from the world option.

### Hunger
Whenever a player's hunger is 18 ( × 9) or higher, they regenerate 1 every 4 seconds. This increases the player's exhaustion by 6, of which 4 cost 1 () hunger. If existing, the player's saturation is used up first.

### Saturation healing

  

This feature is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


If the player's hunger bar is completely filled and they have left over saturation, this saturation gets drained, healing at a rate of 2 every second. Just as with the hunger-based regeneration, every 1 regenerated deducts 1.5 saturation. With the maximum amount of 20 saturation, the player can rapidly regenerate up to 13 × 6.5.

### Peaceful difficulty
When the difficulty is set to Peaceful, the player regenerates at a standard rate of 1 per second, additionally with 1 every 4 seconds as the player's hunger bar is filled. Chorus fruit, golden apples, honey bottles, and suspicious stew can be eaten even when the hunger bar is full, increasing the player's regeneration even further. On the other hand, this also causes the player to lose saturation even when changing from other difficulty levels to Peaceful mode.

## Artificial regeneration
### Potions
The player can drink a potion to regain health immediately or over time.

#### Potion of Healing
The potion of Healing instantly regenerates 4. If it gets amplified with glowstone, this value increases to 8. In the upcoming Combat Tests, it instantly heals 6 per level.

It can also be turned into a lingering potion that heals up to 10 when the player is inside an area effect. Glowstone amplifies healing up to 20 × 10.

#### Potion of Regeneration
The potion of Regeneration heals 1 every 2.5 seconds over 45 seconds, resulting in 18 × 9 in total. Amplifying the potion with glowstone increases this rate to 1 every 1.25 seconds for 0:22 seconds, whereas redstone increases the duration to 1:30‌[JE  only]/2:00‌[BE  only] minutes, restores 36 × 18‌[JE  only] / 48 × 24‌[BE  only]

In Bedrock Edition Adding gunpowder to make splash potion decreases its duration, making healing less effective. Splash potion of regeneration heals 1 every 2.5 seconds over 33 seconds, resulting in 13 × 6.5 in total. Amplifying the potion with glowstone increases this rate to 1 every 1.25 seconds for 0:16 seconds, whereas redstone increases the duration to 1:30 minutes, restores 36 × 18.

Adding Dragon Breath on splash potion to make lingering potion. Lingering potion of regeneration heals 1 every 2.5 seconds over 11 seconds, resulting in 4 in total. Amplifying the potion with glowstone increases this rate to 1 every 1.25 seconds for 0.5 seconds, whereas redstone increases the duration to 0:22‌[JE  only] / 0:30‌[BE  only] seconds, restores 8‌[JE  only]12 × 6‌[BE  only].

#### Tipped arrow
Tipped arrow shots from a bow, crossbow, or dispenser inflict arrow damage and a status effect. Arrows of healing give the same effect as its potion (4 for an arrow of healing I, and 8 for an arrow of healing II). Regeneration I arrows last 5 seconds (restores 2), the extended regeneration I arrows last 0:11‌[JE  only] / 0:15‌[BE  only] seconds (restores 4‌[JE  only] / 6‌[BE  only]), and arrows of regeneration II give regeneration II for 0:02 seconds (restores 2). However, arrow damage decreases or sometimes even nullifies the health recovered unless a weak bow shot is used or the player is wearing good armor.

### Golden apple
Main article: Golden apple
A golden apple can heal the player in different ways:

- Both golden apples refill4 ()hunger.
- They provide 9.6 saturation, which can be drained for 6quickly if the player's hunger bar is filled.
- Similar to a potion, a golden apple provides theRegenerationstatus effect. A normal golden apple gives Regeneration II for 5 seconds, and an enchanted golden apple for 20 seconds, resulting in 4regenerated from a normal golden apple and 16× 8from an enchanted one. InBedrock Edition, enchanted apple gives regeneration V for 30 seconds, which enough to recover full health in a few seconds. The enchanted golden apple also gives the status effectsFire ResistanceandResistancefor 5 minutes.

### Beacon
When a beacon is upgraded to the highest level, it can be configured to provide the Regeneration status effect. As long as a player is within the radius of such a beacon, they regenerate 1 every 2.5 seconds.

### Axolotl
During a fight, axolotls can give players Regeneration I for 5 seconds, restoring 2 per axolotl, for up to 2 minutes.‌[Java Edition  only]

## Mob healing
In contrast to the player, most mobs don't heal by themselves. Nevertheless, there are several ways to heal animals and monsters.

### Potions
Most mobs are healed by potions of Healing and Regeneration just like the player.

On the other hand, undead mobs take damage from these potions, and healing them requires a potion of Harming. Potions of Regeneration or Poison don't affect undead mobs at all.

### Regeneration
Rideable animals like horses, donkeys, mules, skeleton horses and llamas automatically regenerate at a slow rate of about 2 per minute.

### Axolotl
Axolotls may play dead when taking damage underwater, dropping to the ground for 10 seconds while regenerating.

### Spider
In Java Edition, spiders on Hard difficulty can spawn with permanent positive status effects, which can include Regeneration, making the spider gradually recover health.

### Villager
Villagers gain 10 seconds of regeneration when new trades are unlocked. 
Additionally in Bedrock Edition, villagers recover health when waking up from bed every morning.

### Iron golem
Iron golems can be healed using iron ingots by right-clicking on them, restoring their health by 25 × 12.5. This cannot be done using iron nuggets or iron blocks.

### Witch
Witches use potions of Healing to heal themselves. 
Additionally, witches throw splash potions of Healing or Regeneration at illagers during raids.‌[Java Edition  only]

### Feeding
Some animals can also be fed in order to recover a set amount of hitpoints. The following animals can be fed:

| Animal                    | Maximum Health   | Food                                                        | Healing                       |

Feeding wolf pups not only restores lost health but can also increase their total health from the usual 8 up to a maximum of 20 × 10.

### Boss healing
#### Ender dragon
The ender dragon gets healed by the end crystals on the obsidian pillars in the End. If a crystal gets destroyed during the healing phase, though, the dragon takes 10             (5 hearts) damage instead.

#### Wither
The wither permanently regenerates its health. If an undead mob (including a wither) gets hit by a blue wither skull, they also get healed by the provided Wither effect.
