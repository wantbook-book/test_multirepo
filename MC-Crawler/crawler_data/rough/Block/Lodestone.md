## Obtaining
### Breaking
Lodestone requires a pickaxe to be mined, in which case it drops itself. If mined without a pickaxe, then the mining is slower and it drops nothing.

## Usage
### Lodestone Compass
Using a compass on a lodestone causes the compass to point to the lodestone, indicated by an enchantment glint effect on the compass. This works even in the End and the Nether. If the lodestone is broken, or in a different dimension, then the compass spins randomly, as ordinary compasses in the End and Nether do. If the lodestone is destroyed while a paired compass is in a chest, shulker box, item frame, armor stand, or any other storage item, the compass does not register that the lodestone is destroyed until the item is retrieved. Placing a lodestone back in the exact place as the original lodestone while the compass is still in a container prevents unpairing.

### Piston interactivity
Lodestones cannot be pushed by pistons or pulled by sticky pistons.
