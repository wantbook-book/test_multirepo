### Stripping
Using an axe on a block of bamboo turns it into a block of stripped bamboo.

### Fuel
Blocks of bamboo can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.

The efficiency of using bamboo as fuel depends on how it is crafted. 9 bamboo can smelt 2.25 items, whereas a block can smelt only 1.5 items. However, the block can be crafted into 2 bamboo planks, which together can smelt 3 items.

Unlike logs, blocks of bamboo cannot be smelted into charcoal.[1]

### Note blocks
Block of bamboo can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sounds.
