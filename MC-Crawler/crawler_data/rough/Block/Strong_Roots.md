## Obtaining
### Breaking
Strong roots have no assigned tool, meaning they are mined at the same speed regardless of the tool used. Strong roots never drop as an item when mined, even with Silk Touch.

| Block    | Strong Roots        |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 0.4                 |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.6                 |

### Natural generation
Strong roots generate in potato villages.

### Post-generation
Powerful potatoes grow strong roots out of its sides and downward.

## Usage
If strong roots are connected to a powerful potato, they attempt to grow horizontally or downward (they never grow upward). Every block that is replaced by strong roots gets dropped on top of the powerful potato they are connected with. The block drops as it was mined with a proper tool - usually enchanted with Fortune I, but sometimes enchanted with Silk Touch.[more information needed].

Strong roots can replace barriers, end portal block, command blocks and most other blocks in game. Exceptions include: other powerful potatoes, bedrock, end portal frames, monster spawners, and reinforced deepslate.[more information needed]

### Piston interactivity
Strong roots are destroyed when pushed by pistons. They do not stick to sticky pistons, slime blocks or honey blocks.
