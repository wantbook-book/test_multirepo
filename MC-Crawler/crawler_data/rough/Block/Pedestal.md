## Obtaining
Pedestals are not obtainable in Survival, even with Silk Touch, and are only available through the Creative inventory or commands. They are highly blast resistant and have the same hardness as reinforced deepslate.

### Breaking
Pedestals have no assigned tool, meaning they are mined at the same speed regardless of the tool used. A pedestal never drops as an item when mined.

| Block    | Pedestal            |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 55                  |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 82.5                |

### Natural generation
Pedestals can generate naturally in ruined portatols, in villages both in the Overworld and in Potato dimension, at the center of end portals in strongholds, and in colosseums.

## Usage
### Potato portals
When a poisonous potato is used on a pedestal, a potato portal is spawned above the pedestal.

### Piston interactivity
Pedestals cannot be pushed or pulled by pistons. They can, however, be moved by floataters.
