## Obtaining
### Breaking
A big brain can be broken using anything, but an axe is the fastest. Big brains always drop themselves and a potato of knowledge when mined.

## Usage
### Potatoes of knowledge
Big brains absorb nearby experience orbs. When broken, a big brain drops a potato of knowledge with a knowledge amount equal to how much experience it absorbed (if it didn't absorb anything, potato of knowledge still drops, with 0 knowledge). Maximum possible amount stored in a single potato of knowledge is equal to 1000 experience points; if big brain absorbs this much experience, a potato of knowledge with 1000 experience is dropped by it automatically, without breaking the block.

### Piston interactivity
Big brains cannot be pushed or pulled by pistons.

### Note blocks
Big brains can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sounds.
