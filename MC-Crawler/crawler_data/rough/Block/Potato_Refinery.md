### Breaking
Potato refineries have no assigned tool and never drop as an item, even with Silk Touch.

## Usage
### Refining
The interface in-game
A potato refinery has four slots: a fuel slot, two item slots, and an output slot. In the fuel slot, up to a stack of any fuel can be placed. The two item slots can hold up to a stack of any item.

Like furnaces, different types of fuel smelt a different number of items. If the refinery is not currently using a piece of fuel and is ready to refine, a new piece of fuel is used.

#### Oil extraction
If the refinery has fuel, nothing in the output slot, a potato in the first item slot, and at least one empty glass bottle in the second item slot, the refining process begins. After 100 game ticks (5 seconds), a potato and glass bottle are used, and a bottle of potato oil is produced. If a poisonous potato was used in the first item slot, a bottle of poisonous potato oil is created.

#### Lubrication
If the refinery has fuel, nothing in the output slot, a bottle of regular (non-poisonous) potato oil in the first item slot, and any item in the second item slot, the refinery is activated. After 125 game ticks (6.25 seconds), the bottle of potato oil and the item are used. The output is an item with a lubrication factor. The higher the lubrication factor, the more the item slides around when on the ground. An item can be lubricated multiple times, but with diminishing returns.

### Piston interactivity
Potato refineries cannot be pushed or pulled by pistons.

### Note blocks
Potato refineries can be placed under note blocks to produce "base drum" sounds.
