## Nighttime
Main article: Daylight cycle
Nighttime begins after the sun has fully set in the west and the moon has risen in the east. As time passes, the moon moves westward across the sky. Overall, nighttime lasts about 7 minutes (in real-time). Players can track the moon's position in the sky using a clock.

During the night, the moon illuminates the surface in the same manner as the sun; however, light levels fall to a minimum of four.

Grass blocks and saplings do not grow in moonlight, nor do they decay. To grow them at night requires the use of light sources such as torches. On the other hand, crops continue to grow.

Nighttime can be skipped entirely using a bed, provided there are no monsters nearby.

### Stars
Together with the moon, the night sky also consists of stars. Stars appear as bright points, and the starfield rotates with the moon, rising in the east and descending in the west, as the night progresses.

## Phases
The full moon phase.
The Moon is always opposite of the Sun, but still goes through eight lunar phases, and changes phase at the end of every sunrise. This allows the player to keep rough track of the passage of time, even after spending a few game days underground.

The phases of the moon are (in chronological order as they appear in-game):

1. Full moon
2. Waning gibbous
3. Last quarter
4. Waning crescent
5. New moon
6. Waxing crescent
7. First quarter
8. Waxing gibbous

The pixels of the first quarter phase moon and waxing gibbous moon presents a more rounded, organic shape than the corresponding waning phase moons that present a more squared-off appearance. This can help a player in timing a slime hunt in a swamp (see below).

There is no explicit command to change the moon's phase, but using /time add 24000 advances time by one day toward the next phase. To go back one phase, using /time add 168000 advances time by 7 days, which is one full lunar cycle minus one moon phase.

There is an equation to calculate the moon phase on any given day in Minecraft: phase = (day mod 8) + 1. The day can be found in the F3 screen, and the phase matches to the list shown above.

Slimes spawning in a swamp during the full moon (view of eastern sky; moon rising)
The phase of the moon has three subtle effects on mob spawning:

- The number ofslimesthat spawn inswampsis proportional to the moon's fullness: They are most numerous during the full moon and none spawn during the new moon. (The moon's phase does not influence the normal spawning of slimes in designated chunks ataltitudesbelow y=40.)
- The fuller the moon, the higher the chanceskeletonsandzombieshave the ability to pick up items and spawn with weapons and armor. Furthermore, there is a higher chance for their equipment to beenchanted, and if it is, the enchantment levels are higher.  A fuller moon also givesspidersa greater chance to spawn with random beneficialstatus effects, including invisibility‌[Java Edition  only]. All of these effects combine with the world'sdifficulty, and higher difficulty levels increase the chance of mob buffs.
- During a full moon, 50% ofcatsspawn as black.
