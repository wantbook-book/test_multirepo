## Daytime
Main article: Daylight cycle
Example of the sun rising on the horizon.
The sun and moon rise in the east and set in the west.

When the player creates a new world, the time is set to dawn and the sun starts on the horizon. As time passes, it slowly moves across the sky. As the sun sets, the moon rises. Overall, daytime lasts 10 minutes (in real-time).

## Sunlight
Sunlight refers to the light, particularly sky light, which illuminates all blocks directly below the sky, and which do not have a shadow cast over them by an opaque block or by inclement weather. Clouds themselves do not cast shadows; however, during inclement weather (rain and snow), the sky darkens and reduces the amount of sunlight in the world. During these storms, the ambient light value during the day is reduced to 12 from the usual 15, and in thunderstorms the light level is reduced to 10 although treated as 0, allowing hostile mobs to spawn.

When the sun rises and sets, blocks exposed to sunlight change their light level depending on the angle of the sun, giving the effect of gradually getting lighter at dawn and gradually getting darker at dusk. However, shadows of blocks are not affected by the position of the sun in the sky, making sundials impossible.

Illumination decreases with depth underground until ultimately there is no illumination all. A gap or a vertical shaft in the ceiling of a cavern allows sunlight to filter in.

Sunlight can be used to turn dirt blocks into grass blocks, as long as there is an illuminated grass block adjacent to the dirt. Grass blocks spread quickest when exposed to sunlight at the high-point of the day (time 6000).

### Effects on mobs
Some hostile undead mobs, such as zombies, burn up in sunlight.
Sunlight affects how certain mobs spawn.

Except for bats, which require light level 4 or lower to spawn, passive mobs require a minimum light level of 9 (in Java Edition) or 12 (mooshrooms, polar bears, and rabbits in Bedrock Edition) or 7 (all other land animals in Bedrock Edition) to spawn; therefore, they do not spawn at night.

Hostile mobs, in contrast, do not spawn in sky light level 1 or above (See: Spawn#Spawn_cycle). Skeletons, zombies, zombie villagers, strays, drowned and phantoms are set on fire for 160 ticks upon entering an area fully illuminated by sunlight, and they try to avoid such areas. They do not burn while in water, in the rain, wearing a helmet, or in the shade. Spiders become neutral while in direct sunlight, until attacked by the player. Endermen teleport away from players in sunlight. All other hostile mobs, such as creepers, slimes, and silverfish, are completely unaffected by sunlight.

Boss mobs do not take damage from sunlight; they spawn regardless of the light level.
