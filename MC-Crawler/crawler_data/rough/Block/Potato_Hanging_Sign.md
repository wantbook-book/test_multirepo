This tag is automatically set to""for lines containing blocked words and to the line's normal contents for the other lines when a player with the profanity filter turnedoffedits the sign, so players with the filteroncannot see the blocked words. If a player with the filterontries to use blocked words in one or more lines, the line(s) inmessagescontaining blocked words are set to"", which makes them render completely blank, and this tag is also given the same contents. If multiple lines have been edited before the sign editing GUI is closed, only the lines containing blocked words are blanked.
