# Target
A target is a block that produces a temporary redstone signal when hit by a projectile. Unlike most other conductive blocks, it also redirects adjacent redstone dust toward it.

## Obtaining
### Breaking
Targets can be mined using any tool or by hand, but a hoe is the fastest way to break it.

1. ↑Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

### Natural generation
A target can be found in ancient cities.

## Usage
Targets emit a redstone signal when hit by most projectiles. This includes arrows, tridents, eggs, snowballs, splash potions, fire charges fired by a dispenser, firework rockets, lingering potions, bottles o' enchanting, ender pearls, shulker bullets, flying players[1], and llama spit. The closer a projectile is to the center of the block, the stronger the redstone signal that is produced.

### Redstone component
Targets redirecting redstone toward themselves
When struck by most projectiles, the target emits redstone power for 4 redstone ticks (0.4 seconds). Arrows and tridents instead cause the target to emit power for 10 redstone ticks (1 second), similar to stone buttons. A target can be hit with any of the projectiles mentioned above.

The strength of the signal depends on how close the projectile is to the center of the block, from 1 to 15.

In Java Edition, the target also provides a block update when hit, meaning that an observer can detect if the target has been hit and has produced a redstone signal.[2]

When used as part of a redstone circuit, a target has the unique property that, though being an opaque block that is not a mechanism component, still can redirect adjacent redstone dust to point to itself.

## Data values
### ID
Java Edition:

| Name   | Identifier | Form         | Translation key          |
|--------|------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Target | `target`   | Block & Item | `block.minecraft.target` |

Bedrock Edition:

| Name   | Identifier | Numeric ID | Form                       | Item ID[i 1]   | Translation key    |
|--------|------------|------------|----------------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Target | `target`   | `494`      | Block & Giveable Item[i 2] | Identical[i 3] | `tile.target.name` |

1. ↑ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.
2. ↑Available with /give command.
3. ↑The block's direct item form has the same id as the block.

### Block states
Java Edition:

| Name  | Default value | Allowed values                                                                                                                    | Description                          |
