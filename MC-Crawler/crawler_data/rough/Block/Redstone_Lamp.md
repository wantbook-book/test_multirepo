## Usage
A redstone lamp can be used to produce switchable light. 

Redstone lamps are redstone mechanisms and can be activated by:

- An adjacent activepower component, including above or below: for example, aredstone torch(except that a redstone torch does not activate a redstone lamp it is attached to), ablock of redstone, adaylight sensor, etc.
- An adjacentpowered block(for example, an opaque block with an active redstone torch under it), including above or below
- A poweredredstone comparatororredstone repeaterfacing the redstone lamp
- Adjacent poweredredstone dustconfigured to point at the redstone lamp (or on top of it) or directionless; a redstone lamp isnotactivated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is configured to point away from it.

A redstone lamp activates instantly, but takes 2 redstone ticks to turn off (4 game ticks, or 0.2 seconds barring lag) in Java Edition or 3 redstone ticks to turn off (6 game ticks, or 0.3 seconds barring lag) in Bedrock Edition.

An active redstone lamp produces block light 15. An inactive redstone lamp produces no light.

A redstone lamp acts like an opaque block; it blocks sky light, mobs suffocate in it, and it conducts redstone power. It also allows mobs to spawn on them while it is unlit.
