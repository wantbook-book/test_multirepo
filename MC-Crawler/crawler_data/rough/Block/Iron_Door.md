# Iron Door
An iron door is a variant of the door made of iron that can only be opened using redstone. Iron doors are more secure than wooden doors because they cannot be opened by hand and cannot be broken by zombies. They are also more resistant to explosions, and immune to fire and lava.

Iron doors require a solid block beneath them for support. if that block is no longer supporting, due to breaking or changing, the door will drop itself as an item.

Pistons can also break doors, pushing the piston head or any block into the door causes the door to break.

An iron door can be broken with anything if the top half of the door is broken.[1][2]
