# Big Sign
A big sign was a three block wide version of a sign. It was obtainable in MinecraftEdu by placing a sign and selecting the Big sign option in the GUI.

## Usage
The big sign functioned effectively the same as a regular sign, however the model was stretched to the width of three blocks. The big sign allowed for more characters to be included per line, due to the increased width.
