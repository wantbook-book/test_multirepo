## Blocks
Only few blocks can exhibit true animations. While many blocks have states that can be changed via interactions or otherwise, these are usually instantaneous flips with no continuous transformation between them. Examples of blocks capable of animation include:

- Chests,trapped chestsandender chests, whose lids are on a hinge and which open and close
- Shulker boxes, when opened or closed
- Pistonsandsticky pistons, alongside any attached blocks, when expanding or contracting
- Conduits, when active
- Enchanting tablebooks

## Fluids
Both fluids in the game (water and lava) are animated in all forms and directions.

## Entities
Almost all entities have animations of some sort, ranging from an idle animation which always plays to attacking animations and even dancing. Mobs also have walking or other fitting animations when moving.
