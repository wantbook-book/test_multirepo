## Obtaining
### Breaking
A block of amethyst can be obtained by mining it with any pickaxe. When mined using any other tool, it drops nothing.

### Natural generation
Blocks of amethyst generate naturally on the inner wall of amethyst geodes, with calcite and smooth basalt making up next two outer layers.

## Usage
### Sound
Uniquely among other blocks, a block of amethyst makes a quiet overlay sound when generally interacted with, as well as its block breaking sound when hit with a projectile.

### Vibration resonance
When a block of amethyst is placed adjacent to a sculk sensor or a calibrated sculk sensor, if that sculk sensor receives a vibration, the block of amethyst re-emits its frequency as a separate vibration at its location. This vibration can then be detected by another sculk sensor, allowing a chain of sculk sensors and amethyst blocks to be created, transmitting a signal wirelessly.
