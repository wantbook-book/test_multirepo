## Usage
### Farming
See also: Tutorials/Pumpkin and melon farming

Pumpkin seeds can be planted only on farmland, as stems. Over time, a stem grows through several stages and, at its final growth stage, produces pumpkins on any adjacent dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, grass block, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss block, mud or muddy mangrove roots. If a pumpkin is already occupying a spot adjacent to a stem it does not grow more pumpkins until the pumpkin is removed. A single stem can grow an unlimited number of pumpkins. Pumpkin stems need a minimum light level of 10 in the block above the stem to grow and give pumpkins. Pumpkin seeds are affected by bone meal only with respect to stem growth; bone meal does not help produce the actual pumpkins.

### Breeding
Like other seeds, pumpkin seeds can be used to breed chickens, lead chickens around, and make baby chickens grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.

### Taming
Like other seeds, pumpkin seeds can be used to tame parrots.

### Composting
Placing pumpkin seeds into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

## Pumpkin stem
A pumpkin stem is the block that is planted on farmland when pumpkin seeds are used on it. It starts underground, and rises up as the plant grows. The stem is colored green when young, and then yellow once fully grown.

The stem curves once a pumpkin has grown from it. A fully-grown single stem connects to any pumpkin in an adjacent square, thus there are 5 possible appearances to a stem. If there are multiple pumpkins it can connect to, it favors the east, then west, north, and south. When the pumpkin is removed, the stem returns to its straight shape.
