## Obtaining
### Breaking
Cobblestone can be mined using a pickaxe, in which case it drops itself. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. Its hardness is greater than stone so it requires more time to break, especially with anything other than a pickaxe.

| Block     | Cobblestone           |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| Hardness  | 2                     |
| Tool      |                       |
|           | Breakingtime (sec)[A] |
| Default   | 10                    |
| Wooden    | 1.5                   |
| Stone     | 0.75                  |
| Iron      | 0.5                   |
| Diamond   | 0.4                   |
| Netherite | 0.35                  |
| Golden    | 0.25                  |

1. ↑Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

Cobblestone is dropped by stone when mined without Silk Touch, and also by infested cobblestone when mined with Silk Touch. 

### Natural generation
Cobblestone occurs naturally in monster rooms, jungle pyramids, pillager outposts, ocean ruins, strongholds, plains, taiga and snowy plains villages, woodland mansions, and trail ruins.

In Java Edition, a single block of cobblestone always generates at the coordinates of (8, -61, 8) at the center of the void start platform, in Superflat worlds created with the Void biome preset.


### Post-generation
See also: Tutorials/Cobblestone farming

When water and flowing lava come into contact, the flowing lava is replaced by cobblestone. However, if the lava flows on top of the water from above, stone is created instead. Non-flowing lava (a lava source block) turns into obsidian upon contact with water, thus the requirement of flowing lava.

## Usage
Cobblestone can be used as basic building block, as it has relatively high blast resistance and is extremely common.

### Silverfish
Silverfish can enter and hide in cobblestone, creating an infested block.
