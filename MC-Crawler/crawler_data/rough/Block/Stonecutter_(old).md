# Stonecutter (old)
The stonecutter is an unused decorative block. It was previously used to craft many stone items in Bedrock Edition until those recipes were moved to the crafting table. It was later replaced by a new stonecutter in the Creative inventory, but it still exists in old worlds which had one.

## Obtaining
Old stonecutters are only available by using third-party software or by pick blocking an existing stonecutter in an old world. In New Nintendo 3DS Edition, they are available in the Creative inventory.

### Breaking
An old stonecutter requires a pickaxe to be mined, in which case it drops itself. If mined without a pickaxe, then the mining is slower and it drops nothing.
