## Obtaining
### Breaking
See also: Fortune § Discrete random

A sea lantern can be obtained only when mined with a tool enchanted with Silk Touch. When broken using anything other than a Silk Touch enchanted tool, it drops 2–3 prismarine crystals. The Fortune enchantment increases the number of prismarine crystals dropped. This method of obtaining sea lanterns is wasteful though; the 4 prismarine shards and up to 3 of the prismarine crystals used to craft it are non-retrievable.

| Block    | Sea Lantern         |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 0.3                 |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.45                |

Each level of Fortune increases the maximum number of prismarine crystals dropped. The amount is capped at 5, so Fortune III simply increases the chance of getting 5 crystals.

### Natural generation
Sea lanterns generate throughout ocean monuments, as well as in some ocean ruins.

## Usage
### Light source
Sea lanterns emit a light level of 15, the brightest possible light level in the game.

### Conduit power
Main article: Conduit
Sea lanterns can be used to activate a conduit by building a structure around it. By doing this, the conduit emits the Conduit Power effect in a certain radius, depending on how many blocks are used to power it. Prismarine, dark prismarine, and prismarine bricks can also be used for this purpose.

### Note Blocks
Sea lanterns can be placed under note blocks to produce "Clicks and Sticks" sound.

### Transparent block
The Sea lantern blocks all sunlight, players and mobs suffocate inside it, and it blocks a Beacon beam, preventing the Beacon's activation. However, like transparent blocks, it does not prevent the opening of chests, monsters (including Slimes) cannot spawn on it, and it does not transfer a redstone signal. This behavior also occurs in Glowstone.
