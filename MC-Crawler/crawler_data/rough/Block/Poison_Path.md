## Obtaining
### Breaking
When mined (even with a Silk Touch tool), poison path drops only terre de pomme. It can be obtained in item form only via Creative inventory, commands, or pick block.

1. ↑Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

### Natural generation
Poison path generates in fields and arboretum biomes, as well as in potato villages.

### Post-generation
Using a shovel on terre de pomme, peelgrass block, or corrupted peelgrass block converts it to poison path.

## Usage
Poison path is primarily a decoration block, like normal dirt path. They are only 15⁄16 of a block high, therefore items that require a full block like torches and buttons cannot be placed on them, and mobs cannot spawn on them.

Poison path converts to terre de pomme instantly if a solid block is placed on top of it.

Using a hoe on poison path converts it to poison farmland.
