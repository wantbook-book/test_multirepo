## Obtaining
### Breaking
A flower can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself. A flower also breaks if water runs over its location, or if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location.

### Natural generation
See also: Vegetation

Most flowers generate naturally on dirt and grass blocks as part of vegetation features in most biomes. Flowers can generate even if the biome is covered with snow. The tables in § Flower biomes show the types of small flowers that can naturally spawn in each biome when a new chunk is generated, as well as the flowers that can spawn when bone meal is used on grass blocks.

Sunflowers generate in sunflower plains; lilacs, rose bushes, and peonies can be found in forests, flower forests, birch forests, old growth birch forests, and dark forests.

Wither roses, torchflowers and pitcher plants do not generate naturally at all.

Natural dandelions are found in plains and savanna villages; poppies in plains, savanna, taiga, and snowy plains‌[BE  only] villages; oxeye daisies, cornflowers, and azure bluets in plains villages. Potted dandelions, poppies, blue orchids, alliums, azure bluets, red and white tulips, and oxeye daisies can be found in woodland mansions.

### Flower biomes
Flowers marked "Natural generation only" can only spawn when the chunk is initially generated, not when using bone meal; flowers marked "Bone meal only" cannot generate naturally, but can be created by players using bone meal on a grass block in that biome (§ Post-generation for more details).

Dandelions and poppies in jungles, bamboo jungles, sparse jungles, savannas and savanna plateaus (but not windswept savanna) are twice as common as in other biomes.

Some biomes - such as deserts - are technically enabled to generate vegetation features containing flowers, but do not generate dirt or grass blocks on the surface in regular worlds. This means that flowers are normally not generated in these biomes in regular worlds. Flowers can still be grown in these biomes by using bone meal on grass blocks, and they can generate naturally if a dirt or grass block surface is provided in custom superflats or custom worlds.

1. ↑ a bThis biome is technically enabled to generate flower vegetation features, but they normally fail to generate due to the lack of grass blocks on the surface. Players can still grow flowers using bone meal.
2. ↑ a bThis includes biomes - such as desert - that are technically enabled to generate flower vegetation features, but lack grass blocks on the surface in normal worlds. Players can still grow flowers there using bone meal.
3. ↑Generates as part of the flower gradient, and separately as part of "forest flower" patches. Can be grown with bone meal only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient.

### Flower gradients
In some biomes, the placement of flowers is determined by gradients. These are not affected by the world seed. In Java Edition, gradients are three dimensional and change on the Y level, while in Bedrock Edition they are consistent at every height.

#### Flower forests
In a flower forest, any given coordinate can spawn only one type of flower, resulting in a gradient (pictured below). The gradient runs as follows:

- Dandelion‌[Java Edition  only]
- Poppy
- Allium
- Azure bluet
- Red tulip
- Orange tulip
- White tulip
- Pink tulip
- Oxeye daisy
- Cornflower
- Lily of the valley

In Bedrock Edition, additional randomness is applied during terrain generation, meaning that some flowers might not perfectly align to the gradient.

Peonies, lilacs, and rose bushes generate independently from the gradient. In Java Edition, additional patches of lily of the valley are generated by a separate flower feature that does not follow the gradient and that cannot be regrown using bone meal.[1]

- Flower forest gradient in Java Edition
- Flower forest gradient in Bedrock Edition
- An example of how elevation affects the flower forest gradient in Java Edition

#### Meadows
In meadows, up to 3 gradients intersect and overlap to create complex patterns. Like in flower forests, any given coordinate can spawn only one type of flower. In Java Edition, the individual gradients run as follows:

- Tall grass
- Allium
- Poppy
- Azure bluet
- Dandelion
- Cornflower
- Oxeye daisy
- Short grass

Using bone meal in areas of the gradient where only tall grass or short grass generate does not create any flower.

In Bedrock Edition, the gradients only affect naturally generated vegetation; bone meal completely ignores the gradients and only generates dandelions. The individual gradients run as follows:

- Allium
- Poppy
- Cornflower
- Oxeye daisy
- Azure bluet
- Dandelion
- Short grass
- Nothing

- Meadow flower gradient

#### Plains
Plains and sunflower plains use a simpler gradient that allows tulips to generate only in rare areas where no other kinds of flower can spawn. Flower types are otherwise selected randomly: dandelions, poppies, azure bluets, oxeye daisies, and cornflowers outside the tulip areas (with dandelions being more common than the others), and any type of tulip inside the tulip areas. Sunflowers in sunflower plains generate independently from the gradient.

In Java Edition, this pattern is also applied to dripstone caves and the deep dark, although flowers do not naturally generate there.

- Tulips grown using bone meal in a dripstone cave in Java Edition.

### Post-generation
See also: Tutorials/Flower farming

When bone meal is applied to a grass block, flowers have a chance of generating instead of short grass on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area in Java Edition, or a 7×5×7 area in Bedrock Edition. In most biomes, the generated flower is picked randomly among all possible choices depending on the biome (see § Flower biomes for a chart of flowers that can be grown in each biome). In a few biomes, however, a gradient is applied and the generated flower additionally depends on the X/Y/Z coordinates.

Double flowers, wither roses and torchflowers cannot be obtained this way.

In Bedrock Edition, when bone meal is applied to a small flower (except wither rose and torchflower) that has been placed or generated on top of a grass block, more flowers appear around it without short grass. With the exception of dandelions and poppies, the flowers that form around are the same type as the original flower. In the case of dandelions, poppies occasionally appear, and vice versa for poppies. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.

Applying bone meal to a double flower (except pitcher plants) results in the flower dropping a copy of itself. This is the only renewable way to obtain double flowers.

### Mob loot
Endermen can pick up small flowers, and drop one if killed while holding it.

Iron golems drop 0–2 poppies on death.

### Trading
Wandering traders may sell any small flower except wither roses and torchflowers for a single emerald.

## Usage
All of the blocks that flowers can be placed on. Dandelions represent small flowers, rose bushes represent large flowers, and wither roses represent additional blocks they can be placed on.
All kinds of flowers can be used as decoration and planted on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss blocks, mud, or muddy mangrove roots. Wither roses can also be planted on netherrack or soul sand. In Java Edition, wither roses can also be planted on soul soil. One-block-tall flowers can be planted in a flower pot.

All flowers can be crafted into dyes, and all small flowers can be used to craft suspicious stew.

Because flowers are non-solid transparent blocks, they can be used (like torches) to break blocks that fall on them, such as sand.

### Suspicious stew
Main article: Suspicious Stew
All small flowers can be used to create suspicious stew. When a flower is used on a brown mooshroom, the brown mooshroom produces a suspicious stew related to that flower the next time it is milked with a bowl. The mooshroom returns to producing regular mushroom stew until fed another flower. Eating one bowl of suspicious stew restores 6 () hunger and 7.2 hunger saturation, as well as producing a brief status effect.

| Ingredients                                                     | Crafting recipe |

Using different flowers results in different effects. All are short-lived, but some have lasting effects: The regeneration restores 2 or 3 health; Wither or poison inflicts up to 2 hearts damage. The saturation effectively makes those stews a superfood: they restore up to 6 hunger and 12 saturation points on top of their food value, for a total of 12 ( × 6) and over 19 points of saturation.

### Bees
Bees engage in a pollinating behavior with flowers, increasing the honey level in beehives and bee nests by 1. Bees attempt to pollinate wither roses, although they get damaged in the process.[2] In Bedrock Edition, bees ignore snowlogged flowers.[3]

### Breeding
Any flower can be used for bees, including wither roses.[4]

### Bee nests
Oak, birch, and cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of any flower have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest and 1-3 bees in it.

### Composting
Placing any flower (except for the torchflower or a pitcher plant) into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of flowers yields an average of 5.94 bone meal.

Placing a torchflower or a pitcher plant into a composter has a 85% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
