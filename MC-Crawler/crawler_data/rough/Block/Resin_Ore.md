## Obtaining
### Breaking
Resin ore must be mined with a hoe, otherwise it drops nothing.

Breaking resin ore drops one toxic resin, unless mined with a Silk Touch hoe. Toxic resin obtained from resin ore always has "air bubbles" impurities, and either "abysmal", "clouded", or "eventual" clarity. Resin ore is affected by Fortune enchantment, dropping an average of 1.33 toxic resins with level I, 1.75 toxic resins with level II, and 2.2 toxic resins with level III. All resins dropped from a single ore block always are of the same clarity.
