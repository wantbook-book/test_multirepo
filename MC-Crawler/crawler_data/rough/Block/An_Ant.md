## Obtaining
An ant cannot be obtained as an item even by using the /give command. An ant can be placed using commands such as /fill or /setblock, and naturally generates in the "ant" dimension. It cannot be mined or exploded.

### Natural generation
One ant block naturally generates in the "ant" dimension, where it begins moving immediately.

## Usage
An ant simulates Langton's ant. If placed on top of black or white concrete, it moves in a deterministic pattern, turning the concrete underneath it into its other variation. The ant block is the Turing machine mentioned in the update's changelog.

If two ant blocks collide, they merge into one. It cannot be pushed by pistons, and can replace bedrock.
