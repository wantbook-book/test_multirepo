### 2010
In 2010, Notch wrote that he had planned to make a video announcing "Minecraft 4D" for April Fools', but ran out of time due to moving into a new home.[1][2]

### 2011
Main article: Minecraft Store
In 2011, a fake "Minecraft Store" website was created. This was linked to by the locked chest, a block which was implemented for this purpose, as it was implied that keys had to be bought from said store to unlock these chests.

- Message displayed upon opening the chest.
- The "Minecraft Store".
- The store after it goes into "seizure-mode".
- The window popup about the "seizure-mode".
- How the store appeared after April Fools'.

### 2013
Main article: Java Edition 2.0
During 2013, Mojang released a pre-release for a fake future version containing numerous joke features to various YouTubers.[3]

- The 2.0 version banner.
- A pink wither.
- A talking block of coal.
- The "redstone bug" mob.
- 2.0's "super hostile" mode.

### 2014
A post was added to Mojang Studios' blog[4] for the joke. 

| “ | The long-nosed villagers introduced in Minecraft beta 1.9 have become sentient. They have taken over our skin servers and content delivery networks (CDN), so unfortunately you will not be able to change your skins until we fix the problem. We are desperately trying our best to pull the plugs, but we should prepare ourselves to serve under our new villager overlords. Singularity may be upon us. | „ |

|   | — The Minecraft Team                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   |

This caused all players' current skin to be replaced with the various villager skins, and caused users to be unable to change their skins unless they modified the launcher .json file. Different career villager skins were used, including the then-unused green robe of a nitwit villager.

In-game, villagers still acted the same, but they made different sounds. All noises were replaced with the sound effects of Element Animation's "T.E.A.V.S.R.P" (The Element Animation Villager Sounds Resource Pack). Mojang Studios also added in-game villager music. The title screen music contains a parody of the Game of Thrones theme, due to the new series starting in early April and also because of its being included in the original trailer for "T.E.A.V.S.R.P." Jeb also claimed the villager got his Twitter account.[5]

Grumm released the villager skins on Reddit on April 1, 2014. There were seven variants, including a base skin.

An updated version of T.E.A.V.S.R.P., complete with the new music, was released by Element Animation on April 2, 2014.

Soon afterward, Element Animation released this video, and the skins and the sounds were reverted to the way they were before on April 2, 2014.

#### Minecraft website
The minecraft.net website was updated to feature several intractable poisonous potatoes across the home page.

When health bar gets fully depleted, user is greeted with a "You Died!" screen saying "You awoke the Toxifin", showing the score (consuming a potato gives you 1500 score [?] ) and a big "Respawn" button. Clicking the "Respawn" button takes the user back to the minecraft.net and resets all the poisonous potatoes.
