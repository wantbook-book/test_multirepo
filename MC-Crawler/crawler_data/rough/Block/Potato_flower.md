## Obtaining
### Breaking
A potato flower can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

A potato flower also breaks if water or lava runs over its location, if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

### Natural generation
Potato flowers generate naturally in the Potato dimension, in all biomes except the hash biome.

Potato flowers also generate naturally in birch forests.

## Usage
### Bees

### Suspicious stew
A potato flower can be used for crafting a suspicious stew, which gives the Poison effect to the player for 12 seconds after eating it.
