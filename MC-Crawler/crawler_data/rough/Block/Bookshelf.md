## Obtaining
### Breaking
Bookshelves can be mined by hand, but are broken faster with an axe. In either case, they drop 3 books when broken, allowing the reconstruction of the bookshelf with the addition of six wood planks. When broken by a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, a bookshelf drops itself.

1. ↑Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

### Natural generation
Bookshelves can generate in village libraries and sometimes village houses.

Strongholds may contain up to two libraries, each of which may be single-level or have an upper balcony. These feature some bookshelves arranged in pillars, and more bookshelves arranged in pillars in the walls. Single-level libraries contain 161 bookshelves, while libraries with balconies contain 233.

Bookshelves also naturally generate in certain woodland mansion rooms.

## Usage
### Enchanting
Main article: Enchantment mechanics § Bookshelf placement
If an enchanting table is placed near a bookshelf, glyph particles fly from the bookshelf toward the enchanting table. Having bookshelves in the proper position near the table allows the table to apply higher-level enchantments.

Fifteen bookshelves need to be near an enchanting table to gain level 30 enchantments.
