## Obtaining
### Breaking
Crafting tables can be mined by hand or with any tool, but axes are the quickest.

1. ↑Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

### Natural generation
Crafting tables naturally generate in witch huts, igloos, trail ruins, woolen tents outside pillager outposts, and in some small village houses - only in savanna, desert and taiga villages.

## Usage
### Placement
Regardless of the player's position during placement, the different textures of the block are always facing in the same position (the textures with the saws are facing west and north, while the one with the crafting grid is facing up).

### Crafting
The GUI of the crafting table.
Main article: Crafting
Pressing use on a crafting table opens the 3×3 crafting grid that allows the player to craft many more items than are available with the crafting grid in the inventory, which is only 2×2.

The recipe book is available to the left of the crafting grid (collapsed by default in Java Edition, expanded by default in Bedrock Edition), which stores crafting recipes for reference and one-click crafting.

### Fuel
Crafting tables can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per crafting table.

### Repairing

Main article: item repair
A crafting table can be used to repair damaged tools, weapons, and armor. When two damaged items of the same material are combined side-by-side in the crafting grid they produce a new item with the sum of the durabilities plus a 5% bonus, with a maximum total of 100% durability for that item. Using this method does not require any experience, but removes any enchantments on either or both items. The only way to retain enchantments is to repair damaged items on an anvil.

### Note blocks
Crafting tables can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sounds.
