# Ancient Debris
Ancient debris is a rare ore found in the Nether, and is the main source of netherite scraps. Its high blast resistance makes it immune to normal explosions. In item form, it floats on lava and cannot be burned by any form of fire.

## Obtaining
### Breaking
Ancient debris drops itself if mined by a diamond pickaxe or netherite pickaxe. If mined by any other tool, it drops nothing.

| Block     | Ancient Debris        |

| Hardness  | 30                    |
| Tool      |                       |
|           | Breakingtime (sec)[A] |
| Default   | 150                   |
| Wooden    | 75                    |
| Stone     | 37.5                  |

1. ↑Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

### Natural generation
Ancient debris generates in the Nether in the form of scatter ores which are never naturally exposed to air.[note 1] They can only replace netherrack, basalt‌[Java Edition  only], and blackstone‌[Java Edition  only].

On average, Y-level 16 has the most ancient debris.

In Java Edition, up to two clusters may generate per chunk: one cluster of 0–3 ancient debris attempts to generate with a triangle distribution from levels 8 to 24, and an additional cluster of 0–2 ancient debris attempts to generate evenly from levels 8 to 119. There is an average of 1.65 ancient debris blocks per chunk[needs testing], with a normal maximum of 5. However, it is technically possible for up to 11 ancient debris to be found in a single chunk; adjacent chunks can generate blobs on the border with up to 2 blocks spawning in an adjacent chunk. As of Java Edition 1.16.5, on average they generate 1.56 ores per chunk. Given this number, and that there are 32768 blocks in a chunk (16×128×16), there is approximately a 0.004% chance that any randomly selected block will be an ancient debris block.

In Bedrock Edition, up to five clusters may generate per chunk: two clusters of 0–3 ancient debris attempt to generate evenly from levels 8 to 23, and an additional three clusters of 0–2 ancient debris attempt to generate evenly from levels 8 to 119.


### Chest loot
Ancient debris can appear in bastion chests, either as a singular item or as a stack of two items. These two options are rolled separately from each other.

| Item           | Structure       | Container           | Quantity | Chance          |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------|-----------------|

|                |                 | Treasure chest      | 1        | 27.1%           |
|                |                 | Generic chest       | 1        | 13.5%           |
| Ancient Debris | Bastion Remnant | Treasure chest      | 2        | 11.5%           |

## Usage
### Smelting ingredient
Ancient debris can be smelted using a furnace or blast furnace, which gives the player netherite scrap. If a player takes out the netherite scrap, they are rewarded with 2 experience points.

| Name            | Ingredients                 | Smelting recipe |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| Netherite Scrap | Ancient Debris+<br/>Anyfuel | 2               |

## Data values
### ID
Java Edition:

| Name           | Identifier       | Form         | Block tags                                  | Translation key                  |
|----------------|------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Ancient Debris | `ancient_debris` | Block & Item | `mineable/pickaxe`<br/>`needs_diamond_tool` | `block.minecraft.ancient_debris` |

Bedrock Edition:

| Name           | Identifier       | Numeric ID | Form                       | Item ID[i 1]   | Translation key            |
|----------------|------------------|------------|----------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Ancient Debris | `ancient_debris` | `526`      | Block & Giveable Item[i 2] | Identical[i 3] | `tile.ancient_debris.name` |

1. ↑ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.
2. ↑Available with /give command.
3. ↑The block's direct item form has the same id as the block.

## Notes
1. ↑The generation system explicitly attempts to place ancient debris where it is not exposed to air. Rarely, ancient debris can be exposed by later generation processes. It can also be exposed to fungi, or alongside smaller pockets of lava.
