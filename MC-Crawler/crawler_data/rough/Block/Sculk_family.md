# Sculk family
The sculk family is a set of "alien-looking blocks with unique properties".[1] These blocks appear exclusively within the deep dark biome. With the exception of sculk veins all sculk blocks drop only experience when broken with a tool that is not enchanted with Silk Touch. All blocks from this family are mined fastest with a hoe.
