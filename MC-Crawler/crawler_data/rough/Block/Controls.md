# Controls
Minecraft offers controls tailored for different input methods.  While Java Edition is playable only with a keyboard and mouse, Bedrock Edition has a wider variety of control schemes in order to accommodate players across all platforms. These controls can be changed in the options menu.

## Java Edition
### Non-configurable controls
Note: On many laptops and most Mac computers, "Function keys" (briefly "F-keys") do not operate in their default configuration. The player can often get around this by pressing the Fn key or sometimes the ⇧ Shift key while they press an F-key. To make F-keys work in macOS, go to the Apple menu → System Preferences → Keyboard and mouse and check the "Use F1, F2 etc. as normal keys." If the player choose the first option, they can then use the Fn key to switch F-keys back to actions they used to do (e.g. play/pause music, etc.). The player can also use the F-keys by holding the Option button while pressing them.

Java Edition uses a combination of the mouse and keyboard for controls, generically known as "mouselook/keymove." Many prior games (such as DOOM and Quake) have used such a scheme, but those who have not played such a game before may need practice to get around effectively. Creative mode or Peaceful difficulty in Survival mode are helpful for a player to gain familiarity with the controls.

For blocks, it is simply the block in item form. For mobs, the game places the corresponding spawn egg in the player's hand. This also works onboats, all types ofminecarts,paintings, andarmor stands‌[Java Edition  only][1]to get the entity in item form. If the item is in the hotbar, it switches the selected hotbar slot to the slot with that item. If the item is not in the hotbar, but in the player's inventory, it moves that item from the inventory into the hotbar. If no hotbar slot is empty, the item selected is replaced. In creative mode, if the item is not in the inventory, the game gives the player that item. This works only in creative mode for entities.‌[Java Edition  only][2]Hovering over an item in any inventory and clicking with the mouse wheel when in creative gives one full stack of that item. Dragging over slots of inventory/container while holding an item fills them with full stacks of copies of that item.If used on a tile entity while holding Ctrl, or ⌘ Cmd (for some Mac computers), the tile entity's nbt data are copied. The block given to the player has the Lore: (+NBT)‌[Java Edition  only] or (+DATA)‌[Bedrock Edition  only]..                |

This also means a player can punch an entity while eating/drinking, however the eating/drinking resets when a player presses Button 1.This button also uses items in the off-hand. Only items with a right click function can be used, and they are available only if the item in the main hand does not have a right click action, or its right click action cannot be performed. |

In recent versions of Java edition, holding the key causes single items to be dropped quickly from a stack. There is no actual "throw" command; "drop" (defaultQ) tosses anobjectapproximately 2 to 3blocksfrom the player.Eggs,ender pearls,eyes of ender, andsnowballscan be thrown by the "use" command (default right-clicking).Ctrl+Qdrops the whole stack of items. On Mac, even though most shortcuts use the command key,Ctrl+Qis still the "drop stack" bind.Note that there is no corresponding Pick Up command. Dropped items are picked up (if there is room in inventory/hotbar) by moving near them. Placed items are picked up by "mining" (e.g. chopping up a sign with an axe), when they behave as dropped items and can be picked up as such.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| F11         | Toggle Fullscreen              | key.fullscreen            | Toggles full-screen mode.When using some Apple keyboards, F11 must be pressed while holding Fn and Option to enter fullscreen. Using F11 alone toggles Exposé, and pressing F11 while holding Fn turns down the volume or vice versa, depending on system preferences.Some people are experiencing a bug while exiting from full-screen mode that causes an inescapable black screen. When that's the case, use Alt + Tab to switch out of Minecraft and switch it back to windowed mode.On Linux, mouse input is often buggy while in full-screen mode. After entering full-screen mode on Linux, the mouse typically restricts the player to a single 360-degree rotation. This can be fixed by hitting Esc to release the mouse then hitting Esc again to regrab it.Also, note that this may not respect multiple monitors and Minecraft may occupy all screens instead of the one it is active on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|           | Pick Block           | Pressing that button while looking at a block or an entity causes the game to attempt placing a corresponding item for the block or entity in the player's hand. For blocks, it is simply the block in item form. For mobs, the game places the corresponding spawn egg in the player's hand. This also works onboats, all types ofminecarts,paintings, andarmor stands‌[Java Edition  only][3]to get the entity in item form. If the item is in the hotbar, it switches the selected hotbar slot to the slot with that item. If the item is not in the hotbar, but in the player's inventory, it moves that item from the inventory into the hotbar. If no hotbar slot is empty, the item selected is replaced. In creative mode without the item in the inventory, the game gives the player that item.

### Controller
The "Controller" controls for gamepads are similar to the Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4 editions, with some differences. All of these controls, except the stick controls, can be changed in the Options. The Nintendo Switch version can be played with a pair of Joy-Con controllers, the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, or the Nintendo Switch Lite. It cannot be played with a single Joy-Con, as it does not have enough buttons or control sticks. If the gamepad has control sticks, then the left stick (////) would be used for moving and the right stick (////) would be used for looking. The blank spaces mean that the function is, by default, left unassigned and it is up to the player to assign a button to it. All platforms support gamepads.

| Mass crafting      | Long-press on recipe result for mass crafting. Works faster if no other visible recipe is affected by the current one (for example, while converting sugarcane into paper, the number of potential sugar available is recalculated on the go. Switching to – for example – Construction tab, speeds up the process because no other recipe needs to be recalculated now.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Note: For Xperia Play owners using the gamepad, while in creative mode, the lowest two rows of items are beneath the screen, and one cannot scroll down to see them. They are still accessible, but it requires either remembering how many times one has to press the directional buttons to access them, or trial-and-error. This is most prominent in the 4.0 update, as the amount of items has increased, and now sixteen items are hidden. The only way to see them is to turn on the option to use touch controls in the options menu.

### Legacy Console Edition
#### Notes
- On thePlayStation Vita Edition(when playing on the PlayStation Vita),Wii U Edition(when playing on the Wii U GamePad), andNintendo Switch Edition(when playing in Tabletop or Handheld mode), the touchscreen can be used to control the tooltips shown at the bottom of the screen (if enabled), as well as the menus and inventory.
