## Obtaining
### Breaking
Chiseled copper can be mined only with a stone pickaxe or better. If chiseled copper is mined without the use of a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

## Usage
Chiseled copper is a decorative block that oxidizes over time.

### Oxidation
Main article: Oxidation
Non-waxed chiseled copper has four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). Lightning bolts and axes can remove the oxidation on chiseled copper. Using a honeycomb on chiseled copper prevents it from oxidizing further.

As the block begins to oxidize (exposed), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized), the block is teal with several green spots.
