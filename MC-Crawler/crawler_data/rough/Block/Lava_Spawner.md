## Obtaining
### Breaking
Lava spawners can be broken instantly, regardless of held items.

### Chest loot
Lava spawners could be found in Indev House chests in stacks of 99 in in-20100124-2, and stacks of 100 in in-20100128. Prior to this, they were added to the player's inventory by default in a stack of 5.

## Usage
As lava spawners are full solid cubes, placed gears render on their sides.
The lava spawner has many visual and functional differences from normal lava:

- It is a full, solid cube block with full block collision.
- It does not damage entities.
- It does not emit light.
- All sides use the same still lava texture.

### Creating liquids
Immediately after placement, the lava spawner creates blocks of lava on each of its four orthogonal sides. If these created blocks are removed, they get regenerated after enough time.

### Sponges
Unlike with normal lava, lava spawners are deleted by sponges.
