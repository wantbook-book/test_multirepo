## Obtaining
### Breaking
Weak roots have no assigned tool, meaning they are mined at the same speed regardless of the tool used. Weak roots never drop as an item when mined, even with Silk Touch.

| Block    | Weak Roots          |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 0.4                 |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.6                 |

### Natural generation
Weak roots naturally generate in the Potato dimension in wasteland biome, connected to a powerful potato.

## Usage
Unlike strong roots, weak roots don't grow. To achieve any growth, player must mine and replace the powerful potato block, which causes strong roots to grow from it.

### Piston interactivity
Weak roots are destroyed when pushed by pistons. They do not stick to sticky pistons, slime blocks or honey blocks.
