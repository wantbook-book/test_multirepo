## Obtaining
### Breaking
The poisonous potato ore block itself (rather than its poisonous potato drops) can be obtained by mining it with an pickaxe that has the Silk Touch enchantment. The maximum amount of poisonous potatoes dropped can be increased with Fortune. Fortune I gives a 1⁄3 chance for 2 poisonous potatoes, averaging 1.33 poisonous potatoes, Fortune II gives a 25% chance (each) to give 2 or 3 poisonous potatoes, averaging 1.75 poisonous potatoes, and Fortune III gives a 20% chance (each) to give 2, 3, or 4 poisonous potatoes, averaging 2.2 poisonous potatoes.

Poisonous potato ore blocks also have an additional 5% chance to drop a poisonous potato plant regardless of Fortune level.
