## Interface
### Java Edition
The recipe book can be displayed in inventory, crafting table, furnace, blast furnace and smoker. The player must enter the GUI and press the knowledge book icon; the recipe book then opens to the left.

Recipes are stored in several different tabs:

** Crafting Table and Inventory **
- - the first, topmost tab contains every unlocked recipe.
- - the second tab contains utility items,tools,weaponsandarmor.
- - the third tab contains building materials.
- - the fourth tab containsfooditems and miscellaneous things.
- - the fifth tab containsredstonematerials.

** Furnace **
- - the first, topmost tab contains every unlocked recipe.
- - the second tab containsfooditems.
- - the third tab contains building and decorative materials.
- - the fourth tab contains miscellaneous things.

** Blast Furnace **
- - the first, topmost tab contains every unlocked recipe.
- - the second tab contains the smelting recipe forRedstone Ore.[1]
- - the third tab contains smeltedoresand recipes for recycling iron, gold, and chainmail gear.

** Smoker **
- - the first, topmost tab contains every unlocked recipe.
- - the second tab containsfooditems.

Interacting an item in the recipe book shows all the patterns.
Clicking on an item in the list displays its recipe in the grid. The item can then be crafted if the materials are available; otherwise, the button containing the item is highlighted red. Each click shows alternate patterns for the same crafting recipe, if there are several patterns (for example, each click on a banner crafting recipe shows all the possible banners using different colored wools). Right-click on the item shows all the alternate patterns.

Shift-clicking an item in the list puts all available materials in the crafting grid.

The button in the top right corner of the recipe book toggles between "Show all" and "Show craftable"; the latter displays only recipes for which the player has the necessary materials in their inventory. The top-left corner also contains a search bar to further narrow the list.

There are also recipes for campfires and stonecutters, but they don't have a recipe book interface.

Tabs for specific categories can be hidden from the recipe book if there are no known recipes for that particular tab, but the search tab is always visible even if there are no known recipes.

### Bedrock Edition
Unlike Java Edition, the recipe book can be displayed only in the inventory and crafting table in Survival mode. The player must enter the GUI and click on the recipe book tab.

Recipes are stored in several different tabs. The tabs contain matching items from each tab of the Creative inventory, so an item found in a particular tab in Creative can be found in its equivalent tab in the recipe book, should it have a recipe.

The tabs are as follows:

- Construction- contains building materials.
- Equipment- contains tools, weapons, and armor.
- Items- containsoreitems and miscellaneous things.
- Nature- contains nature-related materials and food.
- All- contains every unlocked recipe.

Clicking on an item in the list puts all available materials in the crafting grid, displaying the recipe. The item can then be crafted if the materials are available; otherwise, the button containing the item is highlighted red. Right-click on the item automatically crafts it, and pressing ⇧ Shift crafts all items based on how many materials the player have in the inventory.

The button in the top right corner of the recipe book toggles between "All" and "Craftable"; the latter displays only recipes for which the player has the necessary materials in their inventory. The top-left corner also contains a search bar to further narrow the list.

## Unlocking

It may contain inappropriate or inaccurate information. Please help us by rewriting it.Reason: furnace/smoker/blast furnace/campfire recipes; bedrock "unlock" system


The notification that pops up when new recipes are unlocked.
The player must unlock recipes before using them in the recipe book. Recipes are unlocked upon meeting certain criteria; while for most recipes, one must hold a specific item, there are a few exceptions (for instance, boats are unlocked by touching water, whereas chests are unlocked after filling ten inventory slots). Once a recipe has been unlocked, the player is alerted of it via a notification that appears in the top right-hand corner of the screen, and the recipe becomes accessible through its relevant interface (inventory, crafting table, furnace, et cetera).

By default, the player does not need the recipes to craft a specific item; if they know a recipe without it being unlocked, they can insert the required items into the interface manually. However, if doLimitedCrafting is set to true, a recipe must be unlocked in order to craft a specific item at all.

Recipes can be granted or retracted by force, either through use of the /recipe command or a knowledge book. 

In Bedrock Edition, if recipesUnlock is set to false while creating a world, the player can view all recipes.
