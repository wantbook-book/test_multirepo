This section is missing information about how to use things in off hand. 
Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page.


Players can equip an item to the 
 off-hand slot from the inventory, similarly to armor. Players can also select an item and press F by default to automatically equip it. The off-hand slot then appears beside the HUD opposite from the main hand. If the player is in first-person view, then the off-hand appears in the screen along with the held item. Whichever hand should be the main hand is configurable in the Skin Customization menu.

The off-hand can use the item it holds when there are no usable items on the main hand (e.g. swords), or the item held on the main hand cannot be used directly (e.g. shovel or hoe while not looking at a grass block). Otherwise, the main hand takes priority over the off-hand. Players also cannot break blocks or attack with the off-hand, even if nothing is held in the main hand.

### Combat
A player holding a shield and an iron sword.
Arrows held in the off-hand are prioritized over other arrows in the hotbar and the inventory. Players can equip a specific arrow in their off-hand slot to fire it with a bow. If the bow is on the off-hand, then the arrow selected on the hotbar (with the main hand) is prioritized. Shields can be held in the off-hand as defense.

A player can also equip a bow, crossbow or trident in their off-hand. So far, these are the only weapons that can be used in this slot or in conjunction with another weapon. This allows for higher damage output, as players no longer have to switch between a melee and distance weapon; however, it disables the use of a shield. Players can left-click to attack with the equipped melee weapon, and right click to attack with the ranged weapon. However, if a player collides with an entity or another player while using a Riptide-enchanted trident, damage is dealt with the item in the player's main hand.

### Tool use
When a tool with a right-click function is held in the off-hand with another tool or weapon selected in the hotbar, right-clicking on a block that is relevant to the off-hand tool uses that off-hand tool unless the selected tool in the hotbar can also be used on the same block, in which case the hotbar tool has priority.

When a firework is in the off-hand slot and is being used with a crossbow, right-click and hold to charge and when ready, right click again to fire a firework. Fireworks can be fired from crossbows only when in the off-hand slot.

### Bedrock Edition
In Bedrock Edition, only a select few items can be placed in the off-hand slot and be dual-wielded. Some are related to combat, like shields, arrows, tipped arrows, firework rockets or the totem of undying, while others are for exploring, like filled maps or explorer maps, and for aesthetic such as sparklers and nautilus shells.
