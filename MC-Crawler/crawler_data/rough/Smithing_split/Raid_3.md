### Villagers
In Java Edition during a raid, villagers emit "sweat particles". At least one villager rushes to the village meeting point and rings the bell to alert other villagers to get inside their houses during the warmup of an upcoming raid wave. 

After successfully defending a village from a raid, the villagers emerge from their houses and celebrate, by setting off firework rockets and cheering, although villagers do not have a celebrate sound unlike the illagers.

#### Gifts
Villagers give players gifts after the raid in Java Edition. Villagers throw items at the player that are related to their profession. After throwing a gift a villager has a cooldown between 30 seconds and 5 minutes before they can throw another gift at the player. That means the more villagers the player has, the more gifts they receive.

### Witches
In Java Edition, witches participating in a raid often help other illagers by splashing a Potion of Regeneration or Healing. Witches do not attack villagers and do not throw harmful potions at them.[2]

In Bedrock Edition, witches participating in a raid do now heal other illagers and attack iron golems. Witches are passive toward villagers, but their harmful splash potions might hit a villager by accident.

### Mobs not counted
Vexes summoned by evokers do not count as part of the raid. Killing them has no effect on the raiding bar, and the raid can end in victory even if there are vexes remaining.

### Expiring
If a raid goes on for 48,000 ticks (40 minutes in real time) the raid bossbar disappears, and a message appears saying "raid expired". Although, any living illagers stay until they are killed.
