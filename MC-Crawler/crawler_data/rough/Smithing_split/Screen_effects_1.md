When the player is on fire, this effect is applied to the screen. This is caused by being inside of fire or lava (even in Creative mode, although not in Spectator), after exiting such a block (except in Creative/Spectator), or being set on fire through the attack of a burning mob or a burning arrow.

This overlay always displays as fire, even if the player in question is inside of soul fire.

In Java Edition this effect involves two intersecting texture planes being rendered across the bottom half of the screen with the fire texture.

In Bedrock Edition, a single fire texture is stretched across the bottom two-thirds of the screen.

Note: this section discusses the nether portal texture overlay. The nether portal/nausea effect is discussed in the Distortion effect/Distortion overlay sections.

When the player is inside of a nether portal, this effect is applied to the screen. It always coincides with either the distortion effect and/or its overlay.

In Java Edition this effect involves the nether portal texture being stretched across the entirety of the screen.

In Bedrock Edition, the texture is instead arranged into a cube, fixed around the player's point of view much like the suffocation effect.

### Underwater

The underwater effect is similar to the vignette (screen effect giving a circular shadow around the screen) with a blue tint.
