### Crosshair
The crosshair is a small cross in the middle of the screen. It shows the aim point of the tool or item being held. The crosshair inverts the colors of the area it is upon, which can result in a nearly invisible crosshair if the area is a medium gray. The crosshair is not shown if the player is playing on a mobile device and has turned off Split Controls.

If the option for the attack indicator is set to "Crosshair" mode, weapon cooldown time is indicated by a sword icon near the crosshair that fills, representing the cooldown progress.  This sword icon disappears once the weapon is fully cooled.  In this mode, if a fully cooled weapon is being held, and a mob or player is in range, the sword icon and an additional plus-sign (+) indicator is shown below the crosshair, indicating that the weapon is in range to land a full-damage blow.‌[Java Edition  only]

### Effects
All effects (other than effects with hideParticles, including Darkness from the warden[1]) the player currently has are shown on the top-right of the screen. Effects that run out sooner appear farther to the left, and effects that are about to run out start to flash. Additionally, positive effects are shown on the top, and other effects (neutral or negative) are shown on the bottom. Beacon effects have a blue (instead of gray) outline, and effects with particles hidden are not indicated in the HUD.

### Riding mobs

The full horse jump bar/camel dash bar.
Upon mounting a camel, horse, donkey, mule, llama, pig, or strider, the mob's health bar appears above the hunger bar, which the former uses a slightly different heart texture than the player's health bar, as they are meant to look like saddles. Also, upon mounting a horse or camel, the horse jump bar/camel dash bar also appears above the experience bar. When riding a skeleton horse underwater, the oxygen bar, if necessary, appears above the mob health bar.

## Options
In the options menu, the GUI scale option changes the size of the HUD and GUI. The default setting, "auto", changes the size of the HUD and GUI depending on the size of the game window.‌[Java Edition  only]

There is an option to hide the HUD. If the player is using keyboard controls, this can also be done with F1. In Bedrock Edition, the "Hide HUD" option toggles the hotbar, crosshair, and if using touch controls, buttons. The hand, paper doll, and coordinates are separate options.

In Bedrock Edition, the /hud command can toggle the visibility of each HUD element.

Players can toggle the HUD, the vignette effect on fancy graphics, the pumpkin "view" and the block hitbox by pressing the F1 key. The F1 key will also toggle the surrounding darkness when using the spyglass.

The HUD also contains the debug screen,‌[Java Edition  only] which can be shown or hidden using F3. Pressing Shift + F3 adds the additional pie chart showing resource allocation. Pressing Alt + F3 shows the FPS and TPS chart.

The player can choose whether to use their right or left hand.‌[Java Edition  only] This option also moves the off-hand slot to the opposite side.
