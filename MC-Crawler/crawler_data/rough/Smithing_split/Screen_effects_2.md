When within a spherical radius of 50 blocks of an elder guardian, the player is inflicted with Mining Fatigue III. This is indicated by a ghost of an elder guardian appearing in the players view, moving from the top of the screen to the bottom.

This occurrence is considered a particle effect and can be summoned with the /particle minecraft:elder_guardian command.‌[Java Edition  only]

The model of the elder guardian is used for this effect. This means that changing the texture and model associated with the elder guardian will also change what appears on the players screen.

The effect is used when a totem of undying is popped (saved the player from a death). The totem spins to the middle of the screen and disappears.
