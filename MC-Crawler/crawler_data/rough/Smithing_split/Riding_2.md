Main article: Skeleton Horseman
Skeleton horseman is a jockey consisting of a skeleton (or stray and wither skeleton) riding a skeleton horse. Skeleton horsemen spawn only from a "skeleton trap horse".

### Baby piglin riding baby hoglin
Main articles: Piglin and Hoglin
Baby piglins play with baby hoglins, running around and riding upon them. Up to 3 baby piglins may stack on top of each other while riding a baby hoglin. In Bedrock Edition, a baby hoglin can support 3 baby piglins, which looks like they are stacked one by one. However, in Java Edition, baby piglins ride each other and are indeed stacked one by one, instead of all riding on the hoglin.

### Strider or zombified piglin riding strider
Main articles: Strider and Zombified Piglin
For every strider that spawns, there is a 1 in 10 chance of an additional baby strider to spawn riding on top of the previous strider. Zombified piglins have a 1 in 30 chance of spawning on top of a strider.

### Illager riding ravager
Main article: Ravager
A ravager generated in raids may generate with a pillager, evoker or vindicator riding on it.

### Parrot riding player
Main article: Parrot
A tamed parrot on the ground can be made to perch on its player's shoulder by moving through the parrot. In Bedrock Edition, technically the parrot is riding the player. In Java Edition, technically the parrot on the shoulder is not an entity.

## Valid riding combinations in vanilla

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition. 


In Bedrock Edition, whether an entity is rideable is mainly defined with minecraft:rideable component and entity familliers in vanilla behavior packs. Besides, some entities have hardcoded riding behaviors, for, example, wardens being not able to riding a boat, boat doing not pick up adult horses although they can ride boats via /ride command.

In the following table, none means that the entity is rideable by these families no matter what component groups it has. Multiple components separated by | symbols means that the entity must have at least one of them to be rideable by these families.
