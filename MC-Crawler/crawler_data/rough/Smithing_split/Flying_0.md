## Controls
Flying is not limited by any processes such as food depletion, which limits sprinting. Flying can be toggled by double-tapping the "jump" key while playing in creative mode (or when the "May fly" permission has been given to the player ‌[Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education  only]) and can be activated at any altitude. The player can gain or lose altitude while flying by pressing the jump or sneak keys, respectively. Holding sprint allows the player to move faster while flying. In Creative mode, flying is automatically disabled if the player lowers onto a surface while in the air. ‌[Java Edition  only] In Spectator mode, flying cannot be disabled because players can fly through all blocks. Flying increases the player's field of view by 10%; it is increased further when holding sprint.
(This may have to be attempted several times before it works.)

## Speed
Flying makes the player move at around 10.92 meters/second (39.312 km/h), which is approximately 250% of the normal walking speed, being 4.36 meters/second (15.724 km/h). This is increased further when holding the sprint key to 21.6 meters/second (77.76 km/h). When flying, friction is reduced to a level equivalent to when on ice. A player flying in fluids or cobwebs neither sinks nor slows down. The Speed effect does not increase flying speed.[1]
In the Spectator mode, scrolling up on the scroll wheel increases speed while scrolling down decreases it.‌[Java Edition  only] Players that stop flying drift a few blocks in the air.‌[Java Edition  only] Also, players automatically stop flying if they touch any surface.‌[Java Edition  only]
