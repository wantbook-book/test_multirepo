# Death messages
Death messages are messages sent in the chat to either all players or a specific player to announce the death of a player or pet. These messages communicate how the entity died, and some are intended to be humorous.

Upon the death of a player, a death message is broadcast to everyone on a server. Upon the death of a pet wolf, cat, or parrot the message is broadcast to the pet's owner in Java Edition or to all players in the world in Bedrock Edition.[1] In Bedrock Edition, death messages are also produced upon the death of a pet horse, donkey, mule, llama, or trader llama.[2]

In Java Edition, death messages are automatically recorded in the game's logs. The death of a villager or a renamed mob is recorded in the game's logs, but not broadcast in chat.

Death messages can be made not to appear in chat (and therefore broadcast to other players) with the game rule showDeathMessages. This also affects the notification of a pet's death.

- <player> fell while climbing
	- Appears when the player is killed by falling after being on a climbable block that is not one of the aforementioned ones.
		- Onlycave vinesfall into this category in the vanilla game,[3]however one can make more blocks climbable using data packs.
	- Also appears when the player falls from any climbable block, changes dimension before dying, and then dies to fall damage.
		- This assumes there being no climbable block in the exact same position in the dimension the player teleported to, as the climbable block the player fell from. For instance, if a player falls off a ladder at x=0, y=100, z=0 in the overworld and they teleport to the End before they die, it must be the case that the block at x=0, y=100, z=0 in the End is not climbable, for this death message to appear.
			- If that block is climbable, then the death message for that block appears instead. In this example, if the block at those coordinates in the End is a vine (instead of a ladder), the death message<player> fell off some vinesappears instead of<player> fell off a ladder.
- death.fell.accident.water
	- Appears when the player dies to fall damage in water, which is ordinarily impossible because water cancels all fall damage.

- <player> was doomed to fall by <player/mob>
	- Appears when the player takes any damage caused by an entity, then dies to a greater than 5 block fall.
		- This includesallentities, including non-mob entities, which means that, apart from a player or mob, <player/mob> in this case can also be any of the following, if the entity does not have a player or mob as its owner (if shot by a dispenser or summoned with/summon): arrow, spectral arrow, trident, fireball, small fireball, firework rocket, primed TNT, minecart with TNT, falling block (appears as "Falling <block name>").
			- Lightning bolts would be included in the list if they didn't deal environmental damage.
			- Thrown snowballs, eggs and ender pearls could theoretically also be included in the list, but they currently don't deal damage.
			- Wither skulls could theoretically also be included in the list, but they deal environmental damage when they don't have an owner.
			- Shulker bullets, thrown splash potions of harming and area effect clouds could theoretically also be included in the list, but strangely, the death message for dying to fall damage after being hit by one of those entities if they don't have an owner is<player> was doomed to fall.
			- Llama spits could theoretically also be included in the list, but they do not deal damage when they don't have an owner.

It also cannot appear in chat, but only on the client side death screen message under the "You Died!" title.[4]

** Unsendable death messages **
The following table contains all death messages that can appear. Death messages in italic text are documented above, while messages in bold text can be achieved only with /damage, and thus are considered unsendable.
There are four types of context in which death messages can appear:

- The base environmental message, which appears when the damage is dealt without any entity being involved. Damage types whose base message contains the%2$svariable don't fill in any of the variables, resulting in the messages containing "%1$s" and "%2$s".
- The base entity message, which appears when the damage is dealt directly by a player or mob. The translation for this message is always the same as the base environmental message. Damage types whose base message contains the%2$svariable now fill in all variables, while base messages that don't contain that variable are completely indistinguishable from base environmental messages, though they are considered different messages and should not be confused with the base environmental messages.
- The.playermessage, which appears when the damage is dealt without any entity in mind, right after damage by a player or mob was dealt to the victim.
- The.itemmessage, which appears in place of the base entity message when the attacker was holding a renamed item during the victim's death.

The fall damage type shows a different set of messages if the height the victim fell from was greater than 5 blocks. Those messages are documented above.
The bad_respawn_point damage type is excluded from the table, as it shows the exact same death message in every context without changing any variables.

| Damage type                                       | Base message (environmental)                           | Base message (by entities)                             | .player message                                                                            | .item message                                                                                              |

There are also a few other death messages which are unsendable:

- <player> fell too far and was finished by <player/mob>
	- Appears when the player takes damage that isn't fall or void damage, falls at least 5 blocks then takes fall damage dealt directly by a player or mob, which is only possible through the use of/damage.
- <player> fell too far and was finished by <player/mob> using <item>
	- Appears in the same situation as the previous message but instead when the player or mob that deals the fall damage is holding a renamed item.
