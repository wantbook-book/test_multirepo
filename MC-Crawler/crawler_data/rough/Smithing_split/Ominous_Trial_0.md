## Behavior
### Initiation
When a player with the Bad Omen effect is within the 14 block detection radius of a trial spawner that has line of sight with the player (and the spawner is not already ominous), the player's Bad Omen effect is replaced with the Trial Omen effect, and the ominous trial begins. The duration of the Trial Omen effect is equal to 15 minutes multiplied by the level of the Bad Omen effect, regardless of the remaining duration on the Bad Omen effect. Any player with Trial Omen is part of the ominous trial event and surrounded by blue skull particles.

When a trial spawner becomes ominous, it despawns its current mobs and begins the ominous trial. The cooldown of the spawner is skipped if it was not previously ominous before going on cooldown, then becomes ominous.

The Trial Omen effect is not removed upon a trial spawner becoming ominous. Therefore, the ominous trial lasts until the effect runs out or is cleared.

### Effects
During an ominous trial, any trial spawner the player activates becomes an ominous trial spawner. These spawners have many effects. Firstly, they spawn mobs with equipment very frequently. This includes items such as trimmed chainmail armor, for example. Ominous trial spawners additionally summon projectiles and lingering potions above players and mobs. Upon being defeated, ominous trial spawners eject loot from a different loot table than regular trial spawners. This loot table includes items such as ominous trial keys. An ominous trial is the only method of obtaining ominous trial keys.

### Rewards
In addition to the items ejected by ominous trial spawners, once an ominous trial key is found, an ominous vault can be opened.
In Java Edition 1.21, each trial chambers ominous vault contains  items drawn from 3 pools,  with the following distribution:
