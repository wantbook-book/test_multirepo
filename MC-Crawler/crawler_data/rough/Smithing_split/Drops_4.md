Items in suspicious gravel and suspicious sand don't drop when being broken even with Silk Touch. Instead, abrushis needed to get those items. |

Notes:

- Blocks marked with "T" need to be broken with a specific tool to drop anything (includingexperience). TheSilk Touchenchantment doesn't remove this requirement.
- Where noted,Fortunecan increase the number of dropped items or multiply it. Increase simply gives 0-lvl extra items. Multiplication happen with the following chances:
	- Fortune I: 33% * 2 (33% more on average)
	- Fortune II: 25% * 2, 25% * 3 (75% more on average)
	- Fortune III: 20% * 2, 20% * 3, 20% * 4 (120% more on average)
- Container blocks (barrels,blast furnaces,brewing stands,campfires,chests,chiseled bookshelves,decorated pots,dispensers,droppers,flower pots,furnaces,glow item frames‌[BE  only],hoppers,item frames‌[BE  only],jukeboxes,lecterns,smokers,soul campfires, andtrapped chests) drop themselves when broken along with their content.
