### Trapping
This strategy is useful to deal with large numbers of mobs or mobs that are too strong for you to deal with in melee combat. It is recommended early game as it is very cheap and doesn't require a lot of skill, although it requires some creativity.

Required items:

- Pickaxe and Shovel.
- Blocks and water bucket.
- A flint and steel and a lava bucket, or more than 1 if possible.
- A bow or crossbow to hit any trapped mobs.
- A sword to finish off opponents.

Other items that help greatly for strategy:

- Cobwebs as an alternative, very easy way to slow or trap mobs.
- Turtle eggs to draw mobs towards them and into one space.
- Soul sand to slow mobs walking over it.

Instructions:

1. Use the blocks, pickaxe, and water to create or dig out a ditch in front of you for mobs to fall into, or to be trapped in. Use cobwebs or arrows to slow mobs if needed and corral the mobs into an area where you can perch above or below them and swing at them with your sword safely. If necessary it should be easy for you to back up and heal.
2. Use the cobwebs, flint and steel, and lava between you and mobs as they advance towards you, staying out of their reach as they are killed by your utility items. Continually back up and make sure you aren't being backed into a corner, pelting them with arrows to deal extra damage and push them further back.

Cons:

- Can be slow and requires you to have a lot of space available.
- You must be careful not to fall into your own traps and hazards, as you will then be trapped in a pit of mobs without the propper weapons to deal with them.
- Not as effective against ranged mobs like Skeletons as they can shoot you while you are placing down traps.

Pros:

- Only uses some early game materials such as cobblestone and flint/steel.
- Doesn't require very expensive or strong materials in terms of armor or weapons.
- Often very safe, as the player loses very little health and armor durability in the process, only engaging mobs once they have been properly trapped.
- Scales very well against large numbers of mobs.

## The enchantments
### Sword enchantments
- Knockback is effective when near environmental hazards like very steep ledges or cacti, and it is very useful for fighting multiple creepers. However, as much as possible, avoid using it on foes that have ranged attacks, like blazes or skeletons. Knockback 1 is a good enchantment to use if your opponent has netherite armor, as netherite decreases knockback taken.
- Fire Aspect is one of the most valuable enchantments in-game, as considered by most players. However, if you spend a lot of time in the Nether then this enchantment is virtually useless, since most nether mobs are fire-resistant.
- Bane of Arthropods is very resourceful for clearing mineshafts and strongholds. The sword itself can cut throughcobwebsquickly, while the enchantment (at least Bane of Arthropods II) can instantly kill cave spiders and spiders if the sword is diamond. A Bane of Arthropods IV diamond sword can make you sure you kill a regular spider in one hit. Bane of Arthropods is also useful against silverfish as if it kills them in one hit, and it prevents them from alerting other silverfish inside monster eggs, averting a possible swarm.
- Sharpness is the most versatile enchantment for the sword, it does not have any disadvantages against certain mobs, but does neither have any good advantages against certain mobs.
- Smite is a good enchantment for surviving the night without a shelter. As it increases damage dealt to skeletons, zombies and phantoms which spawn in hordes. It is also useful for killing the wither.
- Sweeping Edge‌[Java Edition  only]is the best enchantment for clearing a horde of monsters which usually spawn from monster spawners in monster rooms, nether fortresses or abandoned mineshafts. Sweeping Edge III hasweeping attack power for better slash damage, but Sweeping Edge can also kill multiple mobs in a farm quickly, especially chickens.

### Bow enchantments
- Punch is more effective for battle archers than for snipers. The increased Knockback on mobs lets the user push enemies back, granting them time to use fully charged shots more before retaliating with sword strikes.
- Power is more effective for snipers than for battle archers, as the enchantment requires fully charged shots and allows the user to kill enemies in fewer shots.
- Flame will set targets on fire, allowing the user to focus on more than one target at once and it will also increase the overall damage dealt per shot as any enemies hit by a Flame arrow will suffer both arrow impact damage and additional burn damage overtime after that. Flame is very ineffective against Nether mobs or any other fire-resistant enemies.
- Infinity is very good for snipers and battle archers alike. A sniper will usually be in an isolated spot, where the slightest bit of movement may alert enemies, preventing them from easily resupplying more arrows. Infinity helps remedy this problem as the use will only need one arrow to keep firing the bow until it breaks. Battle archers do not need to worry about wasting any arrows, so they can be as trigger happy as they want (as long as the bow doesn't break), allowing them to lay down an impressive amount of fire. Just be aware of the fact that Infinity does not work with tipped arrows, they will still be consumed just like they would be without the enchantment.

### Axe enchantments
- Sharpness, Smite and Bane of Arthropods all have the same effect as they would have on a sword, but axes have higher base damage and will, therefore, deal more damage per hit.‌[Java Edition  only]
- Unbreaking can help counteract the problem that axes lose durability twice as fast if used as a weapon.
