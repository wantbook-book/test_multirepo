### Calculation
Combining all of the information above yields the following pseudo-code to calculate how long in seconds a player takes to mine a certain block. All operations are floating-point, not integer.

if (isBestTool):
  speedMultiplier = toolMultiplier
  if (not canHarvest):
    speedMultiplier = 1
  else if (toolEfficiency):
    speedMultiplier += efficiencyLevel ^ 2 + 1
else:
  speedMultiplier = 1

if (hasteEffect):
  speedMultiplier *= 0.2 * hasteLevel + 1

if (miningFatigue):
  speedMultiplier *= 0.3 ^ min(miningFatigueLevel, 4)

if (inWater and not hasAquaAffinity):
  speedMultiplier /= 5

if (not onGround):
  speedMultiplier /= 5

damage = speedMultiplier / blockHardness

if (canHarvest):
  damage /= 30
else:
  damage /= 100

# Instant breaking
if (damage > 1):
  return 0

ticks = roundup(1 / damage)

seconds = ticks / 20

return seconds

### Best tools
Fastest tools to mine specific blocks:
