Despite doing damage to entities, fireworks do not destroy terrain and as such are not counted as conventional explosions.

Lab tables sometimes perform a non-terrain-damaging explosion when creating garbage item.‌[BE & edu  only]

## Blast resistance
"Blast resistance" redirects here.  For the enchantment, see Blast Protection.
Not to be confused with Hardness.

The following table shows blast resistance values for blocks as shown in Minecraft's code. In Add-on documentation for Bedrock Edition, these values are multiplied by 5 when used for the "explosion_resistance" value in the "minecraft:descructible_by_explosion" component.
