For players, a "You Died!" screen (or "Game Over!" in Hardcore mode) appears, displaying a death message; in Java Edition, the player's score is also displayed. In Java Edition, the view of the world is tinted red, render distance is reduced to default, the camera-view slowly tilts as if falling over, shudders, and zooms in slightly. In Bedrock Edition, the screen is slightly darkened, a maroon vignette appears and closes around the screen, render distance is set to default, camera switches to third-person view, shudders and zooms out for the purpose of allowing the player to see their cause of death. The following options appear on the screen:

- Respawn, either in the lastbedtheplayerslept in, at theirdefault spawn point(their first spawn point in the game), theirrespawn anchor, or at the spawn pointset by commands. InHardcoremode, the player canrespawnonly inSpectatormode, and cannot continue becausecheatsare disabled.
- Return to thetitle screen.‌[JE  only]
- A link to give feedback on the death screen.‌[BE  only]

The death screen is not shown upon death if:

- The player holds aTotem of Undyingin the main hand or off-hand and died without falling into thevoid, in which case the player resurrects upon death. Resurrection does not happen if the player fell into the void.
- Thegame ruledoImmediateRespawnis set totrue, in which case the player instantly respawns upon death without the death screen appearing, but still shows death message.

Any items or blocks that were in the player's inventory (except items enchanted with Curse of Vanishing) are dropped from their head, and scattered around the spot where the player died (unless the game rule keepInventory is set to true). Like any dropped item, these drops decay after five minutes while that chunk is loaded.

The player also loses any experience accumulated, reverting the level back to 0 (unless the game rule keepInventory is set to true) and drops experience orbs with a precise total value of player last level × 7 experience points (with a maximum of 100). After reaching between levels 7 and 8, the player always drops only 100 experience points regardless of level.

The player also loses all effects upon respawning, even when the game rule keepInventory is set to true.[3]

Despite the fact that dead players disappear like all other mobs, it is still possible for the player to see their own hand while in the first-person mode.[4]
