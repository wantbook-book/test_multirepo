In Java Edition, journeyman-level armorer villagers have a 40% chance of offering to buy one diamond for one emerald. Expert-level toolsmith villagers have 2⁄3 chance of offering to buy one diamond for one emerald. Expert-level weaponsmith villagers always offer to buy one diamond for one emerald.

- Diamond Helmet
- Diamond Chestplate

### Beacons
Diamonds can be used to select powers from a beacon. The player must select one of the available powers then insert a diamond into the item slot. 

A diamond can be substituted for an iron ingot, a gold ingot, an emerald or a netherite ingot.
