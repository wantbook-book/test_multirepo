#### Polar bears

See also: Polar bear

When alone, polar bears are neutral in that they attack the player if they are attacked, but they can also be immediately hostile when approached if a polar bear cub is nearby. If the cub is attacked, any adults in a 41 block cuboid area come to its defense. Attacking the adult first when a cub is nearby causes all adults in a 21 block cuboid to attack the player. Cubs are passive in any situation. 

Polar bears have 30 × 15 health, and thus can't be killed in one melee hit in Survival mode, although two critical hits with a netherite sword with Sharpness V are enough to slay them. Bears deal 4 damage on Easy, 6 on Normal, and 9 on Hard. They attack by rearing up on their back legs and smashing down with their front legs. This attack can sometimes miss or be dodged if the players is moving in circles or irregularly. Iron gear or better makes battling them in low numbers trivial, but when in large groups (which is fairly uncommon) they can quickly overwhelm the player. The player can create a 3 block tall pillar to easily dispatch of any hostile adults.

Polar bears have a much faster swimming speed than the player, so it is recommended to not engage polar bears in water if possible.

#### Llamas

See also: Llama

Llamas attack if provoked by spitting at the target once for 1 damage, after which they become neutral again. Llamas can have between 15 × 7.5 and 30 × 15 health points. Their extremely low damage and lack of pack mentality basically nullifies them as a threat to any player with weapons or armor of any level. However, if the player happens to find themselves completely unarmed and unprotected against a llama with half a heart of health left, its spit can be dodged by sprinting sideways to the llama.

##### Trader llamas

See also: Trader llama

If player hits a wandering trader, the trader's llamas become angry and spit at the player. The player can dodge attack or make 2 trader llamas attack each other by hide behind one of the llamas. However, if the wandering trader isn't present, hitting trader llamas causes them to act like a passive mob and run away.

#### Dolphins

See also: Dolphin

If player hits a dolphin, this and any other dolphins nearby become hostile (pack behavior). Players can avoid them by getting out of water. 

Dolphins have 10 health: one critical hit with any axe is enough to kill them, but hitting them might be tricky due to fast movements, so a sword is recommended instead. Dolphins deal 2.5 × 1.25 damage on Easy difficulty, 3 on Normal and 4.5 × 2.25 on Hard. Since dolphins are aquatic mobs, they are affected by Impaling enchantment.‌[Java Edition  only]

Another weakness of dolphins is their need of both air and water to survive. If kept out of water or underwater for long enough, dolphins die of dehydration or drowning, respectively.

#### Pandas

See also: Panda

Pandas come in 7 different types, with each having different AI.

Most pandas behave like llamas: they attack if provoked by biting once, after which they become neutral again. Aggresive pandas are different: once provoked, they attack their target until death. Aggressive pandas also become angry if any nearby panda is attacked. All pandas deal 4 damage on Easy, 6 on Normal and 9 on Hard.

Most pandas have 20 × 10 health and can be killed in one hit in the same ways as creepers. Weak pandas are different, as they have only 10. All pandas are rather slow, but lazy pandas are even slower than other types. Worried panda flee from players and most hostile mobs (but still attack back if provoked). Playful pandas often roll over and jump. This can sometimes cause harm or kill the panda as it can accidentally roll off a cliff or into other environmental hazards. Brown panda doesn't have any special AI, it just looks different than normal panda.

A pack of aggresive pandas can be a real threat, especially on Hard difficulty; engaging in melee combat with them is dangerous, so using a lava bucket or a bow is recommended in such circumstances.

#### Bees

See also: Bee

Bees are provoked in three different ways:

1. If player hits a bee;
2. If player breaks abee nestorbeehivewithout Silk Touch;
3. If player collects honey from the nest/hive and there is nocampfirebeneath it.

All bees nearby become hostile when a bee is provoked (pack behavior). When provoked, bee's eyes turn red. An angry bee stings its target once, after which it becomes neutral again. If provoked again, it's eyes also turn red, but it peforms no further stinging attempts, since it had only one stinger. Bees become neutral if they fail to land a hit on their target within 25 seconds.

One minute after stinging, bee dies on its own.

Effects of the sting depend on difficulty:

- On Easy, sting deals 2damage and doesn't inflictPoisoneffect.
- On Normal, sting deals 2damage and inflicts Poison for 10 seconds.
- On Hard, sting deals 3damage and inflicts Poison for 18 seconds.

Bees have 10 health and can be killed with a single critical hit from any axe, or a non-critical hit from a maxed diamond sword.

### Nether mobs
#### Piglins

See also: Piglin

Piglins are hostile toward players if they are not wearing any gold armor. Even if you are wearing a piece of golden armor, piglins still become hostile if you break nether gold ore, gilded blackstone or gold blocks, or open/break containers, like chests, nearby them. All piglins in the proximity also become hostile when you attack one of them. Piglins use golden swords like zombified piglins or a crossbow like pillagers. They can spawn wearing gold armor. Their weapon and armor is sometimes enchanted.

Most piglins spawn in crimson forest biomes and inside bastion remnants. You must be aware of piglins while either exploring those, but as long as you wear at least one piece of gold armor on any armor slot, and don't break any gold-related blocks or open containers, piglins remain neutral. Piglins stay further away from zombified piglins and are always hostile to wither skeletons and withers. Piglins also flee from soul fire and blocks related to soul fire (soul lantern, soul torch and lit soul campfire).

Best strategy is to avoid angering piglins in the first place, as fighting a large group of them might be challenging, especially in bastions, where they are aided by piglin brutes. Killing one piglin is not difficult though, as they have only 16 × 8 health. Some methods to achieve the one-hit kill on unarmored piglins include:

- Netherite axe + Sharpness I + critical hit;
- Stone axe + Sharpness IV + critical hit;
- Strength I + netherite sword + critical hit;
- Strength I + netherite axe + Sharpness V;
- Strength II + stone sword + critical hit.

A lava bucket is also useful on piglins, as they are not immune to fire damage, unlike most other nether mobs.
