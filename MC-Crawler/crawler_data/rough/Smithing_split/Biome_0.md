# Biome
A biome is a region in a world with distinct geographical features, plants, temperatures, humidity levels, water colors, grass colors, and foliage colors. Biomes separate every generated world into different environments, such as forests, deserts and taigas.

The biome of a location is determined during world generation rather than current environment. Even if the player completely changes all the blocks in a large area to imitate the terrain of other biomes, the actual biomes in this area will not be affected. However, in Java Edition, the /fillbiome command can change the biome in an area.

Biomes can be located using the /locate biome command.

## List of biomes
### Biome types
In Java Edition, there are 64 different biome types: 53 for the Overworld, 5 for the Nether and 5 for the End, plus one used only for a superflat preset. In Bedrock Edition there are 86 biome types: 53 for the Overworld, 5 for the Nether, 1 for the End and 27 unused.

On this page, for convenience of description and reading, the biomes in Overworld are divided into 8 categories, which are not official. While in each category, biomes may be further divided into some sub-categories. Biomes in a sub-categories are placed in one page, such as plains and sunflower plains, and are described as variants on this wiki.

### Overworld
#### Non-land biomes
These biomes are used for the generation of oceans and mushroom fields. They are large, open biomes made entirely of water going up to y=63, with underwater relief on the sea floor, such as small mountains and plains, usually including gravel, dirt, and sand. Squids and fish spawn frequently in the water, and dolphins spawn in non-frozen ocean variants.

These biomes are further divided into three categories: oceans, deep oceans and mushroom fields.

| Ocean               | The basic ocean biome. Like its colder variants, its floor is largely made up of gravel; however patches of dirt, sand and clay can also appear. Seagrass, kelp, cod and salmon‌[Bedrock Edition  only] can spawn here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Ocean               |
| Deep Ocean          | A variant of the ocean biome. In deep ocean biomes, the ocean can exceed 30 blocks in depth, making it twice as deep as the normal ocean. The ground is mainly covered with gravel. Ocean monuments generate in deep oceans, meaning guardians, elder guardians, prismarine and sponges can spawn here. Underwater ravines often generate here, with the top layer of lava being replaced by magma block that create bubble columns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Deep ocean          |
| Warm Ocean          | A variant of the ocean biome, with light teal water at the surface. Like the lukewarm ocean, it has a floor made of sand and like all oceans, it is populated with seagrass. Pufferfish and tropical fish spawn here. Unlike other ocean biomes, warm oceans allow for the generation of coral reefs and sea pickles. Kelp cannot spawn here. It is the only ocean biome that does not have a deep equivalent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Warm ocean          |
| Lukewarm Ocean      | A variant of the Ocean biome, with light blue water at the surface. Its floor is made of sand with the occasional patch of dirt or clay. Kelp and seagrass spawn here. Unlike the warm ocean biome, cod and salmon‌[BE  only] can spawn here, together with pufferfishes‌[JE  only] and tropical fishes. Coral cannot spawn here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Lukewarm ocean      |
| Deep Lukewarm Ocean | Similar to the lukewarm ocean biome, but twice as deep. Because they are a deep ocean variant, they can generate ocean monuments, resulting in the spawning of guardians, elder guardians, prismarine and sponges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Deep lukewarm ocean |
| Cold Ocean          | A variant of the ocean biome, with dark blue water at the surface. Like regular oceans and frozen oceans, its floor is made up of gravel, though occasional patches of dirt can be found. Salmon are able to spawn in cold ocean biomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Cold ocean          |
| Deep Cold Ocean     | Similar to the cold ocean biome, but twice as deep. Like other deep oceans, ocean monuments are able to generate here, which contain guardians, elder guardians, prismarine and sponges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Deep cold ocean     |
| Frozen Ocean        | A variant of the ocean biome with dark indigo water at the surface. Like the cold ocean, it has a gravel seabed and squids swimming about. However, the water's surface is frequently broken up by patches of ice and large icebergs, consisting of packed ice and blue ice, and occasionally topped with snow blocks. Strays and polar bears can spawn here, but dolphins can't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Frozen ocean        |
| Deep Frozen Ocean   | Like the frozen ocean biome, the only fishes that spawn here are salmon and cod‌[BE  only], and the floor consists of gravel. The frozen deep ocean biome also contains ocean monuments and a deeper floor than normal oceans, like other deep oceans. Frequent floating icebergs with blue ice generate here. Polar bears, rabbits and strays can also spawn here, but dolphins can't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Deep frozen ocean   |
| Mushroom Fields     | This rare biome consists of a mostly flat island and has mycelium instead of grass as its surface. However, any grass placed appears in a bright green color, even brighter than in the jungle. Mushroom fields are always adjacent to a deep ocean and are isolated from other biomes, and they are typically a few hundred blocks wide. It is one of the few biomes where huge mushrooms can generate naturally, and where mushrooms can grow in full sunlight.No mobs other than mooshrooms spawn naturally in this biome, including the usual night-time hostile mobs. This also applies to caves, mineshafts and other dark structures, meaning exploring underground is safe. However, monster spawners still spawn mobs, wandering traders along with their llamas can spawn, raids can still spawn illagers, the player can still breed animals and spawn mobs using spawn eggs and insomnia still attracts phantoms. | Mushroom fields     |
