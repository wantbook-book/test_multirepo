### Hostile mobs
Weapons, tools, and armor dropped by mobs have at least 25 durability remaining, which is also the most common. Less-damaged items are increasingly rare.

Except for gold swords and tools, items always have at least 26 points of damage taken. Gold items can be dropped un-damaged.

The same type can be chosen multiple times, therefore it is possible to get 6 of a one item. Sticks are twice as likely to be dropped as the other common drops. Potions can be obtained only by killing the witch while it is drinking the potion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Yes                                                                    |
