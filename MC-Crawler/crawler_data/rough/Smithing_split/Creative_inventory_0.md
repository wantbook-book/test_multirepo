## General info
The player can pick up blocks from here to use endlessly. In the search tab found above the Creative inventory, players can search for the items they want to use. If the "Operator Items Tab" option in the controls menu is enabled, the Creative inventory shows operator items (like command blocks and barriers) in a separate tab.‌[JE  only]

## Java Edition
A single item can be grabbed also can be used by pressing shift 4 times in a row using left-click, increasing with continued left-clicks on that item. Left or right-clicking with an item or stack of items while hovering over any item other than the one held gets rid of the held item. Right-clicking an item also picks up one item, but the second click then puts it back down as opposed to picking up more. Shift-clicking an item grabs a full stack of items. Pressing a number key while hovering over an item instantly places one full stack of that item into the hotbar slot that corresponds with the number.

The Creative inventory screen is sorted into 11 sections: Building Blocks, Colored Blocks, Natural Blocks, Functional Blocks, Redstone Blocks, Tools & Utilities, Combat, Food & Drinks, Ingredients, Spawn Eggs, and Operator Utilities. The latter tab is available only if cheats are enabled and the "Operator Items Tab" option in the controls menu is turned on. Blocks are grouped by material and the same item can appear in multiple tabs, which the latter are indicated with an asterisk (*) below. In the case of the search tab, those that appear in multiple tabs are listed only once in the first section. There is also a  Search Items,  Saved Hotbars and  Survival Inventory tab. Wither and ender dragon spawn eggs, petrified oak slab, knowledge book, uncraftable potions and uncraftable tipped arrow are not obtainable in the Creative inventory.

Using the search tab, one can access enchanted books of any level, whereas only books of the maximum levels can be found in the Ingredients section.
