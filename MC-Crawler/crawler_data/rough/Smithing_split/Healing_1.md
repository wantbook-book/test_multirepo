## Mob healing
In contrast to the player, most mobs don't heal by themselves. Nevertheless, there are several ways to heal animals and monsters.

### Potions
Most mobs are healed by potions of Healing and Regeneration just like the player.

On the other hand, undead mobs take damage from these potions, and healing them requires a potion of Harming. Potions of Regeneration or Poison don't affect undead mobs at all.

### Regeneration
Rideable animals like horses, donkeys, mules, skeleton horses and llamas automatically regenerate at a slow rate of about 2 per minute.

### Axolotl
Axolotls may play dead when taking damage underwater, dropping to the ground for 10 seconds while regenerating.

### Spider
In Java Edition, spiders on Hard difficulty can spawn with permanent positive status effects, which can include Regeneration, making the spider gradually recover health.

### Villager
Villagers gain 10 seconds of regeneration when new trades are unlocked. 
Additionally in Bedrock Edition, villagers recover health when waking up from bed every morning.

### Iron golem
Iron golems can be healed using iron ingots by right-clicking on them, restoring their health by 25 × 12.5. This cannot be done using iron nuggets or iron blocks.

### Witch
Witches use potions of Healing to heal themselves. 
Additionally, witches throw splash potions of Healing or Regeneration at illagers during raids.‌[Java Edition  only]

### Feeding
Some animals can also be fed in order to recover a set amount of hitpoints. The following animals can be fed:

Feeding wolf pups not only restores lost health but can also increase their total health from the usual 8 up to a maximum of 20 × 10.

### Boss healing
#### Ender dragon
The ender dragon gets healed by the end crystals on the obsidian pillars in the End. If a crystal gets destroyed during the healing phase, though, the dragon takes 10             (5 hearts) damage instead.

#### Wither
The wither permanently regenerates its health. If an undead mob (including a wither) gets hit by a blue wither skull, they also get healed by the provided Wither effect.
