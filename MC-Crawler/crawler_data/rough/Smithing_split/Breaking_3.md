## Notes
1. ↑ a b c d e fThese blocks cannot be targeted (the block behind them is mined instead), so they cannot be broken, even though in code they have a finite hardness.
2. ↑The dragon egg can be mined directly only when there aren't any air blocks available for it to teleport to. However, the dragon egg can be collected by other means.
3. ↑No version exists with both netherite tools and this block, but the breaking speed can be inferred from hardness.
4. ↑ a b cChemistry tables are slow to break by hand, similar to blocks that require a pickaxe to mine. However, they still drop as items except the Lab Table.
5. ↑Leaves drop themselves only if destroyed via a silk touch-enchanted tool or shears; otherwise, they drop saplings and sticks, or apples if it is an oak tree.
6. ↑Grass drops itself only when broken with shears; using any other tool randomly drops seeds.
7. ↑ a bThese blocks have a 1⁄3 chance of dropping themselves.
