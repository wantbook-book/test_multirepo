##### Explosion mechanics
See also: Explosion

If there are 3 blocks or less between the player and the creeper, and it has a line-of-sight to the player (i.e. the player and the creeper can see each other's faces), mob starts its 1.5 second countdown before they explode. Hitting it and moving back or sprint-hitting it moves it far enough away that the countdown stops. Creepers running away from cats that have started their countdown can still explode if the player is close enough.

Image below shows the likelihood of a creeper exploding. The white square in the center with an 'X' is the creeper's location. This grid uses the block system for distance and it is used by 'placing' the player on the relative colored square. Please note that the player may think that they are two blocks away in the game, but actually, they may be closer, depending on the graphics or perspective (e.g. looking up vs. looking straight ahead).

##### Advanced techniques
One of the scariest things about the creeper is its silence while approaching. However, if you listen carefully, you might notice that the creeper has footstep sounds. Since the player also makes footstep sounds, it is hard to tell if a creeper is coming, or it is just the player's own footsteps. Luckily, player footstep sounds and creeper footstep sounds are not in the same category: the player's sounds are under the "Players" category, and the creeper's sounds are under the "Hostile Creatures" category. Therefore, by turning down the "Players" volume slider and increasing the "Hostile Creatures" volume, the footsteps of an approaching creeper can be much more recognizable. If you are wearing headphones, you can even identify the direction of the footsteps; this is also possible with subtitles. You can also sneak to prevent your character from making footsteps at all, so that when you hear footsteps, you can be certain that another mob is nearby.

Like with other mobs, you can place a boat in front of the creeper's path, so that it enterS the boat and IS unable to escape. You can then place a 2-block-high pillar next to the boat with the creeper inside, stand behind it, come out and hit the creeper, and retreat back behind the pillar when the creeper hisses. Repeat until the creeper dies.

If a creeper is encountered in a cave, you can run back and build a horizontal barrier with cheap blocks like dirt or cobblestone, at the second block space above the ground (i.e. at the player and creeper's eye height). When the creeper approaches, it won't explode because it does not have a direct line-of-sight with the player. You can then strike at the creeper's feet without worries, until it dies.

#### Witches

See also: Witch

Witches are hostile mobs with an appearance similar to villagers that spawn in raids, swamp huts and rarely during the night in the Overworld. They throw negative splash potions at the player and drink Water Breathing, Fire Resistance and Instant Health potions to protect themselves. Witches often start their attacks by throwing splash potions of Poison or Slowness, following up with Harming or Weakness. Their health is 26 × 13.

If you find one, shooting it with a bow is the safest bet. If you are holding a strong weapon, another strategy would be charging toward it and hitting it multiple times before the witch is finished drinking their potion of Instant Health.

In Java Edition, killing witches in one melee hit is barely possible with maxed weapon and buffs. Some ways to achieve the one-hit kill include:

- Strength I + netherite axe + Sharpness V + critical hit;
- Strength II + netherite axe + Sharpness III + critical hit.

Don't use splash potions on witches as they are almost completely immune. Fire attacks and lava are also negated through potions of Fire Resistance, although the time that it takes for them to drink this potion can give you some advantage. During raids, prioritize killing witches before other raiders to prevent them being healed.

#### Slimes

See also: Slime

Slimes are found only below altitude level 40 in certain chunks and in swamp biomes at night, but usually occur in large numbers, especially at full moon, and are often a major pest in mines. One solution to that problem is to mine a hole only one block wide so that only the harmless tiny slimes can fit in it, but in natural caves and larger mines slimes can become a nuisance as they spawn in any light level.

Small slimes have 1 point of health and can't deal any damage. Medium slimes have 4 points of health and they deal 2 damage on Easy and Normal, and 3 on Hard. Large slimes have 16 × 8 points of health and they deal 3 damage on Easy, 4 damage on Normal, and 6 damage on Hard.

Since medium slimes are slightly over 1 block wide, and large slimes are over 2 blocks wide, you can easily trap them behind walls and hit them. They are also easily killed by attacking from above. Attacking from above or backpedaling prevents too many from attacking at once. Water is also effective at slowing them down. 

Lava can kill large numbers of slimes, so it is good as a last resort or if you don't care about drops. Note that a tiny slime can be killed with just a fist punch, saving weapon durability. You could also use a sword's sweep attack (which deals 1 by default) in order to eliminate a number of tiny slimes at once ‌[Java Edition  only].
