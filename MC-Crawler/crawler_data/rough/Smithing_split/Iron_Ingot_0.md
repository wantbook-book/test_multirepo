### Mob loot
See also: Tutorials/Iron golem farming

Iron golems drop 3-5 iron ingots upon death, regardless of the way they die. The looting enchantment does not increase the amount of iron ingots dropped.

Zombies, husks, and zombie villagers have a 2.5% (1⁄40) chance of dropping either an iron ingot, carrot, or potato when killed by a player or tamed wolf. This is increased by 1% (1⁄100) per level of looting. This gives iron ingots the following chances of dropping:

- 1⁄120(about 0.83%)
- 7⁄600(about 1.17%) with Looting I
- 9⁄600(1.50%) with Looting II
- 11⁄600(about 1.83%) with Looting III
