## Natural regeneration
Natural healing can be deactivated using the command /gamerule naturalRegeneration false or from the world option.

### Hunger
Whenever a player's hunger is 18 ( × 9) or higher, they regenerate 1 every 4 seconds. This increases the player's exhaustion by 6, of which 4 cost 1 () hunger. If existing, the player's saturation is used up first.

### Saturation healing

  

This feature is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


If the player's hunger bar is completely filled and they have left over saturation, this saturation gets drained, healing at a rate of 2 every second. Just as with the hunger-based regeneration, every 1 regenerated deducts 1.5 saturation. With the maximum amount of 20 saturation, the player can rapidly regenerate up to 13 × 6.5.

### Peaceful difficulty
When the difficulty is set to Peaceful, the player regenerates at a standard rate of 1 per second, additionally with 1 every 4 seconds as the player's hunger bar is filled. Chorus fruit, golden apples, honey bottles, and suspicious stew can be eaten even when the hunger bar is full, increasing the player's regeneration even further. On the other hand, this also causes the player to lose saturation even when changing from other difficulty levels to Peaceful mode.

## Artificial regeneration
### Potions
The player can drink a potion to regain health immediately or over time.

#### Potion of Healing
The potion of Healing instantly regenerates 4. If it gets amplified with glowstone, this value increases to 8. In the upcoming Combat Tests, it instantly heals 6 per level.

In Bedrock Edition Adding gunpowder to make splash potion decreases its duration, making healing less effective. Splash potion of regeneration heals 1 every 2.5 seconds over 33 seconds, resulting in 13 × 6.5 in total. Amplifying the potion with glowstone increases this rate to 1 every 1.25 seconds for 0:16 seconds, whereas redstone increases the duration to 1:30 minutes, restores 36 × 18.

Adding Dragon Breath on splash potion to make lingering potion. Lingering potion of regeneration heals 1 every 2.5 seconds over 11 seconds, resulting in 4 in total. Amplifying the potion with glowstone increases this rate to 1 every 1.25 seconds for 0.5 seconds, whereas redstone increases the duration to 0:22‌[JE  only] / 0:30‌[BE  only] seconds, restores 8‌[JE  only]12 × 6‌[BE  only].

#### Tipped arrow
Tipped arrow shots from a bow, crossbow, or dispenser inflict arrow damage and a status effect. Arrows of healing give the same effect as its potion (4 for an arrow of healing I, and 8 for an arrow of healing II). Regeneration I arrows last 5 seconds (restores 2), the extended regeneration I arrows last 0:11‌[JE  only] / 0:15‌[BE  only] seconds (restores 4‌[JE  only] / 6‌[BE  only]), and arrows of regeneration II give regeneration II for 0:02 seconds (restores 2). However, arrow damage decreases or sometimes even nullifies the health recovered unless a weak bow shot is used or the player is wearing good armor.

### Golden apple
