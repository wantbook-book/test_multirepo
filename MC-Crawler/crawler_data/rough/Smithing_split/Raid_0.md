# Raid
A raid is an ominous event in which waves of various mobs, mainly illagers, spawn and attack a village. It is triggered when a player with the Raid Omen stays in a village and the effect ends.

## Spawning
A player with the Bad Omen status effect triggers a raid upon entering a chunk with at least one villager and a claimed bed, or one of the 8 chunks surrounding it in a square. In Java Edition, a villager with a claimed bell or job site block can also trigger a raid, even if no claimed beds are present.

Bad Omen is obtained when a player kills an illager captain, which can be found at pillager outposts, woodland mansions, in patrols or during raids, as long as they are killed outside the raid range. If a player kills multiple captains in Java Edition, the Bad Omen accumulates up to Bad Omen V, causing members of the raiding party to have an increased chance of having enchanted weapons. Killing a patrol captain gives 1–5 Bad Omen levels, while killing an outpost captain always gives 1 level. In Bedrock Edition, the Bad Omen effect does not stack by killing multiple captains.

Raids can be triggered in the Overworld and the End, but in Java Edition, raids cannot be triggered in the Nether.[1]

In Java Edition, raids can be disabled by setting the game rule disableRaids to true.

## Behavior
### Starting
In Java Edition, any subchunk containing a claimed POI (point of interest: a bed, job site, or bell) counts as a village. When a player with Bad Omen enters a 3×3×3 subchunk region around a village, the effect disappears and the raid starts. The raid center is initially the average position of all claimed POIs within 64 block radius of the player when the raid triggers. A bossbar labeled "Raid" appears and begins charging taking 15 seconds to complete; a villager runs to ring the bell and all other villagers within 96 blocks (spherical) from the raid center start panicking untill the bar is full. The bossbar is visible to players up to 96 blocks away (spherical) from the raid center. The bar is red and represents the total remaining health of the raid mobs (each segment is 1/10 of the bar). The number of mobs still alive displays when there are fewer than three. Raid waves spawn some distance away from the raid center and navigate toward it. A horn sounds at the start of each wave, from the direction of the wave spawn and 13 blocks away from the player. Raid waves try to spawn in the same place, unless a player is too close. Each subsequent wave is larger, with more mobs, including pillagers, witches, evokers, ravagers, and vindicators. If during the course of the raid, all the POIs inside the subchunk around the raid center are lost (either because the villagers are killed or the blocks themselves are somehow destroyed), the raid center moves to the center of the nearest subchunk that still counts as a village within the surrounding 5×5×5 subchunk region (if there are none, the raid ends in defeat for the player).

In Bedrock Edition, when a player with Bad Omen enters a 64×23×64 region around a village center (technically 1.12 blocks below the center), the effect disappears and the raid starts. A bossbar labeled "Raid" appears and begins charging. The bossbar is visible in a 128×88×128 region around the village center (technically 1.12 blocks below the center). The bar is red, and represents the number of remaining mobs. While a wither is already present in the village and a raid starts, the bar is red and black. The number of mobs still alive displays when there are fewer than three. A horn sounds at the start of each wave, and plays again at intervals until the wave has been defeated, or the player has lost. The horn plays from the direction of one of the illagers, which can help players locate it. The bell rings while the bossbar charges. Each subsequent wave is larger, with more mobs, including pillagers, witches, evokers, ravagers, and vindicators.

### Joining
Illagers, ravagers and witches not spawned as part of the raid (e.g. from a patrol) may join the raid and be counted by the bossbar, provided they are within 96 blocks of the raid center. 

In Java Edition, illusioners can also join the raid. Raid captains may also join and can trigger a new raid when killed far enough from the village. Raiders leave the raid if they are more than 112 blocks away from the raid center or haven't seen action in a while.

### Illager
Illagers have exclusive behavior during raids. 

In Java Edition, vindicators in a raid take the initiative to open and close doors to search for villagers. They can sometimes break a wooden door in Normal [verify] or Hard difficulty if they cannot open the door normally. Evokers and illusioners gain extra movement speed without any effects. This causes evokers to sprint much faster than the player. Evokers exhibit normal attack behavior, but if they do not have a target, they sprint back and forth.

In Bedrock Edition, a vindicator spawned in a raid gains the ability to break doors in Normal difficulty, but does not actively seek doors. They try to break the door only when passing by.
