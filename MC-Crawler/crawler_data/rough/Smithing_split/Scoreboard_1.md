##### Compound criteria
Compound criteria's names are divided into parts, delimited with periods (.). For example,minecraft.killed_by:minecraft.zombieis a valid compound criteria, under which player scores would increment whenever they're killed by zombie.
All objectives based on compound criteria is writable and can be modified with commands.
Allstatisticscan be used as a compound criteria whose name is itsidentifier. Player statistics are stored separately from the scoreboard, and as they update, scores in these objectives are updated in parallel.
In addition, there are some other compound criteria:

#### Bedrock Edition
Currently, "dummy" is the only criteria supported. As such, score can be changed only by commands.

## Display slots
An objective with two points to the player is displayed in the "list" slot, while an objective with the display name "Quest Points" with 0 points to the player is displayed in the "sidebar" slot.
Via the /scoreboard objectives setdisplay command (see command reference), players' scores in specific objectives can be displayed in certain 'slots' in-game. Each 'display slot' can show one objective at a time, and multiple 'display slots' may be used for the same or different objectives.

## Tags
Main article: Commands/tag
Tags are a simple list of single-word strings stored directly in the  Tags data tag of an entity. As with objectives, tags are case-sensitive.

Target selectors can be used to check whether an entity has a tag with the "tag" argument.

## Teams
"team" redirects here.  For the command, see Commands/team.

  

This feature is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


Team is a list of entities that can be used by mapmakers or server operators to group entities or players together as an ally.

Entity can have only one team; team cannot share with other different team member. If a player is teamed with a hostile entity, that entity does not attack the player. This unique behavior is also apparent with a neutral entity who would normally attack hostile entities, like the Iron Golem.

Team has a name property, used internally for reference in commands, target arguments, and the file format. It is a single, case-sensitive text. Team also has other several properties to customize its appearance and behavior:

Commands can be used to check whether team members exist by using target selection with the "team" argument. (The '!' character may be placed before a name to check for entities not on a team.) For example, inputting /execute if entity @a[team=red] into a command block provides comparator output if any player exists on the red team. Conversely, /execute if entity @a[team=!red] provides output when there are any players not on the red team. /execute if entity @a[team=!] allows output when at least one player is on any team, and /execute if entity @a[team=] allows output when at least one player is on no team.
