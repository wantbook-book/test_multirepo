### Upgrading
Like other diamond tools, a diamond hoe can be upgraded to a netherite hoe, increasing its durability and slightly increasing its mining speed, as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item.

A hoe can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the hoe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two hoes of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the hoe's enchantments.
