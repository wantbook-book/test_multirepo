## Glowing text
Comparison of all the dyed glowing texts.
Glow Ink Sac applied on a sign causes a character to create eight copies of itself in all eight directions. This results in the font appearing to have a thick outline. Glowing text always renders with an emissive texture, so it appears bright in darkness. The text takes priority over the outline; outlines appear below a character's pixels if they conflict.  However, it is a rendering effect that does not actually emit any light. The player can use a black ink sac on the sign to remove the glow.

In a sign's block data,  front_text or  back_text's  has_glowing_text controls whether the text glows.
