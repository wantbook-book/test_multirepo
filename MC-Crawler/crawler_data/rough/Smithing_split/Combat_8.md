#### Wither skeletons

See also: Wither Skeleton

Wither skeletons are the Nether equivalent of skeletons. Unlike normal skeletons, they use melee attacks. Wither skeletons attack with a stone sword and give players the Wither effect for 10 seconds upon damaging them. Wither skeletons spawn only in nether fortresses, just like blazes. They can spawn with pumpkins on Halloween‌[Java Edition  only], and can sometimes pick up armor and weapons, but they cannot pick up blocks or items.

Wither skeletons deal medium damage (Easy: 5, Normal: 8, Hard: 12 × 6), but the added Wither effect makes them a much bigger threat. This effect can kill you, unlike Poison, and unenchanted armor does not protect against it (although armor enchanted with Protection does), so even if you escape the enemy, you might still die from withering.

Wither skeletons are exactly 2.4 blocks tall, but their pathfinding works as if they were just 2 blocks tall. This provides some safe tactics for combating them: you can build a 2 block high space, where it is safe to hide upon engaging a wither skeleton. They rarely (2.5% chance) drop wither skeleton skulls used to summon the wither. A sword enchanted with Looting increases the chance to drop a skull up to 5.5%.

The Smite enchantment can deal high damage to them, due to wither skeletons being undead. Stone axe (or better) with Smite V kills wither skeletons in one hit, without the need of criticals or Strength effect. A shield can also be useful, as it completely blocks their hits, including the Wither effect. If you don't have a strong melee weapon, you can also shoot wither skeletons with a ranged weapon, like a bow, but note that this doesn't apply Looting, so shooting them is not recommended if you are trying to gather skulls.

#### Hoglins

See also: Hoglin

Hoglins are hostile toward players when encountered, but enter a "scared" state when being in proximity of a warped fungus, a nether portal or a respawn anchor. In this state, hoglins don't attack players and try to run away from the block that is scaring them. Piglins sometimes hunt and kill hoglins, so they might be an ally when fighting these mobs.

Hoglins spawn in crimson forest biome and in some bastion remnants. They have 40 × 20 of health and can't be killed in one melee hit (using weapons and buffs obtainable in Survival), but can be killed in two, if a strong weapon and Strength effect is used. They deal medium damage, but very high knockback, which might be more dangerous than the attack itself. Knockback can throw you high in the air and not always away from the hoglin. Being kicked off a cliff to a sea of lava is not unlikely if you encounter a pack of hoglins. It's recommended to bring a potion of Fire Resistance to the Nether anyway, but even more so when you're dealing with hoglins; boots enchanted with Feather Falling may also help, reducing received fall damage.

Carrying a warped fungus protects you in most circumstances, but keep in mind that you can place it only on nylium. Carrying a respawn anchor seems to be a better solution, as you can place it anywhere, but breaking it requires a diamond pickaxe or better, takes a lot of time, and the biome that hoglins spawn in is covered in nylium anyway. Therefore having a warped fungus as a method to scare hoglins away is usually a good strategy.

Hoglins have another weakness: large hitbox. They can't fit in 1-block-wide gaps, which makes trapping them relatively easy. Also, hoglins are not immune to lava, so a lava bucket can be used as a weapon against them. Otherwise, you can use melee and ranged weaponry as on most mobs.

#### Zoglins

See also: Zoglin

If a hoglin enters the Overworld, it becomes a zoglin, similar how a piglin transforms into a zombified piglin. Zoglins are hostile to all mobs (and players), with the exception of creepers and other zoglins. If they appear in your base, where you gathered lots of other mobs, zoglins start a killing spree, so you want to slay them ASAP.

Zoglins can't be scared with warped fungi, nether portals or respawn anchors. Like hoglins, they can attack and fling you in the air. They deal the same damage and have the same health as hoglins, but zoglins are classified as undead mobs, which can make the Smite enchantment very useful. Unfortunately, killing them in one melee hit is still impossible, even though Smite deals more damage to them than Sharpness. If you drink a potions of Strength II and strike a critical hit on the zoglin with a netherite axe enchanted with Smite V, mob survives with 3.5 × 1.75.

Zoglins are immune to lava and fire, but are still easy to trap, because their hitbox is the same as hoglins. 

#### Piglin brutes

See also: Piglin Brute

Piglin brutes are much stronger variants of piglins that spawn with no armor and a golden axe. They ignore gold armor on players and gold ingots dropped on the ground, and are not scared of soul fire-related blocks or zombified piglins. Piglin brutes have 50 × 25 HP and only spawn in generated bastion remnant structures. Piglin brute's melee attack is one of the strongest in the game, matching vindicator's attack: they deal 7.5 × 3.75 damage on Easy, 13 × 6.5 on Normal and 19.5 × 9.75 on Hard, almost enough to kill unarmored players in one hit.

Bastions are a much more dangerous place since version Java Edition 1.16.2/Bedrock Edition 1.16.20, which added piglin brutes. If you get cornered in a tight corridor with few brutes attacking, you are very likely to die even with strong gear. If you are not a skilled player, enchanted diamond or netherite armor with Protection IV enchantment is recommended, along with a strong diamond or netherite sword with Sharpness V, and a few totems of undying. Due to their high health it's impossible to slay piglin brutes in one melee hit, and even doing so in two hits requires a maxed axe and Strength II effect. You should also carry some blocks in your hotbar to block off corridors.

If you approach a bastion and see piglin brutes already angered at you, it might be a good idea to kill them with a ranged weapon before going inside.

A lava bucket is very effective against brutes, as they are not immune to fire damage, but it still takes a while to kill them. Lava is a good weapon of choice for another reason, too: killing piglin brutes with lava does not anger normal piglins, which are wandering around the bastion as well.
