## Modifying game rules
The "Edit Game Rules" section of the "Create World" screen on Java Edition.
In Java Edition, game rules can be changed using toggle buttons on the "Edit Game Rules" menu built into the "Create World" screen. The game rules are split into categories named "Player", "Mobs", "Spawning", "Drops", "World updates", "Chat", and "Miscellaneous".

In Bedrock Edition, about half of the game rules can be changed using toggles on the "World settings" and "Cheats" sections of the world's Game settings screen. The remainder can be changed only with commands.

When in-game, game rules can be changed using the /gamerule command, using the syntax /gamerule <rule> [<value>], where <rule> is the name of the game rule and <value> is an allowed value, which depends on the type of the game rule. The types are boolean (where the allowed values are either true or false) and integer (where any whole number is able to be entered).

## List of game rules
The following is a list of game rules available in-game, their allowed values, and their availability in Java Edition and Bedrock Edition.
