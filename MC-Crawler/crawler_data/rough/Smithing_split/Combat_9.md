### End mobs
Besides the dragon (see below), only two mobs spawn naturally in the End. One of them is hostile and the other one is neutral. Endermites don't spawn naturally but they share similarities with the End mobs.

#### Endermites

See also: Endermite

If the player uses ender pearls often, they are sure to come across an endermite at some point. Endermites are not very difficult to fight as they have only 8, just like silverfish, and are more of a nuisance than a hazard.

If you don't want to bother with killing an endermite, go to at least 16 blocks away from it so that it won't attack you, and it despawns after 2 minutes. If you want to kill an endermite for its experience, it's not too difficult. Just get a sword or axe of any type, and keep hitting it until it's dead. If you use a stone or better axe ‌[Java Edition  only], or a diamond sword enchanted with Sharpness, you are able to kill the endermite in one hit. Endermen are also hostile toward endermites, which can spark some rather comedic battles.

#### Shulkers

See also: Shulker

Shulkers only appear in end cities. They shoot shulker bullets that follow their target. If a player gets hit by a shulker bullet, they get the Levitation effect for 10 seconds. This can make travelling to the top rooms in the end city and end ship easier, but also creates a risk of taking fall damage. Bullets also deal 4 damage and can be a real threat by themselves, even ignoring damage from falling.

To counteract the Levitation, you can use Slow Falling potions, boots enchanted with Feather Falling and water buckets, as being in water completely negates the effect. To counteract bullet damage, you can use a shield or punch/shoot the bullet, which disappears immediately. Armor enchanted with Protection or Projectile Protection helps in reducing the damage as well.

Shulkers have 30 × 15 health and are impossible to kill in one melee hit using weapons and buffs obtainable in Survival. Additionally, they often hide in their shells, which give them 10 armor points and make arrows shot at them bounce off. Do not shoot a shulker which hides in its shell, especially if you are right next to it, as the arrow bounces off the shell and can damage you instead! To kill shulkers effectively, you can time the shots with the shulker opening its shell, or take advantage of the Levitation and hit them with a sword while floating up toward them.

Shulkers are not immune to their own projectile and can even kill each other, if too many shulkers in one area start shooting bullets. However, when low on health, they have a chance to teleport to another location.

An effective way to kill shulkers in tight, tall spaces is using explosions from firework rockets, either placed on the ground or shot from crossbows.

### Bosses
Currently there are two bosses in Minecraft: the ender dragon and the wither. Both bosses have their own tutorials, covering combat strategies in much greater detail. Here they are described briefly. 

#### Ender dragons

See also: Ender Dragon

Main article: Tutorials/Defeating the Ender Dragon
Ender dragons spawn naturally (when the player enters the End for the first time) or can be respawned by placing 4 end crystals on the exit portal. They have 200 × 100 health, one of the highest in Minecraft, use both a melee and a ranged attack, and can destroy most blocks in the game.

Throughout the years, many strategies on defeating the main boss of Minecraft were created. A skilled player can kill it with only a handful of explosives, which often include beds, as those explode in the End just like in the Nether. If however you are a beginner, it is recommended to prepare at least some diamond armor and a diamond sword, as well as a good bow. Standard enchantments like Protection, Sharpness and Power can help. 

First, you need to destroy all end crystals located on top of obsidian towers, as those heal the dragon. You can either shoot them with a bow/crossbow/snowballs, or punch them directly, but be aware that an end crystal explodes violently when destroyed. Once all crystals are gone, you can start shooting the boss itself, or attacking it with a sword. The ender dragon approaches the exit portal from time to time, allowing successful melee attacks, however it knocks back any entities that are near its head or wings.

Other helpful strategies:

- set yourspawn pointclose to the end portal in stronghold;
- bring acarved pumpkininstead of a helmet, as there are lots ofendermenand the pumpkin stops them from becoming hostile when looked at;
- brewSlow Fallingpotions to counteract fall damage, as the dragon can throw you very high up in the air. Alternatively bring ahay baleor awater bucketif you have good reflexes;
- enchant your bow withInfinityif you don't have a good source of arrows;
- get someender pearlsfor emergency, e.g. when the dragon kicks you off the island;
- if you need to go on top of an obsidian tower, build a spiral staircase around it withend stone, as ender dragon can't destroy that block.

When the ender dragon is killed, it plays a unique death animation, drops experience points and opens the exit portal.

#### Withers

See also: Wither

Main article: Tutorials/Defeating the wither
Withers can be summoned by making a "T" shape with soul sand and placing 3 wither skeleton skulls on top. After the last skull was placed, wither is summoned, but is invulnerable for 11 seconds. After this time, it creates a very powerful explosion around itself and then it can be damaged.

Withers have from 300 × 150 to 600 × 300 health, depending on edition of the game and difficulty, and shoot black or blue skulls that can inflict the Wither effect. Blue skulls are also able to destroy any block obtainable in Survival mode: only indestructible blocks, like bedrock, can withstand them. Withers can fly and are immune to fire/lava damage, drowning, freezing and all status effects except for Instant Health (which damages them) and Instant Damage (which heals them). Withers are hostile not only to players, but also to all other mobs except undead and ghasts.

Wither's behavior and traits vary greatly between Java Edition and Bedrock Edition, and depending on difficulty:

- InJava Edition, withers always have 300× 150. Upon noticing a target, wither flies above it and starts shooting black and blue skulls. It tries to keep vertical distance between itself and its target, thus it is very difficult to strike it with a sword or axe.
	- On Easy, wither's skulls deal 5on impact and don't inflict the Wither effect.
	- On Normal, they deal 8and inflict Wither II for 10 seconds.
	- On Hard, they deal 12× 6and inflict Wither II for 40 seconds.
	- If wither's health is depleted below 150× 75, it creates an armor around itself, which is impenetrable to projectiles. From this point, wither can be damaged only by melee attacks and explosions. At this point, wither also stops flying high up in the air, and instead hovers low enough to be striked with a melee weapon.
	- A simple strategy to defeat the wither inJava Editionis to dig a long tunnel inOverworldin stone or deepslate, and summon the wither at the end of the tunnel. It's easy to shoot the boss through the hole due to it's predictable behavior, and once it gains armor, finishing it with a sword shouldn't take long.
	- A bow enchanted withPower+ a stack of arrows, a sword withSmite, diamond armor withProtectionand some good food, likegolden carrots, should be enough to defeat the wither.

- InBedrock Edition, wither's health varies with difficulty. Upon noticing a target, wither flies to a random nearby location and shoots skulls from there. Skulls deal the same damage as inJava Editionand they inflict the same length of Wither effect, but due to slower health regeneration of players, surviving the damage from withering is much more challenging.
	- On Easy, withers have 300× 150.
	- On Normal, withers have 450× 225. At half health, in addition to the wither armor, it explodes again and summons threewither skeletons.
	- On Hard, withers have 600× 300(more than awarden). At half health, in addition to the wither armor, it explodes again and summons three wither skeletons.
	- Below half health, wither changes the battle strategy and dashes towards its target, shooting bursts of skulls. Dash attack usually destroys large amounts of blocks, which drop as items: this can cause performance issues if the fight is long enough.
	- The "tunnel" strategy described above doesn't work as good withBedrock Editionwither, due to it's unpredictable behavior and dash attacks.
	- Maxed gear possible is recommended: bow withPowerV andInfinity, netherite sword withSmiteV, netherite armor withProtectionIV,golden apples, potions ofStrength,SpeedandRegeneration, somemilk bucketsto cure the withering effect, andtotems of undying.
	- After being defeated, wither explodes for a final time.
