## Modifiers
Modifiers act upon the base value of an attribute, increasing or decreasing it. Note that the resulting value after modification is capped by the attribute's minimum and maximum. Like attributes, modifiers have a name, however, this name does not define the modifier's behavior. Instead, a modifier's behavior is determined by its operation. Modifiers also carry an amount to their modification, and a UUID to uniquely identify the modifier.

### Operations
A modifier's operation dictates how it modifies an attribute's base value. Three operations exist:

add (amount +/-): Saved as operation 0. Adds all of the modifiers' amounts to the current value of the attribute. For example, modifying an attribute with {Amount:2,Operation:0} and {Amount:4,Operation:0} with a Base of 3 results in 9 (3 + 2 + 4 = 9).

multiply_base (amount % +/-, additive): Saved as operation 1. Multiplies the current value of the attribute by (1 + x), where x is the sum of the modifiers' amounts. For example, modifying an attribute with {Amount:2,Operation:1} and {Amount:4,Operation:1} with a Base of 3 results in 21 (3 * (1 + 2 + 4) = 21).

multiply (amount % +/-, multiplicative): Saved as operation 2. For every modifier, multiplies the current value of the attribute by (1 + x), where x is the amount of the particular modifier. Functions the same as Operation 1 if there is only a single modifier with operation 1 or 2. However, for multiple modifiers it multiplies the modifiers rather than adding them. For example, modifying an attribute with {Amount:2,Operation:2} and {Amount:4,Operation:2} with a Base of 3 results in 45 (3 * (1 + 2) * (1 + 4) = 45).[5]

The mathematical behavior is as follows:

- add: Increment X by Amount
- multiply_base: Increment Y by X * Amount
- multiply: Y = Y * (1 + Amount) (equivalent to Increment Y by Y * Amount).

The game first sets X = Base, then executes all Operation add, then sets Y = X, then executes all multiply_base modifiers, and finally executes all multiply modifiers.

### Vanilla modifiers
As stated before, a modifier's name can be anything, and this does not affect its behavior. The following are known modifier names and values used in vanilla Minecraft. Note that some UUIDs are generated on-the-fly, while others are represented as fixed strings in the code - these have been listed as well. If a UUID is not listed, this means that it is different every time the modifier is created.
