## Notes
1. ↑An eye of ender requires blaze powder to craft, which can be crafted only from blaze rods; but a blaze rod can be obtained only as a drop from a blaze, which is a hostile mob that cannot spawn in Peaceful.
2. ↑Since each end portal frame has a 1⁄10 chance of being filled, there is a (1⁄10)12 = 1⁄1 trillion chance of all 12 end portal frames being filled.
3. ↑Mobs accept fall damage if their health would not be reduced below 33% of their maximum health (rounded up to the nearest 1), plus a constant reserve based on difficulty. This even applies to ground-based mobs immune to fall damage.
