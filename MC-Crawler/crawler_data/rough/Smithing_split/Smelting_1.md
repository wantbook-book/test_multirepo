## Recipes
All smelting recipes can be used in the furnace, but only subsets are available in the blast furnace and smoker. When available, they burn twice as fast (5 seconds or 100 game ticks), but use the same amount of fuel.

For fractional experience values, first multiply this value by the number of smelted items removed from the furnace, then award the player the whole-number part, and if there is a fractional part remaining, this represents the chance of an additional experience point.

- For example, when smelting 1coal oreand removing the coal, the value is 0.1, so every ten coal you remove grants you one experience point on average.
- When smelting 5sea picklesand removing all 5lime dye, the value is 0.2×5 = 1, so this grants only 1 point.
- The fractional experience stays within the furnace when the final total is not an integer, so the leftover experience is attributed to the next round of smelting.

### Foods
All food recipes can be used in a furnace or smoker. Food can alternatively be cooked on a campfire, which doesn't require any fuel and takes 30 seconds or 600 game ticks to cook an item, which is faster (when cooking at the maximum capacity of 4 items at a time) than a furnace, but this doesn't award any experience and is slower than a smoker.

The following additional ores can be smelted, but it's more efficient to mine them with an appropriate pickaxe. In most cases mining them saves fuel and yields more product and experience, especially if the pickaxe has a Fortune enchantment. Smelting them, though, allows obtaining them from an automatic device. The ore blocks themselves can be obtained only via the Silk Touch enchantment.
