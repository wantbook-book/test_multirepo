## Materials
There are currently seven armor materials in the game: leather, chainmail, iron, gold, diamond, netherite, and turtle. The armor material of an item determines its durability multiplier, armor values, enchantability, sound events, toughness, knockback resistance, and repair items.

2. ↑Referred to as both "chain" and "chainmail" in the code.
3. ↑Although the turtle material is currently used only by turtle shells, it has unused protection values for other armor slots.
