## Control
Entering swim mode.
Exiting swim mode.
Swimming is activated by pressing forward while in water.

Sprint-swimming can also be activated. To do this, the player can press sprint for 1 block gap while moving, or double tap forward. The player cannot sprint-swim if the hunger bar is at 6 () or below, or when affected by Blindness.

Sneaking when swimming allows the player to sink faster.

## Usage
When swimming on the surface of still water, the player moves at 2.20 blocks per second. If the player is partially submerged in water, the player moves at 1.97 blocks per second. The player moves at 1.81 blocks per second when swimming downstream underwater, and moves at a slower 0.39 blocks per second while swimming upstream underwater.

### Sprint-swimming

Sprint-swimming allows the player to move at around 5.612 meters/second, which is 30 percent faster than the normal walking speed of around 4.317 m/s. The player can turn while sprint-swimming at a slightly reduced speed.

Sneaking while sprint-swimming allows the player to descend faster, and jumping allows the player to ascend faster. Therefore, the fastest way to descend underwater is to look directly downward, sprint-swim and sneak at the same time, and the fastest way to ascend underwater is to look directly upward, sprint-swim and jump at the same time. 

With sprinting while swimming, it is possible to swim across the water horizontally.[1] This allows the player to fit through one-block gaps, in a similar method to crawling.

By maneuvering the angle of swimming, it is possible to sprint-swim at the surface of a body of water, while still being able to breathe. 

Sprint-swimming reduces the player's saturation, and upon reaching zero it depletes the hunger bar at a rate of 1⁄2 every 40 meters, or 7 seconds.

When a player attacks any mob (excluding squid) while sprint-swimming, the mob suffers a larger knockback than usual.

Sprint-swimming, like normal sprinting, ends when the player collides with a solid block, sneaks, blocks or attacks a mob. Additionally, sprint-swimming also ends if the hunger bar decreases to 6 () or below.
