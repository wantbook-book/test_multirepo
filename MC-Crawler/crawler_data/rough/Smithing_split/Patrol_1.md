### Bad Omen
Main article: Bad Omen
Upon killing a patrol captain (either directly or when a tamed wolf kills it), the player receives the Bad Omen effect for 100 minutes, which has no consequences unless the player enters a village. Upon entering a village, the effect is removed from the player and a raid spawns nearby after about five seconds. In Java Edition, the level of the Bad Omen determines the chance of enchantment on raid members' weapons and additional waves. The number of waves depends on the difficulty. In Bedrock Edition, killing multiple pillager captains does not grant another level of Bad Omen, and does not increase the chance of raiding mobs yielding enchanted weapons. The Bad Omen effect can be removed by drinking milk, entering a village (which will trigger a Raid), waiting until the effect is over, or the player's death.
