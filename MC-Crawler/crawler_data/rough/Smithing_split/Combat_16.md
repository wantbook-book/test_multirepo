### End Crystal
- Style: Offensive,explosive
- Range: ~7 block radius
- Damage: Up to ? hearts to all entities in range

This is an even more powerful weapon that can kill a player in Protection IV armor quickly. Simply place down a block of obsidian, place the end crystal on top, and shoot it/hit it. Be aware that in order to deal the maximum damage from the end crystal, your opponent must be in the same y level as the crystal or higher. You can do this by hitting them and then place and destroy the crystal quickly or just wait for them to be on a higher y levels than you. Unfortunately end crystals are expensive to craft, and can only be placed on obsidian or bedrock. This can also be used to kill wardens with some difficulty.

### 
- Style: Contact, lasting
- Range: Damage on contact
- Damage:1⁄2heart per second, while lit

Flint and steel is a unique weapon, as players can set a block of fire, and while it burns, any mob that comes into contact with it will catch fire, suffering burn damage over time. This can be very useful when being chased by multiple mobs, as it will weaken all or most of them down to the point where a sword hit or two will be enough to kill them. However, there are several downsides to this method. First of all, mobs may elude the fire by pure luck, requiring another light. Second of all, if the player are in a confined space, circling to avoid mobs, they could potentially set the player on fire by accident. Third, burning mobs can also set themselves on fire when through melee attacks. Lastly, it can take a long time for the mob to die, enough time for more mobs to join the party. A fast player could make a short 1-block netherrack wall and light the top. Mobs would have to jump and they would take damage instantly or over time. Particularly effective with a sword with the Knockback enchantment.

###    Solid blocks
- Style: Defensive, assisting
- Range: within reach
- Damage: None

Blocks—the central element of the game—can become powerful tools of defense when used in the hands of skilled players. They can be used to elevate the player quickly from the ground by pillar jumping, block pathways to stop approaching hostile mobs, cut line-of-sight to prevent hostile mobs from noticing or attacking, or shield the player from explosions. 

Good candidates include dirt, cobblestone and netherrack. All of which are cheap, available in large quantities, can be quickly broken with basic tools, and are not affected by fire or gravity. When in areas without fire hazards, planks and leaves can also be considered.

### Sand or Gravel
- Style: Ambush, lasting
- Range: Unlimited
- Damage: From suffocating

Sand or gravel aren't weapons in true sense, but they can be used to kill mobs. Best use is in caves — when the player are on a high place and the player have a mob directly below, they can place that block on a wall near where they are standing; the block will fall, and with right aim, it will fall on the mob, and thus suffocate it. However, killing with this weapon doesn't yield any experience, but that block will make the mob stuck, and the player can finish them with the sword.

### Cactus
- Style: Defensive, trap
- Range: 1 block
- Damage: Contact (0.5 heart)

Cacti can be used to make effective traps against mobs. When in contact with the block, any mob (including the player) will lose half a heart every half seconds, however, mobs may avoid them, but if the player wants to make a trap, the player can place three cacti plants, two blocks high, in a V format. The player might want to lure them nearby (around 10 blocks far from the trap) and hide in the opposite side, where they will try pursue players but will not be able to reach.

### Cobweb
- Style: Defensive, trap
- Range: 1 block
- Damage: None

Cobwebs can be used to greatly impair enemy movement and makes any mobs stuck in it easier to hit. Players can acquire cobwebs from mineshafts, stronghold libraries, igloo basements, abandoned villages, and woodland mansion spider rooms. If players are running away or an enemy is approaching, they can place cobwebs in their path. Even if they don't run into it, they will still have to waste precious time going around and there is also the chance of them accidentally stepping into it while fighting players. Furthermore, intentionally placing and jumping into cobwebs may be a viable strategy, as players can repeatedly perform critical hits with melee weapons so long as all other criteria is met. 

And not only that, but you can trap enemies with cobwebs. When the enemy is standing still, quickly block them into a box, and put cobwebs in there. Then you may kill them. And if it is a player, they will also need to break out.

### Snowball
- Style: Assistive, hindering
- Range: Ranged, up to approx. 50 blocks depending on the aim
- Damage: None (except for blazes)

Snowballs may seem a useless weapon at first, as they deal no damage against mobs other than blazes. They have their use however because of their two important traits. First, they push a mob backward just as any hit does even despite the lack of damage. Then, unlike arrows snowballs can be fired as quickly as the player can right-click. This allows them to be used to keep even large amounts of approaching mobs at bay with relative ease or to quickly interrupt a mob's attack when necessary. This speed combined with the fact that snow is abundant in certain biomes, renewable and easily gathered makes it a cheaply obtained and useful long or short-range option, even after a bow has been located.

Not only that, but you can get a cool combo with snowballs. Shoot the snowball, and when the enemy is in the air, start comboing them.
