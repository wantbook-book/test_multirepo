#### Skeleton horsemen

See also: Skeleton Horse

The skeleton horsemen can rarely spawn during thunderstorms in groups of four. The skeleton riders, always equipped with an enchanted bow and enchanted iron helmet, move as fast as a horse but despawn after several minutes.

It is highly recommended that you use a ranged weapon to kill these horsemen, since multiple skeletons riding horses with enchanted bows are hard to reach. The horse itself is actually passive, so you just need to kill the rider and you get the skeleton horse as a result, a very valuable mount.

#### Breezes

Breezes spawn exclusively in trial chambers. They are not a dangerous enemy on their own, as their projectile attack deals only 1 damage on Easy and Normal, and 1.5 × 0.75 on Hard. What makes a battle with breeze much more challening is the environment of trial chambers: other mobs (zombies, skeletons, spiders, slimes etc.) and countless traps that the breeze can activate from a distance.

Breezes have 30 × 15 points of health and they can't be killed in one melee hit in Survival mode. Breezes bounce back all projectiles shot at them: arrows, tridents, fireworks or wind charges shot by players. The only exception are their own wind charges, which can be bounced back at the attacking breeze and damage it; however, this method is extremely difficult and ineffective. A good sword or axe with Sharpness is a better choice, but note that this mob is very agile, can jump high and far, making it difficult to land a hit.

Lava kills breezes relatively easily, but doesn't slow them down as much as most other mobs.

#### Wardens

See also: Warden

See also: Tutorials/Exploring an ancient city

Unlike any other hostile mob in the game, the warden is designed to be almost unkillable and not meant to be fought. There are no gains for players in fighting wardens, and warden encounter is systematically not a situation where combat is relevant. Players should not try to attack a warden in any circumstances, unless they want a very difficult challenge. If the player happens to kill a warden, they only drop a sculk catalyst and 5 experience.

If, for any reason, you decide to kill a warden, be warned that they are near impossible to slay. Wardens have 500 × 250 HP, which is the most health any mob has in Java Edition and second only to the wither in Bedrock Edition on Hard difficulty. Wardens are immune to fire and lava, take no knockback and deal enormous melee damage (16 × 8 on Easy, 30 × 15 on Normal, 45 × 22.5 on Hard). They also have a powerful ranged sonic boom attack, which deals 6 damage on Easy, 10 on Normal and 15 × 7.5 on Hard. Additionally, wardens inflict Darkness effect on all nearby players, which greatly reduces their vision. 

It might seem like keeping a medium distance to the warden is a good idea, because ranged attack deals much less damage than melee hits. However, armor and Protection enchantment reduce the damage taken from warden's melee attack, while sonic boom completely bypasses both.

If you are fast and in a good spot, you can pillar up 25 blocks and shoot the warden from above, as this is too far for its ranged attack. Note that even a bow with Power V takes 20+ arrow shots to kill it.

Trying to defeat the warden in melee combat is strongly discouraged, but, if you dare to challenge yourself with it, you should be prepared with best gear possible:

- Full netherite armor withProtectionIV andUnbreakingIII (warden's melee hits lower the durability of armor very quickly);
- A netherite sword withSharpnessV;
- PotionsofStrength,Speed,Night Vision(to somewhat counteract the Darkness effect) andTurtle Master;
- Abeacon, if you have it and can prepare the fighting area, set toResistanceII;
- Golden applesand preferablyenchanted golden apples—the latter are quite rare, but luckily,ancient citiesare the best place to find them;
- Totems of undying—as many as you can fit in your inventory;
- End crystalsif you are skilled in crystal PvP.

What will probably not help:

- Distracting the warden with snowballs, eggs etc.;
- A shield, warden disables it very quickly;
- Thorns enchantment on your armor, this deals very small damage compared to your weapon, and causes armor to break faster.

Fighting the warden in hand-to-hand combat is actually slightly easier (though still incredibly difficult) than fighting it in medium range (5-20 blocks) because the sonic boom attack ignores armor and Protection enchantments. You will die very quickly to these blasts, while you might survive the warden’s melee hits for a bit longer. Consider setting your spawnpoint close by in case the warden kills you, which is likely.

It takes 22 critical hits with a maxed sword and Strength II to kill the warden, and 19 critical hits with a maxed axe, although the latter takes quite a bit longer due to slower attack speed of the axe.

Wardens despawn if unprovoked for 60 seconds. 

### Nether mobs
There are 9 mobs that can spawn exclusively and naturally in the Nether. This list is sorted by chance of an encounter, with the exception of zoglins, as they not spawn naturally but have similarities with the Nether mobs. As zombified piglins and piglins are neutral, combat strategies for them are listed under their own category.

Currently, most of the Nether mobs are hostile, with the exception of the piglin and zombified piglin, which are neutral, and the strider. All can be very dangerous without sufficient weapons, but all can be outrun fairly easily while sprinting, and most despawn on Peaceful, while other become passive. Most nether mobs are immune to fire damage, making lava buckets, Fire Aspect and Flame enchantments useless. Only piglins and hoglins aren't immune to fire damage.

#### Ghasts

See also: Ghast

Players in any exposed area have to deal with ghasts and their fireballs sooner or later, and possibly from the moment they step out of a portal. These mobs fly and move in a very unpredictable way, but have low health, only 10. Ghasts deal a lot of damage when a direct hit from a fireball is taken: on Hard difficulty, this alone can kill an unarmored player in one hit. On lower difficulties, players survive the direct hit, but knockback and fire damage can cause additional troubles. Because of this, players should try to kill any ghast in sight as soon as possible.

Having a ranged weapon is recommended: two shots with an unenchanted bow are enough to kill the ghast, and a bow even with just Power II is guaranteed to kill it in one shot, if fully charged. Another great weapon is the crossbow with the Multishot enchantment, as it fires 3 arrows at once in different directions, giving a high chance that one of them hits the ghast. Arrows fired from crossbows are faster and have further range than from bows.

You can deflect fireballs by hitting them with anything before they impact, even bare hands. Because of their low speed, spamming mouse clicks is often enough to deflect any given attack. It is possible to kill ghasts by reflecting their attacks back at them, but it can be difficult since they are agile. If you do manage to kill a ghast by reflecting their fireball, you get the "Return to Sender" advancement‌[Java Edition  only]/achievement‌[Bedrock Edition  only]. You can easily make a fireball reflect in the direction you want by shooting any projectile at the fireball: snowballs are the best, as they are easy to get and don't have a cooldown, so you can just bombard snowballs and they will hit the fireball at some point. If reflected back to the ghast that shot it, the fireball deals 1000 × 500 damage, instantly killing it.

A ghast can be also killed with melee weapons if you can get close enough before it flies away, but this rarely happens. Alternatively, you can get closer to the mob using an elytra and then attack it with a sword.

Ghast fireballs can damage nether terrain and anything you build in there. Thus, using only materials resistant to their explosions, like cobblestone or nether bricks, is recommended. You should cover up your portal with a bunker-like building, so that ghasts don't blow it up.

Ghasts spawn anywhere in three nether biomes (nether wastes, basalt deltas, and soul sand valley), if only they have enough room: light level is irrelevant. Building large closed structures in those biomes can result in an indoor ghast spawn, which can then cause a lot of damage to your structure if you don't kill the ghast quick.
