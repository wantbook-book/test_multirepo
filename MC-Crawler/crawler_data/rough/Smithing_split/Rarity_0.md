# Rarity
Rarity is a statistic applied to items and blocks to signify their value and ease in obtaining. It has no effect on gameplay whatsoever.

The only way to change an item's rarity is to enchant it, which brings its rarity from Common or Uncommon to Rare, or from Rare to Epic.

## Displaying

  

This section is missing information about Bedrock Edition. 
Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page.


Rarity is intended to display anywhere the item name does.

In Java Edition it is shown in the following situations:

- Item tooltips in the inventory
- Item tooltips above the hotbar
- Successful executions of/give

In Java Edition rarity colors do not display in the following cases:

- Item tooltips from anitem frame[1]
- Contents tooltips from ashulker box[2]
- Item tooltips in thestatisticsscreen[3]
- The CanPlaceOn/CanBreak tags of an item[4]
- Item names in theSuperflatcustomization screen[5]

While the ominous banner in Java Edition displays its name in gold () for the first two cases above, that is not related to rarity. Items with NBT data cannot be specified for the last three cases.

## Notes
1. ↑In Java Edition, all enchanted books appear as Uncommon, even if they do not store any enchantments, while all other items with the StoredEnchantments tag appear as Common. In Bedrock Edition, enchanted books without any enchantments appear as Common.
2. ↑This also applies to any item with an active enchantment, though not a stored enchantment. Items which are already Rare or Epic instead become Epic when enchanted.
