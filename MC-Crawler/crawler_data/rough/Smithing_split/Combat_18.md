### Fishing Rod
- Style: Assistive
- Range: ?
- Damage: Fall damage

Fishing rods are not a weapon in the traditional sense, but useful nonetheless. Their ability to grab and draw in mobs is useful to keep passive mobs from running away when hit, or to draw hostile mobs into traps or hazards. Players even use them on other players, to bring the enemy closer to you, or freeze them and have a chance to get a combo. Additionally, reeling in a mob while standing high above it can launch it quite far into the air, causing it to take fall damage on the way back down. To maximize effectiveness for combat, keep a sword in the item slot next to the fishing rod, so that drawing in an enemy, then striking them with a sword becomes faster. The player can also fly with elytra using fireworks to boost fly higher while use fishing rod grab mobs or player then reeling it can cause high fall damage. Ineffective against players with Feather Falling enchantment. 

### Anvil
- Style: Ambush
- Range: Unlimited
- Damage: ?

Anvils deal as much damage when falling on an entity as that entity would take with no armor or potion effects falling from the same height. This means to kill a player or mob with 20 health, it has to fall 24 blocks. This will damage the anvil as well.

## Fighting styles
Here are some fighting styles that players use to fight mobs and other players. Note that some of these styles are only helpful when fighting other players. Also, not all items that should be brought in combat are listed under "Required items", so make sure to bring all the required items, but also bring standard and basic defensive items, such as tools and armor.

### Melee combat
Required items: 

- Diamond or netheriteswordwith Sharpness enchantment;
- Iron, diamond or netheriteaxewith Sharpness enchantment (only in 1.9+);
- Shield(preferably with Unbreaking enchantment and in 1.11+);
- Armor(preferably diamond or netherite) with Protection enchantment, you do not need a high-tier armor if you are an experienced Minecraft fighter;
- A fewsplash potionsof Swiftness II;
- A few splash potions of Strength II;
- Great saturation and hunger-filling foods, such assteak,cooked porkchopsor at best,golden carrots;
- Golden applesorenchanted golden apples.

#### Pre-combat
Be sure not to consume any of the following items before battle.

- Melons
- Rotten flesh
- Any uncooked meat
- Cookies
- Apples
- Carrots
- Suspicious stew
- Poisonous potatos
- Anypotionswith negative side effects

The reason for this is that these items have a very low effective quality and will make the hunger go down very quickly, especially while in combat. In combat, the player will be sprinting, jumping, attacking, and taking damage. These all affect the player's hunger saturation, or the amount of time each hunger point will last, so they are going to want as much saturation as possible. The following foods are the best choice for pre-combat preparation and are recommended to have while in combat.

- Golden apple
- Steak
- Cooked porkchops
- Golden carrots
- Cake(unless the player can't place blocks due to plugins)

All of these foods, except for cake, have an effective quality score above 20. Cake, with a score of 14.4, is useful because the player can place and eat it without being forced into the speed of crouching. If the player are on a server with plugins that keep players from placing blocks in certain areas, then cake might not be the best choice. Always be sure to keep the sword as set as their most easily accessible item in their hotbar, depending on how their controls are set up. If the player are using the default controls, it is recommended that the player set their sword as the leftmost item on their hotbar. Also, be sure to keep other important items such as food or potions to the left of their hotbar.

### Elytra Sniping
This strategy allows players to take down heavily armored foes using ranged attacks. This style is recommended for players with good aim. It is very effective, but it requires an elytra, which is very rare.

Required items:

- Elytra. Mending and Unbreaking on it is recommended but not necessary
- Manyfirework rocketsto boost elytra
- Abow
- Plenty ofarrows, unless the player have an Infinity enchantment on the bow, in which case the player only have to bring one arrow
- Plenty of food that satisfies both hunger and saturation

Other items that help greatly for strategy:

- Armorwith Protection or Projectile Protection. Consider boots enchanted with Feather Falling to minimize elytra landing damage.
- Enchantments on all tools, weapons, and armor
- Apickaxeto dig out covers in mountains
- A water or lava bucket for eventually creative uses. Don't (unintentionally) burn down a forest.
- A sword. If all goes well, a sword won't be necessary, but it is recommended to bring one just in case.
- Arrows of Harming, as theHarmingeffect ignores armor and will usually deal more damage than conventional arrows against heavily armored targets.

Steps:

1. Equip the elytra and armor for the remaining armor slots.
2. Jump and use fireworks to speed up the elytra. Fly to a place where the player can safely fire at the target.
3. Fire repeatedly, until target is defeated or until the target gets too close.
4. If the target gets too close, repeat step 2 and 3.

This strategy is best used in environments that have high vantage points available such as mountains, jungles with high trees, amplified worlds, etc., with a lot of places where the player can safely use the bow.

Cons:

- The player needs an elytra, which is a late-game item.
- If you die, you will lose the elytra, which is very rare.

Pros:

- Allows you to mostly avoid melee combat and dangerous melee mobs such as the Warden, and grants you force and engagement at longer ranges on your premises.
- If the player needs time to regenerate, drink potions and rearrange the inventory or even place ananvilto repair the elytra, and the player can easily fly to a place far away where you can do just that.
- If you are about to lose the battle, it is relatively easy to escape, and the target will likely have a hard time following you.
- If you have an elytra, it means you probably have shulker boxes too. You can use those for extra storage since you have time to place and use them behind your cover. Or use an ender chest if you want to keep the items in there in case you die.

Alternatively, you can also go airforce-style and shoot from your elytra while flying. However, you will not be able to hide behind cover this way, and it will be harder to hit the target while you are moving.
