#### Wither
Main article: Wither (status effect)
Withers and wither skeletons inflict the Wither effect with their attacks (the wither skulls do not inflict the effect on easy difficulty). This darkens the health bar to  × 10 on Survival and  × 10 on Hardcore, while inflicting damage over time. The effect deals 1 every 2 seconds (40 ticks) for the wither skeleton's attack (level I), and every second for the Wither's skulls (level II). Wither roses also inflict the Wither effect to any mobs colliding it. Players also get the Wither effect after eating suspicious stew made out of wither rose or when hit by potion or arrow of decay.‌[Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education  only] Unlike Poison, withering can kill on any difficulty level, and the darkened health bar makes it harder to keep track of the damage, which the only way is seeing the white spark on the left of the heart.

### Void
Main article: Void
If one were to break through the bedrock barrier found at the bottom of worlds, the void can be seen. Players in the void below the Y-axis of -64‌[Bedrock Edition  only] or -128‌[Java Edition  only] take damage at a rate of about 4 per half-second. The player usually dies from falling in the void, even in Creative or Spectator modes,‌[Java Edition  only] but the player may be saved by throwing an ender pearl before falling below the Y-axis of -64‌[Bedrock Edition  only] or -128‌[Java Edition  only].

Falling into the void in the End is more likely, and is the only way to access the void in Survival mode without exploiting glitches.

By using /effect to give the player Regeneration 5+ or Instant Health, they can fall infinitely into the void without dying until the effect wears off or the game crashes.‌[Java Edition  only]

In Bedrock Edition, the player can survive in the void in Creative mode, but there is a one-way barrier at Y=-104 to prevent falling further into the void. However, this barrier can be teleported past by teleporting the player to any location with a Y value of -106 and below. The player continues falling until the player teleports away, flies back up, or crashes the game.

### Explosions
Main article: Explosion
Explosions cause varying amounts of damage based on the explosion strength, the entity's proximity to the explosion, and whether it is obstructed by solid blocks.

### Firework rocket explosion

Firework rocket explosions can deal damage to entities if crafted with a firework star.

The maximum damage about is 6 at the explosion's center with one firework star, decreasing to 1 at the edge of a radius of 5 blocks (exclusive). Each additional firework star adds 2 to the maximum.

If a rocket crafted with a firework star is used to provide a speed boost while gliding with elytra, it explodes as it is used, dealing 7 damage to the player.

### Freezing
Freezing hearts when the player is submerged in powder snow.
When an entity is inside a powder snow block, they begin to freeze, taking damage. 

A player submerged in powder snow sees a frosty frame slowly fade in at the sides of the screen and the FOV slowly decreases. After 7 seconds (140 game ticks), the player's hearts change to a cyan frosty texture (), and the player begins taking damage at a rate of 1 HP every two seconds (40 game ticks). If the player leaves the powder snow block, the vignette slowly fades away. A frozen player moves slower than usual until the vignette fully fades away. This is controlled by the TicksFrozen data tag, which increases by 1 every game tick (to a maximum of 300) for an entity within the powder snow block. It decreases at a rate of 2 per game tick after the entity leaves the powder snow block. This is currently not a separate effect when used with commands such as /effect give freezing, and does not have its own unique art, particles, or potion. 

Players do not take damage from powder snow if the game rule freezeDamage is set to false.

Mobs and players that are freezing have a shivering animation.

Wearing any piece of leather armor stops the freezing effect and damage. This applies to entities that can wear armor, such as zombies. Horses wearing leather horse armor also don’t take damage from freezing. 

Snow golems, strays, polar bears, and withers are immune to freezing damage. Fire-related mobs like striders, magma cubes, and blazes take extra damage from freezing. A skeleton can freeze but does not take damage; instead, it begins the process of converting to a stray when continuously in powder snow for 7 seconds.
