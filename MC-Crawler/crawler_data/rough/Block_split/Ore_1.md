1. ↑This refers to coal ore blocks spawned in blobs and not as parts of fossils or mansion forges.
2. ↑Instead of multi-block blobs, emerald ore is placed in scattered blocks.
3. ↑Deepslate variants only generate in the deepslate under layer 0.
4. ↑Copper ore blobs generate in larger sizes in this biome.
5. ↑Gold ore has increased frequency in this biome.
6. ↑ a bThis is based on data acquired from real world generation. Maximum values in world generation data files are different because in actual generation, terrain and features might prevent ores from spawning.
7. ↑Unlike most other ores, ancient debris' frequency peaks at layer 16, and quickly tapers off above and below.
