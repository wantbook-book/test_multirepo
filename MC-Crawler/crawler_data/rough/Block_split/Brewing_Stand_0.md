## Obtaining
### Breaking
A brewing stand can be obtained using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing in Java Edition, while it drops itself in Bedrock Edition. However, destroying a brewing stand that is completely full with blaze powder drops the powder with it.

### Natural generation
Brewing stands generate in end ships. They have two Instant Health II potions in their holders. 

A brewing stand also generates in the basement of igloos with a splash potion of Weakness in it.

Brewing stands can generate without potions in village churches.

## Usage
Brewing stand GUI in Java Edition
By default, the interface of a brewing stand is labeled "Brewing Stand", but this name can be customized by naming it in an anvil before placing it.

Brewing stands cannot be pushed by pistons in Java Edition.

### Brewing
Main article: Brewing
The main purpose of brewing stands is to allow for the brewing of potions. Its interface can be opened by pressing use on them.

Brewing stands need blaze powder as fuel. Each piece brews 20 batches of potions, with each stage of brewing counting separately. Unlike furnaces, there is no time limit; fuel is consumed only when there are water bottles and an ingredient to brew into it.

Brewing stands interact with hoppers as follows:

- They accept brewing ingredients from hoppers pointing down into the top.
- Any valid brewing ingredient is pushed into the ingredient slot, regardless of whether it would actually start the brewing process.
- Any valid potion recipe can be preloaded for "hands-free" brewing of a complex recipe, with thenether wartfalling through into the stand for the first step.
- Bottles (including empty bottles) and fuel are accepted from hoppers pointing into the side.
- Finished products can be pulled out by hoppers below, but each stage of brewing counts as a batch of "finished" potions.

In Minecraft Education, elements can be combined in the brewing stand to make the medicine potions: antidote, elixir, eye drops, and tonic.
