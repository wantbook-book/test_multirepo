## Obtaining
### Breaking
Crimson roots can be mined instantly with any tool. They drop themselves when broken. Flower pots containing crimson roots drop both the flower pot and crimson roots when broken.

| Block    | Crimson Roots       |

| Hardness | 0                   |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.05                |

### Natural generation
Crimson roots generate often in the crimson forest biome and rarely in the warped forest biome and in the soul sand valley biome.


### Mob loot
An enderman holding crimson roots drops the block upon death.

### Chest loot

### Post-generation
Applying bone meal to crimson nylium causes crimson roots to appear on nearby crimson or warped nylium. There is also a low chance for bone meal applied to warped nylium to generate crimson roots.

## Usage
### Decoration
All of the blocks that crimson roots can be placed on.
Crimson roots are decorative blocks. They can be planted on the same blocks that crimson fungi can be placed on. Warped roots can be planted in a flower pot, which gives them a different texture.

### Composting
Crimson roots can also be used on a composter, with a 65% chance of increasing the level by 1.
