### Natural generation
Poison farmland occurs naturally in the Potato dimension: it covers a large portion of the fields biome (where only potatos are growing on it), as well as generating in potato villages (where potatoes, wheat seeds and carrots can be found growing on it).

### Post-generation
A player can create a block of poison farmland by using a hoe on terre de pomme, peelgrass block, corrupted peelgrass block or poison path.

## Usage
On poison farmland can grow plants.
