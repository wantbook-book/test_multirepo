## Obtaining
Fire cannot be obtained as an item under any circumstances in Java Edition, though in Bedrock Edition fire may be obtained as an item via inventory editing.

### Natural generation
Fire naturally generates in fire patches across the terrain of the Nether. 

Fire also generates on top of netherrack in some treasure room bastion remnants.

In the End, fire generates on bedrock blocks on top of end spikes, at the same location as the end crystals.


### Post-generation
Lava generated next to flammable blocks can naturally cause fires.

Fire spreads quickly across flammable blocks, and can spontaneously ignite when flammable blocks are near lava, even though many blocks that should be flammable cannot catch fire from nearby lava.

Lightning strikes can also set fires, regardless of whether they are created naturally, redirected to lightning rods, summoned by a trident enchanted with Channeling, or created using the /summon command.

Placing an end crystal on bedrock or obsidian in the End causes fire to appear at the end crystal's location.

The explosion from sleeping in a bed in the Nether or the End creates fire, as does the explosion of a ghast fireball or the impact of a blaze fireball. Using a charged respawn anchor in the Overworld or the End also creates fire from the explosion.

## Usage
### Placement
Before a fire.
During the fire.
After a fire.
Fire can be placed using flint and steel or a fire charge. Fire created on soul sand or soul soil becomes soul fire.

When placed, a fire burns for a short and randomly determined amount of time. If nothing flammable is adjacent to it, the flames die out. Water that touches fire extinguishes it.

It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.[1]

### Burning entities
Players and many mobs burn when exposed to fire. Burning obstructs the player's view slightly. While inside a fire block, the fire inflicts damage at a rate of 1 per half-second unless the player or mob has Fire Resistance or a total Fire Protection of 7 or higher.‌[BE  only] When the player is on fire outside the fire block, they take damage at 1 per second. This is the same rate that the player gains health in Peaceful difficulty, so burning alone cannot kill the player in this mode. Soul fire deals damage at a rate of 2 per half-second, making it more dangerous than normal fire. After leaving a fire source, the player or mob continues burning for some time depending on how long it was exposed to the fire (stored in a Fire tag shared by all entities). Players and mobs that are burning can be extinguished by powder snow, rain, water or a cauldron.

Most dropped items that are in fire briefly catch fire and disappear. This includes the item forms of blocks that would not be flammable if placed, including obsidian. The only exceptions are these netherite-related items: netherite tools and weapons, netherite armor, blocks of netherite, netherite scrap, netherite ingots, and ancient debris.

If a mob able to drop meat dies while on fire, it drops the cooked version of it, with the exception of fish that is dropped by polar bears‌[JE  only] or guardians. This also applies to the zombie's uncommon potato drop; if a zombie dies while on fire and should drop a potato, it becomes a baked potato.‌[JE  only]

Most Nether mobs are invulnerable to fire and cannot burn. Exceptions include skeletons, endermen, piglins, piglin brutes, and hoglins. 

Zoglins, vexes, agents, NPCs, wardens, and withers are also invulnerable to fire.

Burning is not considered a status effect and therefore cannot be cured by milk.

### Spread
Safe building area around a fire
Fire spreads over flammable surfaces and can climb up walls, across floors and ceilings, and over small gaps. More precisely, a fire block can turn any air block that is adjacent to a flammable block into a fire block. This can happen at a distance of up to one block downward, one block sideways (including diagonals), and four blocks upward of the original fire block (not the block the fire is on/next to). Therefore, if the player is using fire to build a fireplace, caution is needed. Blocks in the way do not prevent fire from igniting blocks above it—so even if the player protects a wooden roof with cobblestone between it and the fire, the fire ignores that cobblestone.

Fire spreads from a still lava block similarly: any air block one above and up to one block sideways (including diagonals) or two above and two blocks sideways (including diagonals) that is adjacent to a flammable block may be turned into a fire block.

Fire that naturally spreads into a valid nether portal frame activates the portal.
