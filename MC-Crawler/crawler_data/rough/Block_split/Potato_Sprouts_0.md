## Obtaining
### Breaking
Potato sprouts can be broken instantly using anything, including the player's fist, and always drop themselves as an item.

### Natural generation
Potato sprouts generate commonly on the surface of corruption biome in the Potato dimension.

### Post-generation
When potato leaves decay, or are broken by any tool except shears, they have a 5% chance of dropping potato sprouts. The Fortune enchantment increases the rate to 6.25% at level I, 8.33% at level II, and 10% at level III.

## Usage
If placed on peelgrass blocks or corrupted peelgrass blocks, potato sprouts can grow into potato trees. Potato sprouts function similarly to fungi: they don't grow into trees on their own, bone meal must be applied.
