A dropper is a low-capacity storage block that can eject its contents into the world or into other containers when given a redstone signal.

## Obtaining
### Breaking
A dropper can be mined with a pickaxe, in which case it drops itself and its contents. If mined without a pickaxe, the dropper drops only its contents.

## Usage
A dropper can be used as a container or as a redstone component to move items.

A dropper can be placed so that its output faces in any direction, including up or down. When placed, the dropper's output faces toward the player. With default textures, the droppers output side looks like a face when positioned for horizontal output. Otherwise, the output side has a square hole.

In Java Edition, droppers cannot be moved by pistons.

### Container
GUI of the dropper.
A dropper has 9 slots of inventory space.

To open the dropper GUI, use the Use Item control. To move items between the dropper inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the dropper GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items. To exit the dropper GUI, use the Esc control.

By default, the GUI of a dropper is labeled "Dropper". A dropper's GUI label can be changed by naming the dropper in an anvil before placing it. In Java Edition, droppers can also be renamed by using the /data command (for example, to label a dropper at (0,64,0) "Alice's Dropper", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'"Alice's Dropper"'}).

In Java Edition, a dropper can be "locked" (or subsequently unlocked) by setting the dropper's Lock tag with the /data command. If a dropper's Lock tag is not blank, the dropper cannot be accessed except by players holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. For example, to lock a dropper at (0,64,0) so that only players holding an item named "Alice's Key" can access the dropper, use /data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:"Alice's Key"}.

### Redstone component
See also: Redstone circuit

A dropper can be used to eject items, or push items into another container.

** Activation **
A dropper can be activated by:
- an adjacent activepower component(exceptions:a redstone torch does not turn ON a dropper it is attached to)
- an adjacent powered opaqueblock(strongly-powered or weakly-powered)
- a poweredredstone repeaterorredstone comparatorfacing the dropper
- poweredredstone dustconfigured to point at the dropper, or on top of it; a dropper isnotactivated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is configured to point in another direction.

In addition to the methods above, droppers inJava Editioncan also be activated byquasi-connectivity. A dropper activates if one of the methods abovewouldactivate a mechanism component in the block above the dropper, even if there is no mechanism component there (even if the block above the dropper isairor a transparent block), but only when the dropper receives a block update (including a redstone update within two blocks of the dropper).
A dropper has a 2redstone tick(4 game ticks, or 0.2 seconds barring lag) delay between activation and a response. During this time, additional inputs are ignored.
** Behavior **
See also: Tutorials/Item elevator § Dropper

When activated, a dropper waits 2 redstone ticks (4 game ticks, or 0.2 seconds barring lag) and then ejects one item from its inventory. The dropper does not continue to eject items while activated — ejection occurs only on the initial activation (therising edgeof an input signal). To eject multiple items, repeatedly activate the dropper with aclock circuit.
If multiple slots are occupied by items, a random occupied slot is chosen for ejection. The slot is chosen when an item is ejected, not when the dropper is initially activated, thus it is possible to move items into or out of a dropper between its activation and item dispensing.
If the dropper is facing a container, the ejected item is transferred into the container. If the container it is facing is full, or the item cannot be inserted into the container, the dropper does not activate.
Otherwise, the item is ejected in the direction the dropper is facing, as if a player had used thedropcontrol. Even items that would be treated differently by adispenser(such asarrows) are simply ejected by a dropper.
A dropper makes a clicking noise (therandom.clicksound event) when activated empty or when ejecting items into air. It is silent when it successfully transfers an item into any kind of chest or barrel, or another dropper.
A dropper is an opaque block, so powering it directly can cause adjacent mechanism components (including other droppers) to activate as well.

A line of droppers, each pushing items into the next dropper, is known as a dropper pipe. A dropper pipe must be clocked to move items, but can be clocked to move items faster than a hopper pipe's transfer rate. When a dropper pipe pushes items upward, it is known as a droppervator (short for "dropper elevator").
