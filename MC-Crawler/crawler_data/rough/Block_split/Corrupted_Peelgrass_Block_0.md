### Natural generation
Corrupted peelgrass blocks naturally generate throughout the surface of the Potato dimension as the ground of corruption and wasteland biomes.

### Post-generation
Corrupted peelgrass can spread to nearby terre de pomme blocks and normal peelgrass blocks, just like grass spreads to dirt. Additionally, using corrupted potato peels on terre de pomme turns it to corrupted peelgrass.

## Usage
### Farming
Using a hoe on a corrupted peelgrass block turns it into poison farmland. Potatoes can grow on corrupted peelgrass blocks without the need of tilling them.

### Paths
Using a shovel on a corrupted peelgrass block turns it into a poison path.

### Peeling
Using a potato peeler on a corrupted peelgrass block turns it into terre de pomme, and drops corrupted potato peels.
