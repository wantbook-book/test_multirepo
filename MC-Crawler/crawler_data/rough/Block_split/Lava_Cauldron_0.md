# Cauldron
A cauldron is a block that can contain water, lava or powder snow and, in certain situations, collect it from the environment. In Bedrock Edition, it can also hold potions or dyed water. It also serves as a leatherworker's job site block.

## Obtaining
### Breaking
A cauldron can be obtained using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. Regardless of the tool, when a cauldron is destroyed, its contents are lost.

1. ↑Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

### Natural generation
A naturally occurring cauldron inside of a witch hut. Notice the incorrect cat skin.
A single empty cauldron is generated in each swamp hut. In Bedrock Edition, the cauldrons generated there are 1⁄3 to 2⁄3 full of a random potion.

A cauldron 2⁄3 full of water is generated in each igloo basement.

Cauldron in woodland mansion jail.
Cauldrons can be found in a few rooms inside of woodland mansions.

Two filled cauldrons can be found inside savanna, taiga, snowy taiga, and snowy tundra village tannery houses.

A single filled cauldron can be found in plains village and desert village tannery houses.

In Java Edition, three filled cauldrons can be found in plains village tannery houses.

Cauldrons can also spawn in trail ruins.

### Crafting
A cauldron can be crafted from iron ingots.

## Usage
### Storage for substances
Cauldrons can hold a variety of substances. Fluids they cannot hold include milk, honey and any food items that exist in bowls; namely mushroom stew, beetroot soup, rabbit stew and suspicious stew. In Java Edition, cauldrons containing fluids are considered by the game to be separate blocks from each other and from empty cauldrons, which does not affect gameplay but does affect the commands needed to place them.

#### Holding water
A cauldron can be filled with water by using a water bucket on the cauldron. Once completely filled, a cauldron can be used to fill a water bucket by using an empty bucket on the cauldron; this empties the cauldron. Despite containing water, using a fish bucket on a cauldron does not fill it with water, but places water against it, meaning it does nothing to the cauldron.[1]

A cauldron can also be filled by dumping a water bucket on the block above the cauldron. Once the water block is removed, the cauldron is filled to the full level with water.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

In Java Edition, a cauldron can contain three levels of water. One level of water can be added to a cauldron by using a water bottle on it. One level of water can be removed from a cauldron, filling a water bottle, by using a glass bottle on it.

In Bedrock Edition, a cauldron can contain six levels of water, and using a water bottle or a bottle on a cauldron respectively adds or removes two levels from it. If there are less than two levels remaining, a bottle cannot be used to retrieve the remaining water, and it must be either replaced or removed through a method that reduces the level by one. 

A cauldron slowly fills with water when rained upon, if starting empty or with some water. This happens randomly, at 5% of the rate in which snow accumulates on the ground during snowfall.

Water can be stored in a cauldron, even in the Nether. Water in a cauldron does not freeze in cold biomes.

Water in a cauldron does not absorb explosion damage; make sounds and particles; absorb fall damage;[2][3] allow tridents enchanted with Riptide to activate;[4][5] or damage endermen‌‌[JE  only], striders, or blazes.[6][7] Cauldrons do not deal drowning damage to mobs inside of them[8] and fish act as if there is no water inside it.[9] The player cannot float or swim in it, as the water is about level with the player's waist. Jumping in a cauldron does not produce any bubble or water particles.

A cauldron placed below a down-facing pointed dripstone that has water placed a block above it slowly fills with water. The same works with lava, allowing for infinite lava generation.

Attempting to add lava or potion to water empties the cauldron.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

The water in a cauldron cannot be sucked up by a sponge, whether the sponge is touching the cauldron or not.
