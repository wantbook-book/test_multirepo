|           | Pick Block           | Pressing that button while looking at a block or an entity causes the game to attempt placing a corresponding item for the block or entity in the player's hand. For blocks, it is simply the block in item form. For mobs, the game places the corresponding spawn egg in the player's hand. This also works onboats, all types ofminecarts,paintings, andarmor stands‌[Java Edition  only][3]to get the entity in item form. If the item is in the hotbar, it switches the selected hotbar slot to the slot with that item. If the item is not in the hotbar, but in the player's inventory, it moves that item from the inventory into the hotbar. If no hotbar slot is empty, the item selected is replaced. In creative mode without the item in the inventory, the game gives the player that item. This works only in creative mode for entities.‌[Java Edition  only][4]If used on a tile entity while holding Ctrl, the tile entity's nbt data is copied. The block given to the player has the Lore: "(+DATA)." |
