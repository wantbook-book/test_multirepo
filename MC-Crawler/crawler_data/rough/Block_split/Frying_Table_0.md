### Breaking
A frying table can be broken using any tool with equal efficiency, and always drops itself.

1. â†‘Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

### Natural generation
Frying tables generate naturally as part of potato villages.

## Usage
Unlike campfires, frying tables do not produce light.

Frying tables are lit by default when placed. They can be manually lit using flint and steel (either by player or dispenser), fire charges, shooting it with a flaming arrow, or fireball projectiles when /gamerule mobGriefing is true.

A frying table can be extinguished by waterlogging it, throwing a splash water bottle at it, or using a shovel on it. Frying tables can not be lit from their bottom face. As with torches, rain does not extinguish frying tables.

Using flint and steel on the side of a lit or waterlogged frying table sets the adjacent air block on fire instead.

### Particles and smoke signals
Frying tables produce smoke particles that float up around 10 blocks before disappearing. If a hay bale is placed below, the frying table becomes a signal fire and the smoke floats up 24 blocks instead.

Frying table smoke particles can partially pass through a block directly above it, but do not pass through blocks more than one block directly above it.

Although a trap door is thinner than a slab, a trap door can block the smoke completely, preventing the smoke from floating up.

Frying tables emit extra smoke particles during rain, similar to lava.

Frying tables also emit occasional ember particles, similar to lava.

### Damage
Frying tables cannot damage players, but do damage mobs standing on top of them even if underwater (with exceptions such as shulkers, zombified piglins or guardians), but only if lit. Frying tables deal 1 (although damage immunity reduces this to once every half-second) Frying tables do not cause lasting burning or destroy items. Damage taken is considered fire damage and is reduced by armor (which loses durability), the Resistance effect, and the Protection and Fire Protection enchantments. The player can avoid being damaged at all, either by using a potion of Fire Resistance or wearing Frost Walker boots.

Regardless of height, all blocks prevent damage done to mobs or players above frying tables. The frying table deals damage only to entities occupying its block.
