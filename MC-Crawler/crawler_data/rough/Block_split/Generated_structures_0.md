# Structure
This page lists structures (also known as generated structures or structure features) in Minecraft. A structure is defined as what is disabled when the "Generate structures" world creation option is turned off. Features, such as monster room and desert wells, do still generate with this option turned off; however, they are listed on this page in § Structure-like features due to them having the appearance of an artificial structure as opposed to a natural formation.
