# Emerald Ore
Emerald ore is a rare mineral block that generates only in mountains and windswept hills biomes. It drops emeralds when mined, or itself if mined with a pickaxe with the Silk Touch enchantment.

Deepslate emerald ore is a variant of emerald ore that can generate in deepslate and tuff blobs.

## Obtaining
### Breaking
See also: Fortune § Ore

Emerald ore can be mined with an iron pickaxe or better, otherwise it drops nothing. If mined without Silk Touch, the block drops 1 emerald (or up to 4 with Fortune). It also drops 3–7 when broken.

### Natural generation
See also: Ore (feature)

Emerald ore generates in mountains and windswept hills biomes in the form of ore features, from levels -16 to 320, being most common at level 232, and becoming less common toward either end of the range. Emerald ore attempts to generate 100 times per chunk in blobs of 0—4 ores. Emerald ore can be exposed to the sky.[1]

Emerald ore can replace stone, andesite, diorite, granite, tuff, and deepslate. Emerald ore that replaces tuff or deepslate becomes deepslate emerald ore, which is the rarest ore in Minecraft, rarer than normal emerald ore and ancient debris, even rarer than its second-place competitor, (normal) diamond ore. It generates only between the altitudes of -16 and 8 where deepslate naturally occurs, which happens to be toward the end of emerald ore distribution where it is extremely rare; its limitation to certain biomes further adds to its rarity.
