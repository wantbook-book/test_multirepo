### Mobs
** General **
- When trying to damage a mob, the player will pick it up instead.
	- When falling, the player holds onto the mob that they picked up.
	- Some mobs like the ender dragon behave like rideable entities.
	- Some mobs like the wither cannot be ridden or picked up.
- To damage mobs, the player has to:
	- Throw the mob
	- Throw any block, item or entity at the mob
		- Different blocks deal different amounts of damage based on their blast resistance and speed; the formula is speed*10*blast resistance.
		- Different mobs also deal different amounts of damage based on their height and speed; the formula is speed*5*height.
			- However, the player also throws mobs slower the taller it is.
	- Release them in a stacked group of two or more.
	- Some mobs like the ender dragon cannot take damage from any block, item or entity.
- Mobs that can hold items, like zombies, skeletons, etc. can steal the player's held item when damaging them, playingnothingtoseeheremovealong:ooof.
- Mobs can also be made to wear carved pumpkins or barrels when the blocks are thrown at them.
