		- filtered_messages: Only inRealms. The lines of text shown to players with the profanity filter turned on instead of the regular lines. This tag is automatically set to""for lines containing blocked words and to the line's normal contents for the other lines when a player with the profanity filter turnedoffedits the sign, so players with the filteroncannot see the blocked words. If a player with the filterontries to use blocked words in one or more lines, the line(s) inmessagescontaining blocked words are set to"", which makes them render completely blank, and this tag is also given the same contents. If multiple lines have been edited before the sign editing GUI is closed, only the lines containing blocked words are blanked.
		- messages: A list of text for each line.
			- : Text for each line. Must beRaw JSON text format.
	- back_text: A compound that discribes back text.ã€€The same structure asfront_text.

The character limit for the Text tags depends on the width of the characters. Although the Text tags are string objects, they should contain JSON text, which are evaluated as compound objects.
