# Decorated Pot
A decorated pot is a storage block crafted from bricks and/or pottery sherds, with the items used individually affecting the appearance of its four side faces. It can store a single inventory slot's worth of items, which cannot be seen or retrieved by hand without breaking the pot.

## Obtaining
### Breaking
Decorated pots can be broken with any tool and are mined instantly. A decorated pot drops the four pottery sherds or bricks used to craft it when mined with a pickaxe, axe, shovel, hoe or sword not enchanted with Silk Touch. It drops itself when mined with anything else, including tools listed above enchanted with Silk Touch.

A decorated pot breaks when hit by one of the following projectiles, causing it to shatter into sherds or bricks:

- Arrow
- Tipped Arrow
- Spectral Arrow
- Trident
- Firework Rocket
- Snowball
- Egg
- Fireball
- Small Fireball
- Dragon Fireball
- Wither Skull
- Wind Charge‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0]

A decorated pot drops itself if pushed by a piston. It also always drops itself when destroyed by an explosion, similar to other precious blocks such as beacons and shulker boxes.[1]

Stored items are dropped when the decorated pot is broken, regardless of whether the pot shatters into sherds or drops itself. Breaking a pot is the only way to access the stored items without using a hopper.

In Java Edition, if the cracked block state is set to true, a decorated pot always drops sherds or bricks regardless of the breaking method.

### Crafting
| Ingredients             | Crafting recipe | Description                                                        |

The decorated pot's side textures correspond to the item used in the crafting. If a pottery sherd is used, that side bears the texture of that pottery sherd, if a brick is used, that side bears the default texture.

### Natural generation
Decorated pots naturally generate in trial chambers, with loot inside.‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0] Decorated pots in the trial chambers are composed of either four bricks or three bricks either one flow, guster, or scrape pottery sherd.

## Usage
Decorated pots can be used for decoration. Due to the top part of the decorated pot having no collision, other blocks can be placed on top of them, including other decorated pots and regular flower pots, which are required to place a flower in the decorated pot.

Pressing the use control on a decorated pot causes it to play a wobble animation, triggering a vibration frequency of 11.

Decorated pots crafted without sherds can also serve as a temporary building block, similar to scaffolding and slime blocks, because they are easy to craft, stack to 64, and can be broken instantly by hand.
