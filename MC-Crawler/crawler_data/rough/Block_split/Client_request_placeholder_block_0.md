## Obtaining
This block cannot be obtained via /give or /setblock, and as such can only be obtained through inventory editors or add-ons.

## Usage
Though the block is visually transparent, it behaves as an opaque block, and thus allows for solid blocks connected to it to be seen through. Because of this ability, it is sometimes called an "x-ray block".[1] It cannot be selected; attempting to do so targets anything behind it. The block's intended use is unknown; it might be used by the client when unloading a chunk or updating a block.
