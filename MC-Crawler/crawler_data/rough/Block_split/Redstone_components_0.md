# Redstone components
Redstone components are the blocks used to build redstone circuits. Redstone components include power source components (such as redstone torches, buttons, and pressure plates), transmission components (such as redstone dust and redstone repeaters), and mechanism components (such as pistons, doors, and redstone lamps).

This article assumes familiarity with the basics of redstone structures. This article also limits its discussion of each component to its role in redstone structures; for full details about a component, see the main article for the block.

##  Power components
Power components create redstone signals, either permanently or in response to player, mob, and environmental activity.

###  Block of redstone























Block of Redstone's range of activationIt does not power any adjacent opaque block
Main article: Block of Redstone
A block of redstone provides constant power. It can be moved by pistons.

** Activation **
A block of redstone is always ON.
** Effect **
A block of redstone powers adjacent mechanism components (including those above or below) and adjacentredstone dust. It also powers adjacentredstone comparatorsorredstone repeatersfacing away from it.
A block of redstone does not power adjacent opaque blocks.
###  Button














P.
















Button's range of activationIt powers the opaque block it is attached to
Main article: Button
A button is used to generate a pulse. A button may be of two types: wooden or stone.

** Placement **
A button can be attached to any part of mostopaqueblocks. If the attachment block is removed, the button drops into the item form.
** Activation **
A player can activate a button by pressing theUsecontrol while looking at it. A stone button stays ON for 10ticks(1 second), while a wooden button stays ON for 15 ticks (1.5 seconds). A wooden button can also be turned ON by anarrowortridentthat has been shot at it. In such a case, the button remains ON until the arrow or trident despawns (after one minute) or is taken.
** Effect **
While activated, a button and its attachment block both power adjacent redstone dust (including beneath the button, and beneath and on top of the block), and all adjacent redstone comparators or redstone repeaters facing away from it. They also activate all adjacent mechanism components (including those above or below).
###  Calibrated sculk sensor
Main article: Calibrated Sculk Sensor
A calibrated sculk sensor functions similar to a sculk sensor (emitting a redstone signal when it detects a vibration), but with twice the range and half the cooldown of a sculk sensor. It can be calibrated using a redstone signal strength level to make it only detect a specific vibration frequency.
A player can choose the vibration it detects.

###  Chiseled bookshelf
Main article: Chiseled Bookshelf
A chiseled bookshelf emits a signal strength of 1-6 (depending on the last book slot interacted with) when a redstone comparator is behind it. It can store enchanted or unenchanted books. The type of book inside does not affect the redstone signal but the number does.

###  Daylight detector























Daylight Detector's range of activationIt does not power any adjacent opaque block
Main article: Daylight Detector
A daylight detector can be used to detect the time of the Minecraft day.

** Activation **
A daylight detector, if exposed to the sky ("sl" greater than 0), remains activated while the sun is in in the sky. A daylight detector blocked from the sky ("sl" equals 0) remains activated while the moon is in the sky.
** Effect **
While activated, a daylight detector powers adjacent redstone dust (including beneath it), and all adjacent redstone comparators or redstone repeaters facing away from it, at a power level proportionate to the height of the sun or moon in the sky. It also activates all adjacent mechanism components (including those above or below).
A daylight detector does not power adjacent opaque blocks.
###  Detector rail



















P.












Detector Rail's range of activationIt powers the opaque block it is attached to
Main article: Detector Rail
Detector rail as power component
A detector rail is used to detect the passage of a minecart.

** Placement **
A detector rail can be attached to thetopof anyopaqueblock, or to thetopof an upside-downslabor upside-downstairs. If the attachment block is removed, the detector rail drops as an item.
When placed, a detector rail lines up with adjacentrails,powered rails, and other detector rails, as well as adjacent rails one block above it. If there are two adjacent rails not on opposite sides, or three or more adjacent rails, the detector rail lines up in the east-west direction. If there are no adjacent rails, the detector rail lines up in the north-south direction. If there is an adjacent rail one block above, the detector rail slants to match it (when there is more than one adjacent rail to slant toward, the order of preference is: west, east, south, and north). Other configurations can be created by placing and removing various rail.
** Activation **
A detector rail turns ON when aminecartpasses over it, and turns OFF when it leaves.
** Effect **
While activated, a detector rail and its attachment block (unless attached to a slab or stairs) both power adjacent redstone dust (including beneath the block), and all adjacent redstone comparators or redstone repeaters facing away. They also activate all adjacent mechanism components (including those above or below).
