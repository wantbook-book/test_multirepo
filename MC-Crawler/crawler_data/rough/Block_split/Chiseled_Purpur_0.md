## Mechanics
### Enchantments
This is a list of unused features related to enchantments.

#### Enchant anything
In Bedrock Edition, players cannot enchant a block or item; only tools, weapons, and armor can be enchanted, even if the player is in creative mode. However, it is possible to apply enchantments to non-enchantable items or blocks using an NBT editor. By using an NBT editor, it is possible to apply enchantments that cannot be applied in-game normally, such as Fire Aspect on flint and steel or Blast Resistance on TNT. It is also possible to add multiple enchantments that are not compatible with each other such as Smite or Bane of Arthropods to a sword. Although the /enchant command in Bedrock Edition cannot enchant past the maximum level limit, it is possible to enchant items with a higher level than the max limit via the NBT editor.

### Loot table
#### Mobs
In vanilla behavior packs, there is a loot table for the giant, a mob that cannot be spawned in Bedrock Edition.

#### Chest loot
