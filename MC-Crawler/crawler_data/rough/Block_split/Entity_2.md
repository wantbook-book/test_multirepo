## Motion of entities
"Gravity" redirects here.  For the Minecraft Dungeons enchantment, see MCD:Gravity.
Gravity works differently in Minecraft than the real world, as not everything is subject to the same acceleration. Additionally, there is a drag force proportional to velocity, again dependent on the entity.

This is a GitHub repository with some in-depth explanation about the topic.

Applying an initial upward velocity initialVelocity on an entity, the entity's vertical velocity after falling for a number of ticks ticksPassed can be given by the formulas:

Drag applied before acceleration:
- finalVelocity=(initialVelocity×(1−drag)ticksPassed)−(acceleration×1−(1−drag)ticksPasseddrag)

Drag applied after acceleration[note 2]:
- finalVelocity=(initialVelocity×(1−drag)ticksPassed)−(acceleration×1−(1−drag)ticksPasseddrag×(1−drag))

1. ↑ a bIn Bedrock Edition, these entities are under the mob category.
2. ↑ a b c dNote that when living entities and explosive projectiles are simulated, the drag is applied after the acceleration, rather than before; this is why their terminal velocities aren't whole numbers while the others are.
3. ↑Players, mobs and armor stands whose OnGround property is set to 1 have an horizontal drag force of ~0.454.
4. ↑ a b c d eIn each tick, items, falling blocks, primed TNTs, minecarts, boats, experience orbs and fishing bobbers apply acceleration together with velocity to update the position. This means that the new position is calculated by subtracting the acceleration from the current velocity.
5. ↑Minecarts have a maximum horizontal velocity of 0.4. Any greater value is reset to that number.
6. ↑Boats' horizontal position gets updated using next tick's velocity instead of the current one.
7. ↑ a bExplosive projectiles and wind charges are not affected by gravity but instead get acceleration from getting damaged.
8. ↑Dangerous wither skulls have drag force of ~0.27.
