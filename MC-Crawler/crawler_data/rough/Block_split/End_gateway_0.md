# End gateway
End gateways are intradimensional portals generated in the End: some are spawned around the central island after each death of the ender dragon; others are randomly generated throughout the outer islands.

On the central island, up to 20 gateways can be spawned. These can send the player far away to the outer islands, each of which has a corresponding gateway that returns the player back to the central island. There are other randomly-generated gateways that always lead the player back to the obsidian platform. They provide quick access to the different parts of the End dimension.

### By defeating the dragon
#### On the central island
A group of 20 End gateways can be spawned around the edge of the central island, one at a time by defeating the dragon. Their configuration resembles a perfect circle, equally distributed, surrounding the island at Y-level 75, at a distance of 96 blocks (regardless of angle) away from the center (0,0) in random order. 

These gateways are referred in the game as END_GATEWAY_DELAYED. They function by sending the player far away to the outer islands, in the exact direction that that gateway is located relative to the island center (0,0).

They do not regenerate after the ender dragon has been defeated 20 times.

The position of these gateways are always fixed, as is shown below:

| Number | Position         |
|--------|------------------|
| 1      | x:96 y:75 z:0    |
| 2      | x:91 y:75 z:29   |
| 3      | x:77 y:75 z:56   |
| 4      | x:56 y:75 z:77   |
| 5      | x:29 y:75 z:91   |
| 6      | x:-1 y:75 z:96   |
| 7      | x:-30 y:75 z:91  |
| 8      | x:-57 y:75 z:77  |
| 9      | x:-78 y:75 z:56  |
| 10     | x:-92 y:75 z:29  |
| 11     | x:-96 y:75 z:-1  |
| 12     | x:-92 y:75 z:-30 |
| 13     | x:-78 y:75 z:-57 |
| 14     | x:-57 y:75 z:-78 |
| 15     | x:-30 y:75 z:-92 |
| 16     | x:0 y:75 z:-96   |
| 17     | x:29 y:75 z:-92  |
| 18     | x:56 y:75 z:-78  |
| 19     | x:77 y:75 z:-57  |
| 20     | x:91 y:75 z:-30  |

The order in which these gateways are created as dragons are killed depends on the world seed.

#### On the outer islands
Each of the 20 gateways on the central island spawns an additional gateway that is connected to itself, after having been activated once. These gateways are located much further away, reaching out in all directions to the outer islands in the End dimension. They still arrange in a circular way, but the distances of them to the central island varies, depending on how far is the first land that they contact.

Their function is to send the player back to the original gateway in the central island that it links itself.

** Details **
The game first draws a line with a length of 1024 blocks from the center (0,0) through the north-west corner of the activated gateway. If the chunk at the end of the line contains any blocks above Y=15, the line is progressively shortened by 16 blocks until a chunk is found with no such blocks or the line reaches a length of 768. Then, if the chunk at the end of the line has no blocks above Y=15, the line is progressively lengthened by 16 blocks until a chunk is found with any such block or the line reaches a length of 1280.

Once a chunk is selected, it is scanned for any End stone blocks at or above Y=30 that have two non-full blocks[1] above. If such a block exists the south-east corner of the chunk is selected,[2] or if no such block exists in the chunk then a small island is generated at the end of the line at Y=75 and that position is selected. The position is then moved to the highest full block within Â±16 on the X and Z axes (favoring the north and west in case of ties) and a gateway structure is generated 10 blocks above that position.

Knowing this, the position of the exit gateway can be manipulated. However, once an End gateway on the central island has been activated, it is indefinitely linked to the position of the generated gateway on the outer island. Changing the position of the outer gateway is then no longer possible.
