# Server
Minecraft servers allow players to play online or via a local area network with other people. Internally, the game runs a server for single-player games, this was done in order to make the single-player game experience consistent with the multiplayer experience and make it so that changes made to the game such as bug fixes apply to both single-player games and multiplayer games.  Official server software is only available on Java Edition in the release state. The Bedrock Edition server software is currently in Alpha.

## Types of servers
See also: Tutorials/Playing on servers

Multiple archetypes of Minecraft servers exist, distinguished by the unique gameplay features, rules, and societal structures that they implement. No two servers are the same, and frequently the line between archetypes is blurred or indistinguishable. Many special types of servers rely on the use of map editors or the Creative game mode to build custom maps and the CraftBukkit server software to provide additional features. Some of these servers are more PVP orientated, some involve aspects of Survival, Creative and Adventure mode, some have a built-in economy, and some of them contain built-in minigames.

Some server types are:

- Survival: These servers are servers that use only survival mode. They are similar to Anarchy Servers, except there are usually rules, and usually prohibit Griefing and Exploiting.
- Creative: These are servers that only use Creative mode. Usually, servers give the players Creative, but limit the items they can access and/or limit the plot size. This is usually done to prevent griefing to other players' plots and to prevent excessive lagspikes.
- Minigame: These are servers that host multiple minigames (such as spleef, capture the flag, missile-, bed- and sky wars and more).
- Anarchy: These servers have no rules at all. Many players engage in cheating, exploiting, and use of vulgar language.
- Faction: Similar in concept to Survival servers, but claims are used to mark land as "yours". Untrusted players cannot build on "your" land.
- Personal/Private: These are servers that players can make on their own. Usually, the link is private, shared only with the user's close friends.
- Hardcore: The same as survival mode, except players only have one life. This typically ends with a "last man standing" scenario, This type of server is mainly used in SkyWars and Survival Games.
- Roleplay:These servers have their players acting as their own persona, sometimes being dictated by the Roleplay that is happening.
- City build:Here usually plots can be claimed to build cities on them.
- Sky block:On sky block one starts with just a few blocks above the void and then farms their way up.
- War Gear, War Ship and Air Ship:Modes where one spends time building vanilla fighting machines on build servers and can try them out in the arena.
- Modded servers:Servers can be modded to provide a playing experience very different to to the vanilla game.

## Hosting a server
There are many tools provided for players to be able to manage and host a server. Note that servers have requirements in order to run efficiently and smoothly.

- The default multiplayer softwareis free of charge and is available by Mojang Studios for Windows, macOS, and Unix-like systems (Linux, BSD...). See theMinecraft multiplayer server tutorialand Mojang Studios'Minecraft multiplayer server downloadpage for help.
- Opening a world to LANprovides a server that is accessible only to other people on the local network unless port forwarding is set up on the router. See thesetting up a LAN world tutorialfor more information.
- Custom server softwaresuch as CraftBukkit, Spigot, and Sponge provide players a way to add plugins to a server. These are generally used for larger servers that run plugins to ensuregrieferprotection, non-vanilla commands (e.g./sethome), custom minigames, etc.
- Rented serversare servers hosted externally by another company. These hosted servers are (usually) not provided free of charge - the player must rent them on a regular basis.
- Realmsare Mojang Studios' official hosting service that allows a limited number of players onto a server. Note that the Java Realms are still separate from Realms for other versions ofMinecraft.
- Dedicated Serversare servers that provide a wider range of power sources. These servers are much more flexible and allow for almost complete control.
