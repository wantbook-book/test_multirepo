# Data pack
The data pack system provides a way for players to further customize their Minecraft experience. Data packs can be used to override or add new advancements, dimensions, functions, loot tables, predicates, item modifiers, recipes, structures, tags, damage types, world generation settings, and biomes without any code modification.

## Usage
Data packs can be placed in the .minecraft/saves/(world)/datapacks folder of a world. Each data pack is either a sub-folder or a .zip file within the datapacks folder. After it is in the folder, a data pack is enabled for that world when the world is reloaded or loaded.

Data packs load their data based on the load order. This order can be seen and altered by using the /datapack command and is stored in the level.dat file.

The player can also select data packs at the world creation screen by clicking the Data Packs button and dragging-and-dropping their data pack folders/zip-files there. This is similar to the resource pack selection screen, and allows the player to enable data packs before the world is generated, and easily customize the load order too.

More than one directory for different namespaces may exist under the data directory.

### pack.mcmeta
A data pack is identified by Minecraft based on the presence of the pack.mcmeta file in the root directory of the data pack, which contains data in JSON format.

- The root object.
	- pack: Holds the data pack information.
		- description: AJSON textthat appears when hovering over the data pack's name in the list given by the/datapack listcommand, or when viewing the pack in the Create World screen.
		- pack_format: Pack version. If this number does not match the current required number, the data pack displays a warning and requires additional confirmation to load the pack. SeeÂ§ Pack formatfor a full list of pack format numbers.
		- supported_formats: (Optional) Describes a range for pack formats that this pack supports.  Examples:16,[16,17],{"min_inclusive": 16, "max_inclusive": 17}
	- filter: (Optional) Section for filtering out files from data packs applied below this one. Any file that matches one of the patterns insideblockis treated as if it was not present in the pack at all.
		- block: List of patterns
			- 
				- namespace: Aregular expressionfor the namespace of files to be filtered out. If unspecified, it applies to every namespace.
				- path: Aregular expressionfor the paths of files to be filtered out. If unspecified, it applies to every file.
	- overlays: (Optional) Section for specifying the overlays, which are sub-packs applied over the "normal" contents of a pack. Their directories have their own assets and data directories, and are placed in the pack's root directory.
		- entries: List of overlays. The order is important, as the first in the list is applied first.
			- 
				- formats: Describes a range for pack formats when this overlay should be active.  Examples:16,[16,17],{"min_inclusive": 16, "max_inclusive": 17}
				- directory: The directory to overlay for the respective versions (allowed characters:a-z,0-9,_and-).

pack.mcmeta, as used by the "vanilla" data pack in 1.20.4, as found in the client and official server jars:

pack.mcmeta
{
    "pack": {
        "description": "The default data for Minecraft",
        "pack_format": 26
    }
}
