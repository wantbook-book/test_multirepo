# Block of Copper
A block of copper is a block that oxidizes over time, gaining a verdigris appearance over four stages. They can be prevented from oxidizing by being waxed with honeycombs. Non-oxidized, non-waxed blocks of copper are storage blocks equivalent to nine copper ingots.

## Obtaining
### Breaking
Blocks of copper can be mined only with a stone pickaxe or better; otherwise, it drops nothing.

1. ↑Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

### Natural generation

  

This section describes an experimental feature in Java Edition and Bedrock Edition. 
This feature is not enabled in-game by default and requires enabling the "Update 1.21" experimental data pack in Java Edition or the "Update 1.21" setting in the "Experiments" section in Bedrock Edition.


Waxed blocks of copper and waxed oxidized copper generate naturally in trial chambers.

### Crafting

### Waxing
Blocks of copper can be turned into the respective waxed copper blocks by using a honeycomb item on them. Waxed copper blocks do not oxidize and are identical to the non-waxed version.

### Scraping
Using an axe on a waxed block of copper turns it into the respective non-waxed block of copper. In addition, using an axe on an exposed, weathered, or oxidized block of copper reverts it one stage to a regular, exposed, or weathered copper block respectively.

### Lightning strike
Non-waxed blocks of copper are completely deoxidized when struck by lightning, and other non-waxed blocks of copper nearby are deoxidized randomly.

## Usage
Blocks of copper can be used to store copper ingots in a compact fashion. Exposed, weathered, and oxidized variants cannot be crafted back into copper ingots, but the unoxidized waxed block variant can. Unlike the cut variant, blocks of copper cannot be crafted directly into slabs or stairs without a stonecutter. Stonecutting blocks of copper gives four times more products than typical for stone, and allows slabs and stairs to be obtained.
