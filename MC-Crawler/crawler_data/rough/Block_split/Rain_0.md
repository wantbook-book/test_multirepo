## Behavior
Rain is a semi-common temporary, global occurrence[1] that can happen randomly at any time within the Overworld. In colder biomes, and at certain altitudes, it snows instead. No rain occurs in warmer biomes such as deserts and savannas, as well as in other dimensions.

The average rainfall lasts 0.5–1 Minecraft day, and there is a 0.5–7.5 day delay between rains. Rain has a small chance to worsen into a thunderstorm.

Rainy weather always clears at sunrise after sleeping in a bed. Otherwise, it stops after a random duration of time.

In Bedrock Edition, rain can fall tilted,[verify] and snow particles can fall twisting, bending, and moving around. In Java Edition rain and snow fall straight down.

The sun is not visible during rain although the sunrise afterglow is visible.
Rainfalls darken the world, causing the light from the sun to decrease by 3, bringing it to light level 12 in full daylight. Moonlight, however, is not reduced, and remains at light level 4. The sky itself darkens, even in biomes where it does not rain, and in Java Edition, celestial bodies (the sun, moon, and stars) are no longer visible.[2] In Bedrock Edition, the sun and moon are still visible in biomes with no rain. While flying, rain also decreases visibility on land. Clouds darken from white to light gray, although clouds themselves do not precipitate. Although the sun is not visible during rain, the glow associated with sunrise and sunset is still visible.

Rain extinguishes fires (including flaming arrows[3]), although it does not extinguish lit campfires or fires on netherrack or magma blocks.[4] Rain does not solidify lava, and does not empty lava cauldrons. Mobs on fire are quenched on contact with rain, preventing skeletons, strays, zombies, zombie villagers, drowned, and phantoms from burning during the day. During rain, drowned can leave bodies of water when chasing a target, as if it were night time. Endermen and snow golems may die due to their weakness to water; they take damage at a rate of 1 per half second. Endermen teleport randomly until they find a dry place. Blazes and striders that are brought into the Overworld also take damage on contact with rain.

At a certain biome-dependent elevation, the rain becomes snowfall, resulting in huge natural mountains having snow on the peaks while it is raining on the ground. Each biome has a certain temperature, and temperatures below 0.15 turn rain into snow. The temperature drops by 0.0016 per meter above sea level, so at high elevations, it can be cold enough to snow despite there normally being rain instead.

Other effects caused by rain:

- Whilefishing, there is a shorter wait time on average to get a bite during rain.[5]
- Wolvesshake themselves dry if they are not moving (certain versions only).
- Farmlandbecomes hydrated if it is not already.[6]
- Rain fills upcauldronswithwater, albeit slowly.
- Tridentsenchanted withRiptidecan be used on land.
- Tridents with theImpalingenchantment deal more damage during rain.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
- Villagersenter houses and stop their daily schedule.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
- Beesthat are outside return to their hives.
- Players are granted theConduit Powerstatus effect when within aconduit's range without having to be in the same body of water.
