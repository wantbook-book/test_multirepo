## Creation
In Survival mode, the player must venture to a stronghold to activate a pre-existing end portal, as end portal frame blocks cannot be obtained naturally. The portal is activated when an eye of ender has been placed in each of the end portal frame blocks, generating 9 end portal blocks within the structure. Eyes of ender cannot be removed from end portal frames.

In Creative mode, the player can construct an end portal by placing 12 end portal frames in a ring enclosing an open 3×3 square and placing an eye of ender in each one. In order to activate, the end portal frames must be oriented correctly; the front face of each portal block must be pointed inward toward the 3×3 portal area. This can be achieved by the player standing in the center of the portal area and rotating to place the frames in a ring around them.

The end portal blocks do not depend on the end portal frame to exist; thus, one may create standalone portals with commands or by breaking the frames.[1]

## Generation
End portals are found within the portal room of a stronghold, hanging horizontally over a pool of lava, with a staircase leading up to the portal. A monster spawner spawning silverfish sits in the staircase. Each individual end portal frame block has a 10% chance of containing an eye of ender, as determined by the world seed. This means there is a one in 1 trillion chance for all 12 end portal frames to contain an eye of ender, activating the portal upon initial generation. The frame has the highest probability of generating with only one eye of ender (37.7%), with probabilities dropping to 28.2% for zero, 23.0% for two, 8.52% for three, 2.13% for four, and a total of 0.433% for five or more. Because of the massive amount of possible seeds, over 8 million seeds in Java Edition that generate portals with 12 eyes of ender are known.[2]

## Behavior
Main article: End Portal (block)
Stepping into an activated end portal immediately opens up a loading screen and transports the player to the End — this leaves no time to back out, like entering a nether portal in Creative mode. Upon entering the End, a 5×5 horizontal platform of obsidian is generated centered at block coordinates (100, 48, 0), and the player is placed on top of it (100, 49, 0, facing west).

Entering an end portal does not reset falling velocity. If the player had fallen far enough to die of fall damage before hitting the portal, the player dies upon arrival in the End.[3]‌[Java Edition  only]

The end portal blocks emit a light level of 15—the brightest light level in game. Only one end portal block is needed to teleport to the End. End portal blocks can be placed anywhere with use of the /setblock and /fill commands, and they function as if they were a complete portal.

Activating the end portal destroys any blocks located in the center 3×3 square, including bedrock or another end portal frame. It destroys fluids, although if the source block is not also removed, then it immediately flows back through. If an end portal is generated on a monster spawner, the fire particles remain. The destruction of the blocks does not make any sound, and applicable blocks do not drop as resources (except for the top part of a door and the extended part of a vertical piston, which both destroy the whole object and drop them as resources). Events sometimes triggered by block destruction fail to occur; TNT simply disappears without detonating, and infested blocks fail to spawn a silverfish. However, containers still drop their contents. Mobs (except for the wither and ender dragon) enter the portal similarly to the player. If the player rides a minecart into an active end portal, the player enters the End only after exiting the minecart.

The sound for the opening of the portal is a global sound event, meaning it can be heard by all players in all dimensions. This can be disabled in Java Edition by setting the /gamerule globalSoundEvents to false.
