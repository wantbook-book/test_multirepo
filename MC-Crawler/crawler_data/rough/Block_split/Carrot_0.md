## Obtaining
### Breaking
See also: Fortune § Seeds

Fully grown carrot crops drop 2 to 5 carrots (3 5⁄7 per crop harvested on average). Yield can be increased using a tool enchanted with Fortune, with Fortune III harvesting an average of 5 3⁄7 carrots.

The yield is calculated by a binomial distribution: 2 drops are fixed, then a drop is attempted three times with a success rate of 57.14286% to yield the extra 0–3 drops. Each level of Fortune enchantment increases the number of attempts by one.

| Default  | 0.05                |

### Natural generation
Village farm plots have a chance of having carrots. The exact chance depends on the style of the village:

| Village style | Chance |
|---------------|--------|
| Plains        | 30%    |
| Snowy         | 10%    |

### Mob loot
Zombies, husks, and zombie villagers have a 2.5% (1⁄40) chance of dropping either an iron ingot, carrot, or potato when killed by a player or tamed wolf. This is increased by 1% (1⁄100) per level of looting. This gives carrots the following chances of dropping:

- 1⁄120(about 0.83%)
- 7⁄600(about 1.17%) with Looting I
- 9⁄600(about 1.50%) with Looting II
- 11⁄600(about 1.83%) with Looting III
