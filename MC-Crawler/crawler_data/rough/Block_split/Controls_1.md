### Semi-configurable controls
While aspects of these controls can be modified to an extent, full control over them is not possible

| W       | Sprint (secondary) | This is always the same as the current forward key. When pressed twice in quick succession, causes theplayertosprint(unless the character is toohungry). Attempting to sprint (Double-Tap) while fully submerged underwater initiates swimming. This functionality cannot be separated from the forward key. |

When Fly Mode is on, causes the player to gainaltitude(ascend). Player flies faster if sprinting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| LeftShift   | Sneak                          | key.sneak                 | Sneak. When Fly Mode is on, causes the player to losealtitude(descend).Holding Shift and pressing use on an usable block with a block in hand overrides the USE action and places the block instead. For example, using a lever on a block that would usually open an internal inventory (such as a dispenser) places the lever instead.Used to get off rideable entities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

For blocks, it is simply the block in item form. For mobs, the game places the corresponding spawn egg in the player's hand. This also works onboats, all types ofminecarts,paintings, andarmor stands‌[Java Edition  only][1]to get the entity in item form. If the item is in the hotbar, it switches the selected hotbar slot to the slot with that item. If the item is not in the hotbar, but in the player's inventory, it moves that item from the inventory into the hotbar. If no hotbar slot is empty, the item selected is replaced. In creative mode, if the item is not in the inventory, the game gives the player that item. This works only in creative mode for entities.‌[Java Edition  only][2]Hovering over an item in any inventory and clicking with the mouse wheel when in creative gives one full stack of that item. Dragging over slots of inventory/container while holding an item fills them with full stacks of copies of that item.If used on a tile entity while holding Ctrl, or ⌘ Cmd (for some Mac computers), the tile entity's nbt data are copied. The block given to the player has the Lore: (+NBT)‌[Java Edition  only] or (+DATA)‌[Bedrock Edition  only]..                |

This also means a player can punch an entity while eating/drinking, however the eating/drinking resets when a player presses Button 1.This button also uses items in the off-hand. Only items with a right click function can be used, and they are available only if the item in the main hand does not have a right click action, or its right click action cannot be performed. |

| Q           | Drop Selected Item             | key.drop                  | Drop/toss an item. Ifitemsare stacked, only one gets thrown/tossed/dropped. In recent versions of Java edition, holding the key causes single items to be dropped quickly from a stack. There is no actual "throw" command; "drop" (defaultQ) tosses anobjectapproximately 2 to 3blocksfrom the player.Eggs,ender pearls,eyes of ender, andsnowballscan be thrown by the "use" command (default right-clicking).Ctrl+Qdrops the whole stack of items. On Mac, even though most shortcuts use the command key,Ctrl+Qis still the "drop stack" bind.Note that there is no corresponding Pick Up command. Dropped items are picked up (if there is room in inventory/hotbar) by moving near them. Placed items are picked up by "mining" (e.g. chopping up a sign with an axe), when they behave as dropped items and can be picked up as such.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| F11         | Toggle Fullscreen              | key.fullscreen            | Toggles full-screen mode.When using some Apple keyboards, F11 must be pressed while holding Fn and Option to enter fullscreen. Using F11 alone toggles Exposé, and pressing F11 while holding Fn turns down the volume or vice versa, depending on system preferences.Some people are experiencing a bug while exiting from full-screen mode that causes an inescapable black screen. When that's the case, use Alt + Tab to switch out of Minecraft and switch it back to windowed mode.On Linux, mouse input is often buggy while in full-screen mode. After entering full-screen mode on Linux, the mouse typically restricts the player to a single 360-degree rotation. This can be fixed by hitting Esc to release the mouse then hitting Esc again to regrab it.Also, note that this may not respect multiple monitors and Minecraft may occupy all screens instead of the one it is active on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
