## Obtaining
The hanging roots generated along with the azalea tree.
### Breaking
Hanging roots can be destroyed with any tool or by hand instantly, but can only be collected using shears. In Bedrock Edition, any Silk Touch tool also works.

| Block    | Hanging roots       |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 0                   |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.05                |
| Shears   | 0.05                |

### Natural generation
Hanging roots can generate inside a lush cave beneath an azalea tree on the surface above.


### Post-generation
Using bone meal on rooted dirt causes hanging roots to grow below the block.

Hanging roots may be obtained by using a hoe on rooted dirt, transforming the rooted dirt into normal dirt in the process.

## Usage
They can only be placed on the underside of a block.

### Composting
Placing hanging roots into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
