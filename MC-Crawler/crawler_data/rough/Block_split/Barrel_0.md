# Barrel
A barrel is a solid block used to store items. Unlike a chest, it cannot connect to other barrels. It also serves as a fisherman's job site block.

1. ↑Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

### Natural generation
Empty barrels can generate naturally in fisher cottages in villages. Up to 3 barrels can generate in a village fisher cottage. Barrels with loot can be found in the trial chambers.

### Chest loot

## Usage
Barrels can be moved by pistons,‌[Bedrock Edition  only] water and lava flow around barrels without affecting them. Lava can create fire in air blocks next to barrels as if the barrel was flammable, but the barrel does not actually catch fire and can't be burned.

### Container
The GUI of the barrel.
Barrels have a container inventory with 27 slots, which is the same as a single chest. Unlike chests, a barrel can be placed below a solid block and still be able to be opened.
They can be filled by droppers and both filled and emptied by hoppers. When broken, barrels drop the contents of the container and the barrel item itself. 

To open the barrel interface, use the Use Item control. To move items between the barrel inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the barrel interface is open, drag or shift-click the items. Holding Shift and double-clicking while holding an item moves all items of the type clicked on in or out of the barrel to the extent that space is available for them.‌[Java Edition  only] To exit the barrel interface, use the Esc control.

By default, the interface of a barrel is labeled "Barrel". A barrel's GUI label can be changed by naming the barrel in an anvil before placing it or by using the /data command‌[Java Edition  only] (for example, to label a barrel at (0,64,0) as "Bonus Barrel!", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'"Bonus Barrel!"'}).

In Java Edition, a barrel can be "locked" by setting its Lock tag using the /data command. If a barrel's Lock tag is not blank, the barrel cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. For example, to lock a barrel at (0,64,0) so that the barrel cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named "Barrel Key", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:"Barrel Key"}.
