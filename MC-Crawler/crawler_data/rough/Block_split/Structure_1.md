### Underwater structures
Note that ocean ruins and shipwrecks sometimes generate above water on shores, and icebergs are partially above and below water.

The Nether, though equally vast, contains far fewer structures than the Overworld.

## The End
Main article: The End
The End is the final and most barren dimension, with no structures on its main island. After defeating the ender dragon, gateways to the outer islands are created.

## Structure-like features
Main article: Feature
These worldgen features have similarities to structures but they are not true structures. Instead, they are coded and generated the same way as trees or ores. This is why they generate even when the "Generate structures" world option is disabled, and also cannot be located with the /locate command.
