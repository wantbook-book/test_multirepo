## Method
1. Based on images, plans, Google Maps, and other available materials, a base Minecraft model of the public space is produced by UN-Habitat.
2. UN-Habitat arranges for a Minecraft expert to provide Minecraft training and support.
3. Community participation workshops are held with youth, project staff, and partners in order to:

- Train participants in the basics of Minecraft modeling
- Facilitate dialogue on issues regarding the public space
- Produce Minecraft models incorporating the proposed design ideas
- Collate the ideas that are included in the models

After that,

1. The participants are briefed and divided into groups of 2-4 people, with one computer provided for each group.
2. The participants are given sufficient time to develop their ideas in Minecraft. Depending on the level of prior IT and Minecraft knowledge, two to four days is recommended.
3. The participants present their Minecraft models to stakeholders – including urban professionals, policymakers, government officials, and UN-Habitat staff. The designs are discussed through a deliberation process and final designs are agreed upon among stakeholders.
4. The Minecraft proposals are used to feed into professional design work and budget processes.
