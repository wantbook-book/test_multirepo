## Blocks
Only few blocks can exhibit true animations. While many blocks have states that can be changed via interactions or otherwise, these are usually instantaneous flips with no continuous transformation between them. Examples of blocks capable of animation include:

- Chests,trapped chestsandender chests, whose lids are on a hinge and which open and close
- Shulker boxes, when opened or closed
- Pistonsandsticky pistons, alongside any attached blocks, when expanding or contracting
- Conduits, when active
- Enchanting tablebooks
