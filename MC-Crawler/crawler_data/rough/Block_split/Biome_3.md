#### Arid-land biomes
In these biomes, it neither rains or snows at all, but the sky still turns overcast during inclement weather. The surface is covered with sparse vegetation.

These biomes are further divided into three categories: deserts, savannas and badlands.

| Desert            | A barren and inhospitable biome consisting mostly of sand dunes, dead bushes and cacti. Sandstone and sometimes fossils are found underneath the sand. The only passive mobs that spawn naturally in deserts are gold/creamy rabbits, their coloring well-camouflaged against the sand. At night, husks usually spawn in the place of normal zombies; the lack of visual obstruction makes hostile mobs highly visible. Sugar cane can be found if the desert is next to a river biome. Desert villages, desert wells and desert pyramids are found exclusively in this biome. Pillager outposts can also generate here.                                                                                                                                                                                        | Desert            |
| Savanna           | A relatively flat and dry biome with a dull-brown grass color and acacia trees scattered around the biome, though oak trees may generate now and then. Tall grass covers the landscape. Villages can generate in this biome, constructed of acacia wood, with some stained terracotta. Pillager outposts can also generate here. Horses, llamas‌[BE  only], and armadillos‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80] can naturally spawn here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Savanna           |
| Savanna Plateau   | This biome generates when a normal savanna biome spawns at high altitudes and near mountains. It is mostly indistinguishable from the standard savanna with the main differences being the fact that llamas, armadillos‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80] and wolves‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80] can spawn and villages and pillager outposts can't generate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Savanna plateau   |
| Windswept Savanna | Unlike the mostly flat and calm terrain of the savanna biome, this uncommon variant generates in chaotic terrain covered in gigantic mountains covered in coarse dirt and some patch of stone. The mountains in the windswept savanna biome are extremely steep, jutting out at 90-degree angles, making it almost impossible to climb. Ocean-like lakes also generate here. On top of that, they can reach heights comparable to the mountain peak biomes - they can rise above the clouds. Massive waterfalls and lavafalls are quite common here. The unforgiving terrain means villages and outposts do not generate in this biome. Armadillos‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80] can naturally spawn here, as well as llamas in Bedrock Edition.                                                           | Windswept savanna |
| Badlands          | An uncommon biome where large mounds of terracotta and stained terracotta generate. Red sand also generates here instead of regular sand, with occasional cacti and dead bushes. This biome is usually found alongside desert biomes and it can generate in mountainous terrain. No passive mobs spawn in this biome, even if all other spawning conditions are met. Mineshafts generate at a higher altitude than normal - occasionally a player may come across a mineshaft jutting out of the badlands. Gold ore also occurs more frequently, because additional blobs can generate within badlands up to Y=256. The composition of this biome is useful when other sources of terracotta and gold are scarce. The only passive mob that can spawn here is the armadillo‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80]. | Badlands          |
| Wooded Badlands   | The wooded badlands has layers of coarse dirt and forests of oak trees that generate atop the badlands in humid areas. The color of the grass and leaves is a dull green-brown hue, giving it a dried and dead appearance. These trees are a rare source of wood when living in the otherwise barren and lifeless badlands. ‌In Java Edition 1.20.5 and Bedrock Edition 1.20.80‌[upcoming], wolves and armadillos are the only mobs that can spawn here during the day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Wooded badlands   |
| Eroded Badlands   | This rare variant generates unique terrain features that are similar to the structures in Utah's Bryce Canyon. Tall and narrow spires of colorful terracotta rise out of the floor of the canyon, which like all other badlands variants, is covered in red sand. The only mob that can spawn here is the armadillo‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Eroded badlands   |

#### Cave biomes
These biomes generates inside caves in the Overworld. They're mostly found underground but can sometimes leak out of cave entrances.

| Deep Dark       | A dimly lit cave biome that generates deep underground mostly within the deepslate layer. It is largely sculk blocks 1 block thick upon all surfaces, with frequent sculk sensors and occasional sculk shriekers of which the latter can directly summon the warden (or multiple wardens). An ancient city is a large structure which can generate here, including a warden-like city center generated structure (and valuable chests with unique loot, including a high chance of finding enchanted golden apples, which are widely considered to be one of the rarest items in the game). As with mushroom fields, no other hostile mobs spawn here. While breaking sculk blocks, which can even be generated via mobs dying near a sculk catalyst, can be a good source of experience, the very high chance of instant death from a nearly unkillable warden (with a ranged attack) means that this is probably the most dangerous place in the Overworld to attempt this way of leveling-up. | Deep dark       |
| Dripstone Caves | These are caves filled with dripstone blocks and pointed dripstone both hanging as stalactites and growing from the ground as stalagmites and small water wells of 1×1 in the ground. Large dripstone clusters structures generate occasionally inside these caves. Copper ore blobs found in this biome are much bigger compared to other biomes. Drowned are able to spawn in aquifers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Dripstone caves |
| Lush Caves      | Lush caves are often found underground below azalea trees. As the name suggests, these caves are lush and covered by moss blocks, moss carpets, short grass and azalea bushes on the floors. On the ceiling, vines and cave vines with glow berries grow down and light up the caves, and spore blossoms grow from the ceiling and spore particles. There are also shallow lakes with clay where dripleaf plants grow out of them and axolotls spawn, making this the only biome where they can spawn. Tropical fish can also spawn inside the aquifers in a lush cave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Lush caves      |
