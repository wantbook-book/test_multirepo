## Obtaining
### Breaking
An element can be broken instantly using any item, always dropping itself.

### Element constructor
Elements and isotopes are primarily obtained by constructing them in the element constructor. This is done by moving the sliders or typing in numbers into the text inputs. The large display shows the selected numbers of particles arranged in an atomic structure, whether valid or not. If the atomic structure is a stable isotope, it can be taken out of the slot on the right side. A list of stable isotopes can be found below.

### Material reducer
Several elements can also be obtained from a material reducer, which breaks down blocks into their component elements by percentage. This is the only way of obtaining the Unknown element; a mysterious element found in certain Minecraft blocks, such as soul sand and netherrack.

Because the element constructor and material reducer cannot be obtained in Survival without commands, and the world must have “Education Edition” enabled, the same is true for elements. In Bedrock Edition, the “Education Edition” option also allows elements to be obtained directly via commands or Creative inventory.
