Charred baked potato bricks take a very long time to mine due to their extremely high hardness. Even using a golden hoe with Efficiency V and a Haste II effect, mining them still takes almost 30 seconds. However, unlike other blocks with high hardness (e.g. trial spawners, reinforced deepslate), charred baked potato bricks drop as an item when mined.
