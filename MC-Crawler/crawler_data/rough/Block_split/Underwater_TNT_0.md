## Obtaining
### Breaking
Underwater TNT can be broken instantly with any tool, or without a tool. However, primed underwater TNT cannot be broken, as it is an entity.

### Crafting

## Usage
Main article: TNT § Usage
Underwater TNT blocks can be activated the same way as a normal TNT block.

### Behavior
Once activated, it explodes like a normal TNT block. However, unlike the traditional TNT block, it can damage blocks underwater. It can still explode in the air, although it does not work in lava. Underwater TNT has the same delayed detonation rate as normal TNT.
