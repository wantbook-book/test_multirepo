## Appearance
Dark oak trees generate with thick 2×2 trunks. Dirt blocks appear under the trunk if generated on a steep cliff. Dark oak trees nearly always generate with irregular logs connected to the trunk – these represent large branches.

Dark oak trees with trunks consisting of 1×1 dark oak logs, instead of 2×2, can be found in two types of rooms in woodland mansions: the tree chopping room, and the nature room. These are not generated elsewhere in the world, and cannot be grown from saplings.

- Tree chopping room.
- Nature room.

## Generation
Dark oaks spawn naturally only in the dark forest biome. A dark oak always generates with dirt under its trunk, even if it spawns partly or wholly over air or water blocks.

## Blocks and items
These items can be obtained from all variants of dark oak:

- Dark Oak Log(harvested with any tool including hands)
- Dark Oak Leaves(harvested withshears)
- Stick(chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
- Dark Oak Planks(created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
- Stripped Dark Oak Log(created byusinganaxeon a log)
- Dark Oak Sapling(chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
- Apple(chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
- Vines‌[Bedrock Edition  only](harvested withshearsfrom a dying tree)

## Planting
Dark oak saplings can be planted on:

- Dirt
- Grass Block
- Coarse Dirt
- Podzol
- Mycelium
- Rooted Dirt
- Moss Block
- Farmland
- Mud
- Muddy Mangrove Roots

Growing these trees requires four dark oak saplings arranged in a 2×2 grid; they do not grow if planted individually. Dark oak trees grow at a much faster rate than most other trees. They require a 3×3 column of unobstructed space at least 7 blocks above the sapling to grow (8 blocks including the sapling itself). This column is centered on the northwestern sapling. Additionally, dark oak trees require 5×5 layers without obstruction for the top 3 layers of its final height. No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree (saplings planted in a 2×2 hole 1 block deep still grow).

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition and  Minecraft Education. 


In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, dark oaks can generate as a dying tree. Dying dark oaks generate naturally, and can be grown from normal saplings.[1][2] A dying dark oak has the standard growth pattern of any other tree, however, all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with vines.
