1. ↑ a b c dThe stripping must be done with an axe, which is not counted
2. ↑ a b cRequires the burning of wood into charcoal in a furnace, which needs 8 cobblestone and burning material. The cobblestone and fuel are ignored for the purpose of this conversion.
3. ↑Assumed to be crafted from logs rather than wood blocks.
4. ↑Assumed to be crafted from logs or stems rather than wood or hyphae blocks.
5. ↑ a bBecause one plank cannot be crafted into two sticks, this crafting recipe requires two wood or hyphae for two units.

### Smelting ingredient
| Name     | Ingredients                               | Smelting recipe |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Charcoal | AnyLogor<br/>AnyStripped Log+<br/>Anyfuel | 0.15            |

### Fuel
Logs, but not stems, can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.

### Axes
Using an axe on a log or stem turns it into a stripped log or a stripped stem, which act the same as regular logs.

### Cocoa beans
Cocoa beans can be placed on the side of jungle logs to grow a new cocoa pod.

### Note blocks
Logs and stems can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sounds.
