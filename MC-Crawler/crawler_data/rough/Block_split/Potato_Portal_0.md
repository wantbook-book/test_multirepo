## Obtaining
Potato portals are unobtainable as an item without the use of the Creative inventory or commands. When kept in the inventory, the item goes visually outside the slot. They cannot be pushed or pulled by pistons and have a blast resistance of -1, meaning they are destroyed extremely easily by explosions. 

### Breaking
Potato portals are unbreakable in Survival mode.

| Block    | Potato portal       |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | ∞                   |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | ∞                   |

### Post-generation
To enter the Potato dimension, a poisonous potato must be used on a pedestal block to create a portal. Alternatively, potato portals can be created with the potato staff dropped by the mega spud boss mob in the Potato dimension.

## Usage
After standing inside the portal for 4 seconds, player is transported to the Potato dimension if they were in Overworld, or vice versa. Other entities are transported instantly.
