#### Applying dye to cauldron water

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition. 


In Bedrock Edition, leather armor is dyed through a cauldron, so a cauldron can hold dyed water. Using a dye on a cauldron filled with water colors the water, consuming the dye. Different dyes may be added to produce mixed colors. Using leather armor or leather horse armor on the cauldron dyes that item the color of the water, reducing the water in the cauldron by one level for each item dyed.

Attempting to add water, lava or potion to dyed water empties the cauldron.

#### Holding lava
Cauldron filled with lava
Cauldrons can be used to hold lava. In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, when a cauldron is already filled with water, it empties the cauldron and makes an extinguishing sound. A cauldron filled with lava emits a light level of 15, similar to lava, and burns any entity inside of it; in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, this includes mobs that do not take damage from lava like zombified piglins.

Lava inside a cauldron does not interact with water outside of the cauldron. The lava disappears upon putting water in the cauldron.

A redstone comparator with a lava cauldron behind it outputs redstone signal strength of 3.[10][11]

A cauldron placed below a down-facing pointed dripstone that has lava placed a block above it slowly fills with lava.

If a cauldron is filled by lava, using glass bottles on the cauldron does nothing.

#### Holding powder snow
Powder snow is currently the only solid material that can be stored in a cauldron. A cauldron slowly fills with powder snow during snowfall, if starting empty or with any layer of powder snow already inside. Up to three‌[JE  only] or six‌[BE  only] layers can be filled. When the cauldron is full, interacting using a bucket, creates a powder snow bucket and empties the cauldron. Entities standing in the cauldron do not take freeze damage, and entities wearing leather boots still fall through the powder snow.

A redstone comparator with a powder snow cauldron behind it outputs a redstone signal strength proportional to the fill level, up to 3.

Contrary to a cauldron filled with water, a powder snow cauldron that is not full cannot be filled up with a powder snow bucket, as using the bucket on the cauldron instead places powder snow against it.

#### Holding potions

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition and  Minecraft Education. 


In Bedrock Edition, a cauldron can hold normal potions, splash potions and lingering potions. Using a potion on a cauldron empties the potion and increases the level of the potion in the cauldron by two levels. A glass bottle can then be used on a cauldron with a potion in it, filling the bottle with that potion. This reduces the potion in the cauldron by two levels. If there is only one level of potion remaining, it cannot be retrieved using a bottle and must be either replaced or used to tip an arrow.

Using an arrow on a cauldron that contains a potion transforms the arrow into a tipped arrow with that potion effect, and reduces the potion in the cauldron by one level. Tipping multiple arrows at once can be more efficient, and it may use more than one level at once. 1 level of potion tips up to 16 arrows, 2 levels up to 32, 3 levels up to 48, and 4 levels up to a full stack of arrows, resulting in 21.33 tipped arrows per potion. The bottom three levels of a cauldron are only counted as a single level for the purposes of tipping arrows, therefore any quantity of arrows that would leave less than three levels of potion remaining when tipped empties the cauldron completely.

Attempting to put water, lava or a different potion into a cauldron with a potion causes an explosion sound, and the cauldron is emptied.

An entity that stands in a cauldron filled to any level with any potion does not receive the effect of the potion.

Using an empty bucket on a cauldron filled with any potion does nothing, as the bucket remains empty and the potion in the cauldron does not empty.

### Removing dye from items
A cauldron with water can wash the dye off of leather armor and shulker boxes, and can remove the top-most pattern layer of a banner, by pressing use on the cauldron with the leather armor, shulker box, or banner in hand. Each wash reduces the water in the cauldron by one level. The water does not become dyed while removing dye from objects.
