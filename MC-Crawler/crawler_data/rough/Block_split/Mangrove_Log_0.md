# Log
A log or stem is a naturally occurring block found in trees or huge fungi, primarily used as a building block, and to create planks, a versatile crafting ingredient. It comes in ten types: oak, spruce, birch, jungle, acacia, dark oak, mangrove, cherry blossom, crimson and warped. You can sometimes also obtain oak logs in mine shafts.

### Breaking
Logs and stems can be broken by hand, but using an axe speeds up the process. Logs and stems drop themselves when broken with any tool.
