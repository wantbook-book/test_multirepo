An other portal is built as a vertical, rectangular frame of glowstone (4×5 minimum, 23×23 maximum). The four corners of the frame are not required. Adjacent portals can share glowstone blocks. An other portal cannot be built horizontally like an end portal.

Once a frame is constructed, it is activated by water placed inside the frame. This creates portal blocks inside the frame, resembling a vortex. The water can be placed in any manner, including use of water bucket, dispensed by dispenser or natural spread of water. Other portals can be activated only in the Overworld; they cannot be activated in the End and custom dimensions.

The water must be the last placed block in the structure—a water in an incomplete frame does not result in the portal activating upon the placement of the last glowstone block.

## Behavior
Main article: Other Portal (block)
When a player in the Overworld or the Nether stands in an other portal block for 4 seconds, the player is teleported 500 blocks in the air and Error 404 Terrain Not Found appears in the chat. The player can step out of a portal before it completes its animation to abort the teleport. However, in Creative, the wait time is one game tick (1⁄20 second) for the player to transfer between dimensions.

Most entities can travel through portals, including mobs (except the wither and ender dragon), thrown items, and transportation without passengers (neither mobs nor player)[1], including boats, minecarts and horses. Unlike players, other entities travel through portals instantly, and once they reach the other side, there is a cool-down time for 300 game ticks (15 seconds), in which they cannot go through any other portals. Therefore, an entity can only travel though other portals again, once it is not touching any other portal for 15 seconds.
