Flowers are non-solid plants that occur in a variety of shapes and colors. They are primarily used for decoration and crafted into dyes.

## Obtaining
### Breaking
A flower can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself. A flower also breaks if water runs over its location, or if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location.

### Natural generation
See also: Vegetation

Most flowers generate naturally on dirt and grass blocks as part of vegetation features in most biomes. Flowers can generate even if the biome is covered with snow. The tables in § Flower biomes show the types of small flowers that can naturally spawn in each biome when a new chunk is generated, as well as the flowers that can spawn when bone meal is used on grass blocks.

Sunflowers generate in sunflower plains; lilacs, rose bushes, and peonies can be found in forests, flower forests, birch forests, old growth birch forests, and dark forests.

Wither roses, torchflowers and pitcher plants do not generate naturally at all.

Natural dandelions are found in plains and savanna villages; poppies in plains, savanna, taiga, and snowy plains‌[BE  only] villages; oxeye daisies, cornflowers, and azure bluets in plains villages. Potted dandelions, poppies, blue orchids, alliums, azure bluets, red and white tulips, and oxeye daisies can be found in woodland mansions.

### Flower biomes
Flowers marked "Natural generation only" can only spawn when the chunk is initially generated, not when using bone meal; flowers marked "Bone meal only" cannot generate naturally, but can be created by players using bone meal on a grass block in that biome (§ Post-generation for more details).

Dandelions and poppies in jungles, bamboo jungles, sparse jungles, savannas and savanna plateaus (but not windswept savanna) are twice as common as in other biomes.

Some biomes - such as deserts - are technically enabled to generate vegetation features containing flowers, but do not generate dirt or grass blocks on the surface in regular worlds. This means that flowers are normally not generated in these biomes in regular worlds. Flowers can still be grown in these biomes by using bone meal on grass blocks, and they can generate naturally if a dirt or grass block surface is provided in custom superflats or custom worlds.

1. ↑ a bThis biome is technically enabled to generate flower vegetation features, but they normally fail to generate due to the lack of grass blocks on the surface. Players can still grow flowers using bone meal.
2. ↑ a bThis includes biomes - such as desert - that are technically enabled to generate flower vegetation features, but lack grass blocks on the surface in normal worlds. Players can still grow flowers there using bone meal.
3. ↑Generates as part of the flower gradient, and separately as part of "forest flower" patches. Can be grown with bone meal only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient.
