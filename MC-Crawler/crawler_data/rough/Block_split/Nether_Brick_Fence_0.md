## Usage
Main article: Fence § Usage
Nether brick fences are non-flammable and have the same blast resistance as most stone blocks. Nether Brick fences have the same usages as regular fences to form barriers and attaching mobs with a lead.

### Barrier
Nether brick fences connect to most blocks, including wooden fence gates, but not wooden fences.

### Note Blocks
Nether brick fences can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass drum" sound.
