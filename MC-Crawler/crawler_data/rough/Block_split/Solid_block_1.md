Many blocks are less than 1 meter wide on one or more sides.

The table below shows the widths of various blocks. If a block has several hit boxes of different sizes (for example: brewing stands), then each hitbox is listed separately. Blocks with sides of different widths are listed with cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) for each side, assuming that the block was placed from above, with the player facing north.

1. ↑ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r sThese blocks are also thinner, i.e. their length and width are less than that of a full block.
2. ↑Soul sand has inner collision boxes every eighth of a block, so there is a collision box at 1/8, 1/4, 3/8, 1/2, 5/8, and 3/4.
