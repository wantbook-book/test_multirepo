Main article: April Fools' Day jokes
- Mojang has made several April Fools' Day jokes:
	- In2010,Minecraft 4Dwas supposed to release as a video on Notch's YouTube channel. It was cancelled because Notch was moving offices.
	- In2011, thelocked chestor "Steve Co. Supply Crate" was temporarily added which "allowed" various micro-transactions in the game.
	- In2013, Mojang releasedMinecraft 2.0which contained features such aspink withersandredstone bugs.[233]
	- In2014, the default sounds were replaced with a voice (specifically, that of ElementAnimation, a YouTuber group known for making several popular videos aboutMinecraft) saying the name of the sound's source, the music was replaced with a rendition of the title theme of the TV seriesGame of Thrones(consisting of the word "door" repeated to the tune of the music), and everyone's skins were replaced with modified versions of the villager textures, edited to fit the player model. This was all blamed on thevillagers.
	- In2015, Mojang released15w14a, which made all the mobs in the game friendly and loving.
	- In2016, Mojang released1.RV-Pre1, which added trendy items of 2016.
