## Obtaining
### Breaking
Froglights drop as an item when broken with any tool or by hand. Breaking speed is always the same; no specific tool can break a froglight faster.[1]

| Block    | Froglight           |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 0.3                 |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.45                |

### Mob loot
Main article: Tutorials/Froglight farming
A tiny magma cube drops a froglight when it is eaten by a frog. There are three colors of froglight that drop depending on what type of frog kills the magma cube:

| Frog type | Froglight color |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Warm      | Pearlescent     |
| Temperate | Ochre           |
| Cold      | Verdant         |

## Usage
Froglights have a smooth texture and are used as light sources. They emit light level 15, the highest level possible for a light-emitting block. Froglights also melt snow layers within 3 blocks and ice within 4 blocks (taxicab distance).

Froglights can be placed in three different orientations, similar to logs and basalt.
