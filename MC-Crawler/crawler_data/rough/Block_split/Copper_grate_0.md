## Obtaining
### Breaking
Copper grates can be mined only with a stone pickaxe or greater. If a copper grate is mined without the use of a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

## Usage
Copper grates are decorative semi-transparent blocks that can oxidize. Copper grates do not conduct redstone, and mobs cannot spawn on top of them. They can also be waterlogged.

Copper grates adjacent to other copper grates are invisible when viewed through a copper grate that is identical in states of oxidation and wax.

### Oxidation
Main article: Oxidation
Non-waxed copper grates have four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). Lightning bolts and axes can remove the oxidation on copper grates. Using a honeycomb on a copper grate prevents it from oxidizing.

As the block begins to oxidize (exposed), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized), the block is teal with several green spots.
