###  Redstone component
When placed in the world, redstone dust becomes a block of redstone wire, which can transmit redstone power.

#### Placement
Examples of redstone wire configuration. Top Left: Redstone wire connects diagonally vertically through non-opaque blocks. Top Right: Redstone wire does not connect diagonally vertically through opaque blocks. Center: Redstone wire gets darker as its power level drops, to a maximum of 15 blocks from a power source.
Examples of redstone wire placements.
Redstone dust can be placed on opaque blocks as well as glowstone, upside-down slabs, glass, upside-down stairs, and hoppers. It can also be placed on some transparent blocks; see Opacity/Placement for more information. It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.[1]

Redstone wire configures itself to point toward adjacent redstone power components and transmission component connection points. Redstone wire also configures itself to point toward adjacent redstone wire one block higher or lower – unless there is a solid opaque block above the lower redstone wire.

If there is only one such adjacent redstone component, redstone wire configures itself into a  line pointing both at the neighbor and away from it. If there are two or more such adjacent components, redstone wire connects them in the form of , , , or  as needed.

When there are no adjacent components, a single redstone wire configures itself into a  plus sign, which can provide power in all four directions. By right-clicking, it can be changed into a  dot, which does not provide power to any of the four directions.

Redstone wire does not automatically configures itself to point toward mechanism components; the only exception are the back and side faces of pistons and sticky pistons in Bedrock Edition. If such a configuration is desired, the other neighbors of the redstone wire must be arranged to create it, i.e the redstone dust must be placed in a way that it would be pointed at the block’s location even if it were not there.

When redstone wire is reconfigured after placement, it does not update other redstone components around it of the change unless that reconfiguration also includes a change in power level or another component provides an update. This can create situations where a mechanism component remains activated when it shouldn't, or vice versa, until it receives an update from something else – a "feature" of redstone wire that can be used to make a block update detector.
