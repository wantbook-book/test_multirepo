setblock <position: x y z> <tileName: Block> [destroy|keep|replace]
## Arguments
JE: <pos>: block_posBE: position: x y z: CommandPosition

Specifies the position of the block to be changed.
InJava Edition, must be ablock positioncomposed of<X>,<Y>and<Z>, each of which must be an integer or atilde and caret notation. InBedrock Edition, must be a three-dimensional coordinates composed of<X>,<Y>and<Z>, each of which must be asingle-precision floating-point numberortilde and caret notation.
JE: <block>: block_stateBE: tileName: Block: enum

Specifies the new block.
InJava Edition, must be in the format ofblock_id[block_states]{data_tags}(does not accept block tags), in which block states and data tags can be omitted when they are not needed. InBedrock Edition, must be ablock id.
BE: blockStates: block states: BlockStateCommandParam

Specifies theblock statesto use for the block.
Must be a blockstate argument as["<state1>"=<value1>,"<state2>"=<value2>,...]. For example:["old_leaf_type"="birch","persistent_bit"=true].
destroy|keep|replace

Specifies how to handle the block change. Must be one of:
- destroy— The old blockdropsboth itself and its contents (as if destroyed by aplayer). Plays the appropriate block breaking noise.
- keep— Onlyairblocks are changed (non-air blocks are unchanged).
- replace— The old block drops neither itself nor any contents. Plays no sound.

If not specified, defaults toreplace.
