### Slowing down entities
Honey blocks slow down entities walking on top of them and prevent them from jumping. Players walking on honey blocks move 2.508 m/s, about a 60% reduction from the normal walking speed. In Bedrock Edition, players also slow down slightly if walking up against the side of it. Players, who can ordinarily jump about 1 1⁄4 blocks high, can jump about 3⁄16 blocks high on honey; this is an 85% reduction. They can more easily step up onto other blocks than jump up onto them.

This effect applies even through other blocks on top of honey blocks as long as they are half-block or less in height - so the player cannot jump on carpets, bottom slabs or daylight detectors that are placed on honey blocks.

This effect also applies regardless of a player's mode of movement, such as flying with elytra or swimming.

### Sliding
Entities pressed against the sides of a honey block slide down at a slow speed and do not take fall damage, similar to going down a ladder but with a gradually decreasing horizontal momentum.‌[Java Edition  only] This allows players to jump 2 blocks further by holding on to the walls. The slowdown induced by honey blocks also stacks with the Slow Falling status effect.

### Falling
As with hay bales, falling onto a honey block reduces fall damage by 80%. For example, if a player or mob falls from a height that would normally cause 10 fall damage, the fall causes 2 damage instead.

### Bees
When a honey block is near bees and a beehive or bee nest, bees occasionally fly close and attach to it for a few seconds, resembling an action of eating honey. When doing this, the bee stops fluttering its wings, and firmly attaches its face to the honey block regardless of whether flowers are nearby.

### Crafting ingredient
Although the 2×2 inventory crafting grid is sufficient to craft a honey block, a 3×3 crafting table grid is required to convert a honey block back into four honey bottles.
