## Java Edition
These resources are not renewable in Java Edition, even though they are in the Bedrock Edition.

| Netherrack<br/><br/> | <br/>(Any armor with rib trim) | Whennether portalsgenerate in the air, they do not create netherrack like they do inBedrock Edition.Rib armor trim smithing template can be found in nether fortress chests, netherite upgrade smithing template can be found in bastion remnant chests, one template of the same type is required to craft duplicates using netherrack and diamonds. Items that need diamonds or netherite to craft remain non-renewable on Bedrock edition, despite the renewability of netherrack. |

However, inBedrock Edition, they can be obtained using a tool withSilk Touch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Peaceful difficulty
These resources are not renewable while playing in Peaceful difficulty as their renewable methods of obtaining require the spawning of hostile mobs. (Previously mentioned non-renewable resources are removed from the products list).

In Bedrock Edition, piglins still spawn in Peaceful difficulty. By killing piglins, the player can sometimes obtain golden swords, then smelt them into gold nuggets. This makes gold renewable, along with all items obtainable via bartering.

Going to the End almost always requires the use of eyes of ender, which are unobtainable in Peaceful difficulty, to activate the end portal, with the chances of requiring none being only 1 in a trillion for each end portal. Therefore, resources exclusive to the End can also be considered unobtainable and therefore non-renewable in Peaceful difficulty.
