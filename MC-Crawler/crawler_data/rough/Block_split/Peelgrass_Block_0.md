## Obtaining
### Breaking
A peelgrass block can be broken using anything, but a shovel is the fastest. Peelgrass blocks drop terre de pomme when mined unless Silk Touch is used.

### Natural generation
Peelgrass blocks naturally generate throughout the surface of the Potato dimension as the ground of arboretum and fields biomes.

### Post-generation
Peelgrass can spread to nearby terre de pomme blocks, just like grass spreads to dirt. Additionally, using lime potato peels on terre de pomme turns it to peelgrass.

## Usage
### Farming
Using a hoe on a peelgrass block turns it into poison farmland. Potatoes can grow on peelgrass blocks without the need of tilling them.

### Paths
Using a shovel on a peelgrass block turns it into a poison path.

### Peeling
Using a potato peeler on a peelgrass block turns it into terre de pomme, and drops lime potato peels.
