## Notes
1. ↑TIGSource forums use UTC-8.
2. ↑Note the region marked with green in gallery image "Proof_not_brown_spider_1.png". When turned 45 degrees counter-clockwise, this marked region is exactly what is shown as the background of the error screenshot that is often claimed to show the texture of a brown spider.  It is merely a close-up of diagonally adjacent dirt blocks.
