## Natural resources and altitude
Features in the landscape of the Overworld are found at different altitudes, as shown in the graph below for Java Edition 1.20.2.



Note that these charts utilize the logarithmic scale, which means a slight difference in the Y-coordinate represents a large change in the relative frequency of a block type. Also note that normal and deepslate ore variants have been combined in the chart. Interactive versions of these graphs containing all blocks can be found here.
