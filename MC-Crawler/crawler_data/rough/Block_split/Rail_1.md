#### Piston interactivity
Rails can be pushed and pulled by pistons. Pushing a rail upward may cause adjacent rails to become slanted. Subsequently pulling the rail back down again causes those newly-slanted rails to break because they are no longer supported on their upper end.

### Redstone component
The intersection rail at a T-intersection may be made to change its direction of curvature by applying redstone power using a redstone torch, lever, or button.

Separate tracks are laid adjacent, but at the next level, lower or higher can sometimes cause issues. However, normally they do not interact with the switched rail.

### Minecart behavior
#### South-east rule


Main article: South-east rule
A minecart travels straight through a T-shaped intersection when entering from the "back of" the curved rail. It follows the curve when entering from either of the other two legs.

A minecart passes straight through a 4-way intersection constructed to have no curved rail. When entering the 4-way from east or west a cart turns according to the south-east rule.


#### Downhill rule

At non-curve track intersections, minecarts always travel downhill if they can. This is known as the downhill rule and overrides the south-east rule.


#### 

A block placed above the track at the downhill end of a ramp prevents minecarts from traveling down the slope, but not up. For a minecart to move down a diagonal tunnel, there must be clearance sufficient for a player to walk it.


#### Curve intersections
A diagram on how minecarts travel according to track curves.
If a straight track piece leads to a curve block and isn't attached to the curve, a minecart runs over the gap and continues to go straight over the curve. This is not applicable to other types of rails.

Notably, the minecart can exceed the normal 8 m/s speed limit while it jumps over the gap. For example, by placing intersections on every other block of a straight track, it is possible to travel (uncomfortably) at 10 m/s in a straight direction.

As with straight T-intersections and 4-way intersections, the practice of making a minecart jump track can be used to make one-way entries onto a track. On curve intersections the behavior is more intuitive because the cart simply proceeds in the direction it is already going, allowing designs that don't rely on the south-east rule.


#### Rail performance
To ascend from 0 to max speed, most minecarts needs 7 powered rails (a minecart with furnace has a lower top speed). After a certain number of rails, a minecart begins slowing down. This slowdown can be negated with a powered rail. A certain number of rails followed by 1 powered rail can then be repeated indefinitely to maintain full speed with the minimum amount of powered rails.

| Minecart type                              | Initial maximum rails at full speed | Subsequent maximums          |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Emptyminecartandminecart with TNT          | 7                                   | 3                            |
| Minecart with entity                       | 112                                 | Alternates between 38 and 26 |
| Minecart with chestandminecart with hopper | 85                                  | 20, then 29 onward           |

For example, a minecart with an entity would require 112 rails, then 1 powered rail, then 38 rails, then 1 powered rail, then 26 rails, then 1 powered rail, then 38 rails, etc. Note that these rails can go in any direction: going 112 rails diagonally would still require a powered rail.

A minecart with no rider at full speed can climb 10 blocks on an unpowered track. This suggests that a powered track is needed at a height of only 10 blocks to keep a cart climbing. However, the cart slows so much that it can reach only another 5 blocks high with 2 lengths of powered track starting at 9 blocks high. The minimum number of powered rails to keep the cart climbing perpetually is 3 every 6 blocks.

Carts with a rider, or minecarts with chests, have more momentum and so climb higher than carts that are unloaded. With a rider, a minecart can climb at least 24 blocks before needing powered rails to go higher.

### Mob behavior

  

This feature is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


In Java Edition, most mobs avoid walking on rails,[1] but they ignore rails when they are already on them. Jumping mobs like slimes, frogs[2], and goats can jump onto rails, but frogs and goats do not walk onto rails. Aquatic creatures like guardians, tadpoles, and fish that flop around on land can flop onto rails. Parrots can land on rails and endermen can teleport onto rails, although they do not walk onto them. In pursuit of their targets, zombies may push other mobs onto the rails in which case the mob on the rail ignores rails while on them. The only mobs that freely walk onto rails are spiders, cave spiders, and wardens.

In Bedrock Edition, rails don't affect mob pathfinding in any way.
