## Obtaining
### Breaking
A conduit drops as an item when broken with any tool or by hand, but a pickaxe is the fastest way to break it.

Like other precious blocks such as beacons and shulker boxes, when destroyed by an explosion, a conduit always drops as an item.

Schematic of a conduit in an activation frame. Click the scale on the right to view the layers.The conduit and water are required. The frame must include 16-42 blocks of prismarine, dark prismarine, sea lanterns, and/or prismarine bricks. Unused frame-blocks and empty spaces can be anything.


When activated, conduits give the "Conduit Power" effect to all players in contact with rain or water, within a spherical range of 32-96 blocks. This effect restores oxygen, gives underwater night vision and increases mining speed by 16.7% (1/6th). Conduits also damage any hostile mobs, like drowned, guardians, and elder guardians, within a range of 8 blocks of the conduit. Conduits can be activated in any biome and at any height or depth.

To activate, a conduit needs to be in the center of a 3×3×3 volume of water (source blocks, flowing water, and/or waterlogged blocks), which itself must be enclosed within an activation frame. The frame is built out of blocks in three 5×5 open squares centered on the conduit, one around each axis. Only prismarine, dark prismarine, prismarine bricks, and sea lantern blocks in the frame contribute to activation. A minimum of 16 blocks are required and produce an effective range of 32 blocks. Prismarine-type slabs (including double slabs), stairs, and walls cannot be used to activate the conduit. Any blocks (of any type) that are not part of the activation frame itself but are in the 5×5×5 outer shell likewise have no effect. Once activated, removing any blocks away from the conduit (frame blocks) deactivates the conduit.[note 1]

The effective radius of the conduit is 16 blocks for every seven blocks in the frame, though the effect does not activate until the minimum of 16 blocks is included in the build. Thus, it extends to 48 at 21 blocks, 64 at 28 blocks, 80 at 35 blocks, and 96 with a complete frame of 42 blocks. When the frame is complete, the center of the conduit displays an orange iris-like shape. A complete frame also carries the additional advantage of attacking hostile mobs within 8 blocks of the conduit by 4 every 2 seconds, if they are in contact with water or rain.[note 2]
