# Piston
A piston is a block capable of pushing most entities and blocks when given a redstone signal. 

Some blocks cannot be moved, break when pushed or have other interactions with pistons. A piston can move up to twelve blocks at once.

## Obtaining
### Breaking
A piston can be broken using any tool with equal efficiency, and always drops itself.
In Java Edition, it is faster to break them with a pickaxe. The pickaxe is also the preferred tool for breaking the head when extended.[1]

1. ↑Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

### Redstone component
Pistons are always placed facing toward the player. When powered, the piston's wooden surface (the "head") tries to start extending after start delay. When it extends, it pushes at most 12 blocks. The piston makes a sound that can be heard within a 31×31×31 cube centered on the activating piston. Any entities in the path of the extending head are pushed with the blocks. If there is no place for the entities to go, the block pushes inside them, suffocating mobs if the block is not transparent when pushed into the eye height of the mob.

When a piston loses power, its head retracts. Like extending, this retraction starts after start delay. It finishes retracting 2 game ticks (1 redstone tick; 0.1 seconds) after it starts. 

A piston that pushes a slime block bounces any entity that it displaces in the direction the piston is facing. In addition, when a slime block is moved by a piston, any movable blocks adjacent (not diagonally) to the slime block also moves. See the #Slime blocks and honey blocks section below for more details.

In Bedrock Edition, blocks that stick to walls (such as levers) can be placed on pistons without being destroyed when activated.

#### Start delay
A piston won't extend or retract immediately when it is activated: this is called start delay.

In Bedrock Edition, the start delay is fixed at 2 game ticks (1 redstone tick; 0.1 seconds), meaning that the piston starts to extend or retract 2gt after it's activated.

In Java Edition, the start delay can be 0 game ticks (0 redstone ticks; 0 seconds) (start at the same tick) or 1 game tick (0.5 redstone ticks; 0.05 seconds) (start at the next tick) depending on the game process when the piston is activated:

- If the piston is updated and activated in thescheduled tickstage,random tickstage or block event stage, the piston stage is executed in this game tick's block event stage. At this time, the start delay is 0gt, which means the piston starts at the same tick.
- If the piston is activated during the execution of entity or tile entity, or activated by player actions, the piston stage is executed in the next game tick's block event stage. At this time, the start delay is 1gt, which means the piston starts at the next tick.

### Limitations
Pistons can push most blocks except those listed in the table below. 

Pistons cannot push blocks into the void or beyond the top of the map. They also cannot push more than 12 blocks. If the requirements for a block to be pushed are not met, the piston simply does not extend.
