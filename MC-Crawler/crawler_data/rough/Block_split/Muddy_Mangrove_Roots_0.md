## Obtaining
### Breaking
Muddy mangrove roots can be broken by hand, but using a shovel speeds up the process. Muddy mangrove roots drop themselves when broken with any tool.

### Natural generation
Muddy mangrove roots naturally generate in mangrove swamps where mud blocks intersect with normal mangrove roots at the bottom of mangrove trees.

### Post-generation
When a mangrove propagule grows into a tree, if the tree roots intersect with nearby mud blocks, those mud blocks are converted into muddy mangrove roots.

## Usage
Muddy mangrove roots are primarily used as decoration. They are orientable and can be rotated on any axis, facing perpendicular to whichever side of a block they are placed on.

### Farming
Muddy mangrove roots have the ability to grow saplings, sugar cane, sweet berries, and bamboo, which can be planted directly on them under appropriate conditions. Saplings convert muddy mangrove roots into dirt when grown,‌[Bedrock Edition  only] and azalea trees grown on muddy mangrove roots convert them into rooted dirt.
