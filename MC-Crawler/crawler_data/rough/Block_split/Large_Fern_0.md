## Obtaining
### Breaking
When broken normally, a large fern has a 12.5% chance of dropping 1 wheat seeds item. This is affected by the Fortune enchantment, dropping 1–3, 1–5, or 1–7 wheat seeds with Fortune I, II, and III respectively.

When broken using shears, a large fern drops two ferns instead. The large fern item exists, and is available in Creative mode, but cannot be obtained by breaking it in Survival, since it drops small ferns instead of dropping itself.

Placing any block on a large fern breaks the fern and causes it to not drop any wheat seeds.

| Block    | Large Fern          |

| Hardness | 0                   |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.05                |

### Natural generation
Large ferns generate occur naturally only in taiga, snowy taiga and old growth taiga biomes.

Large ferns can additionally be found around some taiga and snowy taiga‌[BE  only] village houses.

### Post-generation
Bone meal can be used on a fern to grow it into a large fern.

## Usage
Most 2-block tall plants, including large ferns, have a disproportionately large hitbox compared to other plants.[1] The only exception to this rule is tall seagrass.[2]

### Composting
Placing a large fern into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
