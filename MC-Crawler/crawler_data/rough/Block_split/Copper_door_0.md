## Obtaining
### Breaking
Copper doors can be mined only with a stone pickaxe or better. If a copper door is mined without the use of a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

## Usage
Main article: Door § Usage
Copper doors can be opened and closed using a redstone signal, or by players, villagers[1], piglins, wandering traders‌[BE  only], vindicators‌[JE  only]. Copper doors are also affected by the wind burst of thrown wind charges, causing them to open if closed, or vice versa.

In Hard difficulty, copper doors can be broken by vindicators and all variants of zombies except drowned.[2]

### Barrier
A copper door can be opened or closed by pressing the Use Item/Place Block control. When a door opens or closes, it immediately changes its orientation without affecting anything in the space it "swings through".

Some zombies can break copper doors in Hard difficulty. Zombies have a 5% chance to spawn with the ability to break doors. Vindicators spawned from a raid in Normal and Hard difficulty can also break copper doors, but they do so only to reach targeted players, villagers, or wandering traders. In Java Edition, some vindicators may sometimes open a copper door instead of breaking it. Both zombies and vindicators attempt to break a copper door only when the door is in its "closed" state; this is the case even when the door is placed in such a way as to allow passage in its "closed" state and block passage in its "open" state (for example, by facing sideways when placing the door).

### Redstone component
See also: Redstone circuit

Copper doors can be controlled with redstone power.

A copper door is a redstone mechanism component and can be activated by  weakly powering any cardinally adjacent block.

When activated, the copper door immediately opens. When deactivated, it immediately closes. Players and mobs can still open and close a door that is controlled by a redstone signal.

All methods of activating a door can be applied to either the top or bottom parts of a door.
