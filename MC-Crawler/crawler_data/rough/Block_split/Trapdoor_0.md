### Properties
Wooden and copper trapdoors can be opened and closed by players or redstone pulse. Iron trapdoors can be opened only by redstone pulse. Trapdoors can be opened or closed with a player or mob inside.[1]

To place a trapdoor, use a trapdoor item while pointing at the block it should be attached to. Once it is placed, the attachment block can be removed without breaking the trapdoor.

When placed, a trapdoor either occupies the top or bottom part of a block, depending on where the player placed the trapdoor. If a trapdoor is placed on the top part of a block, it opens downward. If placed on the bottom part of a block, it opens upward. A trapdoor's "hinge" is located on the block attached to it.

Closed trapdoors acting as solid surfaces for lanterns
Trapdoors can act as a solid block when in the closed position, and thus certain items can be placed above or below it (depending on whether the closed trapdoor occupies the top half or bottom half of a block). When trapdoors are opened, they act like a non-solid block resulting as a non-placeable area. Lanterns, for example, can be placed on top of a closed trapdoor that occupies the top half of a block, and below a closed trapdoor that occupies the bottom half of a block.

Trapdoors can be moved by pistons. Trapdoors block flowing water and lava. Waterlogged trapdoors release water from all sides apart from the top in Bedrock Edition, or all sides apart from the side that is blocked by the trapdoor itself (and the top) in Java Edition.

Closing a trapdoor one block above the ground while standing under it causes the player to crawl, and continue crawling until reaching an area with at least 1.5 empty blocks above, at which time the player stands automatically. This can be used to enter small secret tunnels or otherwise inaccessible terrain.

A player climbing an open trapdoor placed above a ladder
In Java Edition, single trapdoors are climbable if they are open and placed directly above a ladder on the same side of a wall. This means if an open trapdoor is placed in the middle of two ladders, players can climb through the trapdoor directly as if it were another ladder. However, if there is more than one trapdoor between two ladders, players cannot climb through (they are stopped at the top of the first trapdoor).

The sound of opening and closing of a trapdoor can be heard up to 16 blocks away, like most mob sounds.

### Barrier
A trapdoor can be used as a switchable barrier to entity movement. Although primarily used to block movement by mobs and players, a trapdoor can also be used to control the movement of boats (for example, a top trapdoor placed in a two-wide water flow stops a boat when closed (extended out into the water flow), but allow it to move again when open), items and minecarts (a trapdoor can stop a falling item or minecart, then allow it to drop again when the trapdoor opens), etc.

Trapdoors are 0.1875 (3⁄16) blocks thick. The rest of a trapdoor's space can be moved through freely and provides a breathable space if placed underwater and not waterlogged.

When a trapdoor opens or closes, it immediately changes its orientation without affecting anything in the space it "passes through". Moving trapdoors don't push entities the way that pistons do.

Mobs consider all trapdoors closed, resulting in pathfinding mobs falling through open trapdoors.[2] A player can take advantage of this behavior to construct mob traps.
