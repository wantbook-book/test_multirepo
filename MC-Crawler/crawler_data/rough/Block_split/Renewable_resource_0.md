# Renewable resource
A renewable resource (as opposed to a non-renewable resource, or finite resource) is a resource that can be recreated indefinitely in Survival without exploiting glitches or using cheat commands. While running completely out of resources is unlikely to be a factor in normal worlds due to the massive size of a Minecraft map, only some resources can be produced over and over without having to explore more terrain. Running out of resources can be a bigger issue on Superflat worlds, where resources are less plentiful, in PvP maps, where one would like to obtain resources without having to conquer more land, or simply if the accessible portion of the map is limited.

The listed fully renewable craftable items are items that can be crafted, smelted, or brewed using only renewable resources. For example, cookies are renewable as they require only wheat and cocoa beans, both of which can be regrown infinitely.

Most items dropped by animals or monsters are renewable because more mobs of the same kind can spawn and be killed again for more loot. The exceptions are drops of enemies that spawn just once with the generation of specific structures, such as elder guardians (three spawn with each ocean monument). Drops of hostile mobs, with the exception of those obtainable by other means, are not renewable on Peaceful difficulty because the monsters do not spawn.

## Methods for renewably obtaining
Many resources are renewably obtainable using certain main methods, such as farming. Others are obtainable by unusual item-specific methods, which can vary from building a cobblestone generator to harvesting obsidian from portals to collecting dragon breath into a glass bottle. The renewable method to obtain an item is not necessarily the easiest, fastest or safest, and may in some cases be highly impractical.

The most common methods for renewably obtaining items, ordered roughly by increasing effort are:

- Farmingand plant growth - grow it on thedirtorfarmlandetc using renewable resources;
- Breedingand harvesting certainmobs;
- Crafting,smelting,brewingetc. using only renewable resource(s);
- Common drops from killingmobs;
- Fishing;
- Tradingwithvillagers;
- Trading withwandering traders;
- Barteringwithpiglins;
- Rare mob drops;
- Receiving giftsfrom villagers after defeating araid;
- Receiving gifts fromcats;
- Constructingitem and mob farmsfor resource drops;
- Taking advantage of various other mechanics that generate or convert blocks and items, such ascobblestone generation, freezingice, and filling uplava cauldrons.

The first three methods are often the most practical ways to obtain items that can be obtained by using them.

Most items obtainable by fishing and trading are obtainable in some other way, which may be easier or of comparable difficulty, but may not be renewable. They are especially worth using when the player wants to avoid the risk of mining, such as while playing in Hardcore mode.

Grinding for rare drops is rarely practical unless there is no other option, as the player must kill many mobs to obtain the desired drops.
