## Spawning
Nerd creepers spawn when the player uses the cheat code "NEEEERD".

Creepers in this version have an NBT tag called Â d20 (1 = true/0 = false) that determines whether the creeper is a nerd.

A nerd creeper can be summoned with the following command: /summon creeper ~ ~ ~ {d20:1}

## Drops
When killed, nerd creepers drop: 

- 5experiencepoints, if killed by theplayeror a tamedwolf.
- 13Ditem.
- 1music discat random, if killed by askeletonorstray.
- 1creeper head, if killed by acharged creeper.

## Behavior
Nerd creepers, effectively being a reskinned creeper, shared almost all of their behavior, except when killed, they dropped the 3D item instead of gunpowder.
