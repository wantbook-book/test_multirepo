#### Highland biomes
Highland biomes are biomes with higher Y-level, rugged terrain and snow-covered peaks appear above the snow line.

These biomes are further divided into two categories: mountains and windswept hills.

| Jagged Peaks             | One of the three biomes that generate in the peaks of a mountain. This biome is found in taller and more jagged and pointy peaks that often pass the clouds and can peak at y=256. It is covered by a single layer of snow blocks with stone underneath often exposing ores such as coal, iron and emerald, and just like the snowy slopes, stone cliffs can generate in some sides of the mountain. Only goats spawn in this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Jagged peaks             |
| Frozen Peaks             | The frozen peaks are covered by snow blocks and packed ice with occasional small blobs of ice. Only goats can spawn in this biome. This biome usually generates in smoother and less jagged mountains compared to the jagged peaks biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Frozen peaks             |
| Stony Peaks              | The stony peaks are a warmer variation of peak biomes that generates in warmer regions to avoid temperature clashes. It is mainly covered by stone with large strips of calcite and exposed ores. No passive mobs spawn here and there's no snow in this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Stony peaks              |
| Meadow                   | The meadow is an elevated grassy biome found in plateaus near mountain ranges. It is filled with patches of flowers and turquoise-green short grass and tall grass. All small flowers generate except blue orchids, tulips, lilies of the valley or wither roses. Rarely, a lone oak or birch tree can generate and always has a bee nest. Both pillager outposts and plains villages can generate in this biome. Sheep, donkeys and rabbits are the only passive mobs that spawn in this biome.                                                                                                                                                                              | Meadows                  |
| Cherry Grove             | Cherry groves are grasslands with a lot of short grass, tall grass and, besides the traditional dandelions and poppies flowers, there are pink petals. The main environmental feature of the cherry grove are cherry trees identified by their striking pink color. Their leaves drop petal particles. The cherry trees may generate densely enough create a cover of leaves. The cherry grove biome is good for surviving. The sparseness of trees can help the player not to get lost while collecting a great abundance of resources.                                                                                                                                      | Cherry blossom grove     |
| Grove                    | The grove creates a forest of spruce trees beneath the mountain peaks when near a forested biome. It is quite reminiscent of the snowy taiga but the surface is covered with snow layers, snow blocks, dirt and a lot of powder snow instead of grass blocks. Rabbits, wolves and foxes can spawn in this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Grove                    |
| Snowy Slopes             | The snowy slopes generate on beneath the mountain peaks and are covered multiple layers of snow blocks and powder snow, with some sides also having stone cliffs. Goats spawn in this biome alongside rabbits. This is the only mountain biome where igloos can generate, making it one of the three biomes where igloos naturally generate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Snowy slopes             |
| Windswept Hills          | A highland biome with some steep hilltops. Cliffs, peaks, valleys, waterfalls, overhangs, floating islands, caverns and many other terrain features exist here, offering outstanding views. This is one of the few biomes where llamas can spawn naturally. Snowfall also occurs above certain heights up the mountain, thus creating snow layers on the top of the hills. Falling is a significant risk, as there are many steep ledges large enough to cause severe fall damage or even death. Windswept hills are one of a few biomes where emerald ore and infested stone can be found naturally. In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, trees cannot generate here. | Windswept hills          |
| Windswept Gravelly Hills | The windswept gravelly hills are mostly covered in gravel with occasional patches of grass and stone blocks. This makes it one of the best places to mine gravel due to the sheer quantity of it. Due to the low amount of grass, the population of spruce and oak trees in this biome is sparse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Windswept gravelly hills |
| Windswept Forest         | This biome is found when the windswept hills are located next to forested biomes. It doesn't generate stone patches so the floor is entirely covered by grass, and there are more spruce and oak trees in this biome, forming small forests with a lower tree density than the taiga biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Windswept forest         |

#### Woodland biomes
Woodland biomes are rich in plants, with trees, flowers and grasses constituting the flora on the surface. It is one of the ideal birthplaces where plenty of wood resources are available, but the dense vegetation makes it dangerous to move around the forest at night because the trees block the view, this is also true in the day time since the trees block the sunlight and mobs can spawn.

These biomes are further divided into 7 categories: forests, taiga, old growth taigas, snowy taiga, birch forests, dark forest and jungles.

| Biome name              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Screenshot              |

| Forest                  | A common biome with many oak and birch trees and a fair amount of short grass, mushrooms and flowers. This is one of the most preferred biomes to start out in, due to the abundance of wood. Like in taigas, wolves are found.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Forest                  |
| Flower Forest           | This forest variant has fewer trees, but more than makes up for it - it is almost overflowing with nearly every type of flower and tall plant in the game. Therefore, this biome is optimal for harvesting and farming dyes. Wolves do not spawn in the flower forest, although rabbits spawn occasionally. Bee nests have a higher spawn rate in this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Flower forest           |
| Taiga                   | A biome covered by a forest of spruce trees. Ferns, large ferns and sweet berry bushes grow commonly on the forest floor. One can find packs of wolves here, along with small groups of foxes or rabbits. Villages may generate in this biome; the houses in these villages are built of spruce wood. Pillager outposts may also generate in this biome. This is one of the few biomes where trail ruins can generate, along with its old growth and snowy variants.                                                                                                                                                    | Taiga                   |
| Old Growth Pine Taiga   | A biome composed of spruce trees (despite it being called a pine taiga, since there is no pine in the game), much like the standard taiga biome. However, some trees are 2×2 thick and taller than normal, akin to large jungle trees. Mossy cobblestone boulders appear frequently, mushrooms are common, and podzol can be found on the forest floor. There are also patches of coarse dirt that do not grow grass, with some dead bushes. Wolves and foxes may also spawn here, as they do in normal taiga biomes. Rabbits may also spawn here‌[JE  only].                                                           | Old growth pine taiga   |
| Old Growth Spruce Taiga | At first glance, this biome may look almost exactly the same as its pine tree counterpart. However, the most striking feature of this biome is its giant spruce trees, which are essentially a scaled-up version of regular spruce trees. One can easily differentiate this from an old growth pine taiga by observing how the leaves almost completely cover the tree trunks, whereas in pine ones, leaves tend to cover only the top.                                                                                                                                                                                 | Old growth spruce taiga |
| Snowy Taiga             | Much like the regular taiga, the snowy taiga has large expanses of spruce trees. Ferns and their taller variants generate here commonly, although short grass can still be found. It is one of the few places where wolves and foxes spawn naturally. One may also find an igloo nestled between the trees from a more or less flat terrain, making it one of the three biomes where igloos naturally generate. Villages‌[BE  only] and pillager outposts‌[BE  only] may also generate here. Villages use the same architecture as taiga villages but the villagers wear snowy biome outfits.                           | Snowy taiga             |
| Birch Forest            | A forest where the grass is aqua and only birch trees generate. Unlike in the regular forest, no wolves spawn in this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Birch forest            |
| Old Growth Birch Forest | Birch trees grow much taller than usual in this uncommon variant of the birch forest biome. Whereas normal birch trees grow up to 7 blocks tall, these trees usually are 11 blocks in height. This makes deforestation a much more difficult task, although it provides the player with far more resources. Trail ruins also generate here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Old growth birch forest |
| Dark Forest             | This biome is mainly composed of dark oak trees, a mostly closed roof of leaves, and occasional huge mushrooms. Trees in this forest are so densely packed together that it's dark enough for hostile mobs to spawn, even during the day. On rare occasions, a woodland mansion may spawn, making the dark forest the only biome in which that structure can be found.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Dark forest             |
| Jungle                  | A dense forested biome. It features ferns and large jungle trees that can reach up to 31 blocks tall with 2×2 thick trunks. Oak trees are also common though. The landscape is lush green, leaves cover much of the forest floor—these "bush trees" have single-blocks of jungle wood for trunks, surrounded by oak or jungle leaves. Vines are found alongside most blocks and may cover the surface of caves. Ocelots, jungle pyramids, trail ruins, melons, cocoa beans, pandas and parrots spawn in this biome. Melons generate in patches, similar to pumpkins, but are common.                                    | Jungle                  |
| Sparse Jungle           | In stark contrast to the wild and overgrown vegetation of the jungle biomes, the sparse jungle consists of a few small and isolated jungle trees, with patches of melons here and there. The terrain in which this biome can generate is often flat, with some small rises in elevation. All mobs that spawn in the jungle, including parrots, ocelots, pandas‌[Bedrock Edition  only] also spawn in the sparse jungle. ‌In Java Edition 1.20.5 and Bedrock Edition 1.20.80‌[upcoming], wolves can also spawn in this biome.                                                                                            | Sparse jungle           |
| Bamboo Jungle           | The terrain in this biome is covered by grass with some patches of podzol. Unlike the normal jungle, bushes still generate but do not cover the floor. Additionally, large jungle trees that are 2×2 instead of the normal 1×1 can generate here, along with large or balloon oak trees. The density of trees in this biome is much less compared to sparse jungle, but massive amounts of bamboo shoots generate covering this biome. Jungle exclusive mobs such as ocelots and parrots can spawn in here, pandas have an even higher spawn rate than in regular jungle. Jungle pyramids can also generate‌[JE  only]. | Bamboo jungle           |
