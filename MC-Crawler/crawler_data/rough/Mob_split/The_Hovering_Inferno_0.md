## Behavior
Wildfires are shielded mobs similar to royal guards, vanguards, and tower guards, where the mob's shield must be destroyed first. However, unlike most shielded mobs, wildfires have four shields protecting them, all of which must be destroyed before the hero can inflict damage, and the shields can also take multiple hits before breaking. When wildfires are low on health, they will retreat and heal itself within fire like blazes, but can also regenerate damaged and destroyed shields.

** Basic attack **
Wildfires will occasionally shoot a barrage of shield debris instead of fireballs at a hero.

** Shockwave attack **
Wildfires will slam the ground if a target gets too close, sending out a small shockwave, knocking back both heroes and mobs.

** Summon **
Wildfires are also capable of summoning one or two blazes to assist it.
