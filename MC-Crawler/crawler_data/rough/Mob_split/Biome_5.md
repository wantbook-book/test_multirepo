| Legacy Frozen Ocean              | Polar bears, salmon, cod, strays, cold underwater ruins, gravel, seagrass, kelp, snowy rabbits, ice, shipwrecks                       | Similar to thefrozen oceanbiome, but without icebergs, it is completely flat. Because they are a frozen ocean variant, they can spawn polar bears and strays, but not dolphins. Unlike the regular frozen ocean, polar bears, drowned, squid, salmon, cod, rabbits, skeletons and strays are the only mobs that spawn here. Kelp also generates here. This biome doesn't generate naturally fromPocket Edition Alpha 0.9.0onward. WhenBedrock Edition 1.4.0introduced the new frozen ocean, this biome was not removed or replaced by the new frozen ocean, although the id name changed from`frozen_ocean`to`legacy_frozen_ocean`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Legacy frozen ocean                                           |
| Desert Lakes                     | Sand, cacti, water, sugar canes, gold rabbits, desert well, fossils, husks                                                            | In this biome, patches of water are more common, and the terrain is slightly more rough. Although desert wells can be found, desert pyramids, villages and outposts do not generate in this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Desert lakes                                                  |
| Mountain Edge                    | Grass blocks, dirt, stone, llamas, emerald ore, infested stone, spruce trees, oak trees, snow                                         | Similar to thesparse junglebiome, the mountain edge used to generate exclusively at the edge of windswept hills biomes in order to smooth the transition between biomes. This biome has lots of trees, similar to windswept forests. While the terrain is lower and gentler in nature, some areas may reach high enough to be covered by snow. This biome doesn't generate naturally fromPocket Edition v0.9.0 alphaandJava Edition 1.7.2onward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Mountain edge                                                 |
| Deep Warm Ocean                  | Dolphins, pufferfish, tropical fishes, warm underwater ruins, sand, seagrass, ocean monuments, guardians, elder guardians, shipwrecks | Similar to thewarm oceanbiome, but without coral reefs or sea pickles, and twice as deep. Because they are a deep ocean variant, they can generate ocean monuments, resulting in the spawning of guardians, elder guardians,prismarineandsponges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Deep warm ocean                                               |
| Hills                            |                                                                                                                                       | Hills are generated within certain biomes (including some of their variants) and are referred in the F3 menu with "hills" added to their name (except snowy mountains).This includes: wooded hills, taiga hills, snowy taiga hills, jungle hills, desert hills, birch forest hills, tall birch hills, giant tree taiga hills, giant spruce taiga hills, snowy mountains and bamboo jungle hills.Most hills are gentle rolling slopes on which the usual biome terrain generates, with some sharper cliffs here and there. Snowy mountains have a lower chance of spawning passive mobs during world generation than other biomes (7% versus 10%).Giant spruce taiga hills are a special case. In Java Edition, the game code sets the values setBaseHeight and setHeightVariation to define a "hilly" biome, but uses the same values as for its non-hill variant (giant spruce taiga), meaning there is absolutely no terrain difference between the two biomes. In Bedrock Edition, this biome generates as a hillier version of the giant spruce taiga, but uses the same trees as the giant tree taiga hills (with leaves only at the top), resulting in the differences between these biomes being non-terrain aspects like water color and temperature. | Giant tree taiga hillsDesert hillsJungle hillsSnowy mountains |

They come to rest at an elevation of about 20 to 30 blocks above sea level. One may discover the entrance to a mineshaft within the tall slopes of a badlands plateau.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Badlands plateau                                              |

However, neither of these biomes closely resemble their counterparts.Compared to the average badlands plateau, the modified badlands plateau features more variable terrain and smaller plateaus, as if a larger plateau was weathered down over time. It is the second-rarest biome in the game, after the modified jungle edge.The terrain of the shattered savanna plateau biome is much less tame than its normal counterpart. It features incredibly large and steep mountains that jut out of the terrain, similar to the shattered savanna biome, albeit slightly smaller and gentler in comparison.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Modified badlands plateauShattered savanna plateau            |

However, the plateaus that generate here are generally smaller, allowing far less foliage to generate. The terrain is more erratic, and can be compared to that of the similar modified badlands plateau biome, having an old and eroded appearance. Eroded badlands generate instead of desert alongside this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Modified wooded badlands plateau                              |
| Mushroom Field Shore             | Mushrooms, huge mushrooms, mycelium, mooshrooms, buried treasure, shipwrecks                                                          | Mushroom field shores represent the transition between mushroom fields and the ocean, forming long strips between the biomes as a "beach", hence the name. However, it does not generate if the ocean biome is a deep ocean. This biome also generates when a river meets a mushroom fields biome, similar to what frozen rivers do in snowy plains. The terrain of this biome is much more flat and shallow than the main mushroom fields biome, though it contains many of the same features, such as a mycelium surface layer, huge mushrooms and lack of hostile mobs, but shipwrecks and buried treasure can generate here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Mushroom Field Shore                                          |

### Removed biomes
Main articles: Biome/Before Beta 1.8 and Biome/Before 1.18
These biomes no longer exist in current versions of the game.

| Tundra          | Snow, grass blocks, ice                                 | Snowy, barren terrain with few trees. The occasional trees do exist, although rarely. Ice can be found over water. Snow is common weather in tundras. It generates when the temperature is below 50% and the downfall is less than 20%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Tundra          |
| Rainforest      | Grass block, short grass, ferns, oak trees, birch trees | Rainforests are wet biomes with many trees, which have a 1 in 3 chance of being big, instead of 1 in 10 like all other biomes. They generate only oak trees and have a large amount of short grass and ferns. A biome is classified as a rainforest if the temperature is greater than 97% and the downfall is more than 90%. This could be the biome with some of the most cliffs and hills, because the world generator reduces height variation at lower downfalls. | Rainforest      |
| Seasonal Forest | Grass block, short grass, oak trees                     | Seasonal forests spawn with a temperature of 97% or greater, and a downfall value between 45% and 90%. They are commonly found between forest and rainforests, and near plains biomes. They are identical to forests, except they have fewer trees and can spawn only oak trees. They have a little bit of short grass.                                                                                                                                                | Seasonal forest |
| Ice Desert      | Sand, snow, ice                                         | An unused biome before Beta 1.8 that was in the code but never implemented into the temperature/downfall table and thus did not actually generate. It was a biome of sand with snow on top of it and had snowfall and ice (the player can create something similar using the buffet world option and choosing the snowy beach biome).                                                                                                                                  | Ice desert      |
| Shrubland       | Grass block, oak trees, birch trees                     | A biome with few trees and no short grass. It is identical to the savanna biome. It is one of the smallest biomes in the game. It can generate if the temperature is between 50% and 97%, and the downfall value is below 35%. It is too small to generate a forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Shrubland       |
