### Breaking
A bell can be mined by hand or with any tool, but using a pickaxe is fastest.

1. ↑Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.

### Natural generation
Bells can generate naturally in all village variants, usually near the center of the village in the meeting point.

### Trading
In Java Edition, apprentice-level armorer villagers have a 50% chance to sell a bell for 36 emeralds. Apprentice-level toolsmith and weaponsmith villagers always offer to sell a bell for 36 emeralds.

In Bedrock Edition, apprentice-level armorer villagers have a 1⁄3 chance to sell a bell for 36 emeralds. Apprentice-level toolsmith villagers sell bells for 36 emeralds. Journeyman-level weaponsmith villagers sell bells for 36 emeralds.

## Usage
Bells can be anchored to the side of blocks, ceilings, and floors and drop as an item if the sustain block is broken or moved by a piston. They can also be attatched to trapdoors but break if the trapdoor is opened.

When the use control is pressed while looking at the side of a bell, it produces a sound as well as a "swaying" animation. A bell can also be rung using a redstone signal, by any projectile, or by dropping an item on it.

If the player rings the bell while villagers are sleeping, all of the villagers wake up. Bells can be rung by players only from certain angles (villagers are not subject to this restriction); trying from an incorrect angle does not cause the bell to ring.

Villagers ring the bell only during raids.

### Claiming
A villager can detect a bell within 48 blocks euclidean distance horizontally and 6 block vertically (either up or down) from the base of his hitbox and can claim it if he gets within 6 blocks taxicab distance of it and there is a valid path that can lead them to be in the block right besides the bell. Baby villagers do not claim nor ring a bell.   

When villagers spawn (either naturally or by commands) and have not already claimed a bed or workstation will automatically claim any bell 6 blocks from them, even if they can't reach it. Also, when a bell is placed within 48 blocks from the pillow of a claimed bed and there is a valid path a villager can walk through, the bell gets automatically claimed in the afternoon (between 9000t and 12000t), which is displayed by green particles appearing above the bell. This does not work with claimed workstations.  

Claimed bells are POIs and determine the position of a village center among claimed beds and workstations.

When a player subject to the bad omen effect enters a village with a bell, the claiming mechanisms are forced no matter the time. So if the bell is close enough either from a villager or from a claimed bed it becomes part of the village.

A claimed bell defines a gathering site of a village and villagers pathfind close to it in the afternoon. If the bell is broken, anger particles appear above the village leader's head. 

If a player rings a bell, the villagers run to their houses even if there is no raid. They can activate a bell even through blocks but only if it was previously claimed and at least 2 blocks (also diagonal) from the base of their hitbox.
