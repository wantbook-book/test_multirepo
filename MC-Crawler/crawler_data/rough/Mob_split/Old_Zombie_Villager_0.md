## Spawning

When a group in the normal spawn cycle spawns zombies, there is a 5% chance to instead spawn a group of zombie villagers‌[Bedrock Edition  only], or a single zombie villager.‌[Java Edition  only]

If any type of zombie kills a villager, there is a chance for the villager to transform into a zombie villager.

| Difficulty | Chance |
|------------|--------|
| Easy       | 0%     |
| Normal     | 50%    |
| Hard       | 100%   |

In Java Edition a zombified zombie villager does not despawn if the player has traded with it at least once prior to its death, but unlike all other persistent mobs it still counts toward the hostile mob cap. If the zombie villager picks up any item however, it remains persistent but is excluded from the mob cap. In Bedrock Edition all zombified villagers are persistent.

A zombie villager appears alongside a cleric villager in every igloo basement (a normal zombie villager in Bedrock Edition and a cleric zombie villager in Java Edition). One of them transforms into a leatherworker, due to the workstation (a cauldron). They also generate as part of abandoned villages. Zombie villagers generated in both of these structures do not despawn naturally.

## Variants
### Baby zombies
All mobs that can be ridden by baby zombie villagers in Bedrock Edition.
Baby zombie villagers make up 5% of zombie villager spawns. They have big heads, unlike normal baby villagers in Java Edition. They behave similarly to regular zombie villagers, with the following differences:

- They are 30% faster than normalzombies, yet they have the samehealthas normal zombies. This makes baby zombie villagers more dangerous than their bigger counterparts.
- The noises they make are higher-pitched than adult zombie villagersoundeffects.
- InJava Edition, baby zombie villagers have a chance to spawn as achicken jockey.
- InBedrock Edition, 15% of naturally spawned baby zombie villagers can start riding a mob and become a jockey when it tries attacking avillager, player, orgolem. They can ride:

- Adultchickens
- Untamedocelots
- Untamedcats
- Untamedwolves
- Adultzombies
- Adulthusks
- Adultzombified villagers
- Adultzombified piglins
- Cows
- Adult unsaddledpigs
- Sheep
- Adult untamedhorses
- Adult untameddonkeys
- Adult untamedmules
- Adultskeleton horses
- Adultzombie horses
- Mooshrooms
- Spidersthat was not spawned as a jockey mount
- Cave spidersthat was not spawned as a jockey mount
- Pandas

Baby zombie villagers turn into baby villagers, if cured. In Java Edition, their heads turn back to small baby villager heads.[1]
Worn armor shrinks to fit their body size.
They are able to fit through 1×1 block gaps.
They drop 12 experience when killed by the player instead of 5.
Unlike other baby mobs but like undead baby mobs, they stay as babies indefinitely and never grow into "adult" zombie villagers.
They have a decreased hitbox size.
Baby zombie villagers are spawned when a zombie kills a baby villager, the chance of infection being the same as adult zombie villagers. Baby zombie villagers also spawn naturally, but the combined chance (5% villagers × 5% babies) is low at 0.25% (or 1 in 400 chance) of all newly spawned zombies.

### Armed zombie villagers
Along with skeletons and regular zombies, some zombie villagers are capable of picking up dropped items. These zombie villagers automatically pick up and hold any item that they come across (except jack o'lanterns‌[Java Edition  only], mob heads and pumpkins, as these are worn on their heads), and use any armor, weapons, or tools picked up. If they encounter another similar item, they pick it up and drop their previous item:

- if the newitemisarmoror a sword and the old item was not (for example, zombie villagers preferswordstopickaxesandhelmetstopumpkins),
- if both items are armor/swords and the new item is better damage-wise (reduces more damage for armor, or inflicts more damage for swords),
- if both items are armor/swords with the same damage reduction/infliction, the new item has NBT tags while the old does not or the new item ismoredamagedthan the old item, or
- if both items are bows and the new item has NBT tags while the old does not.

Items dropped by mobs in exchange for another cannot be picked up by players or mobs for 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag), but can be picked up by hoppers.

Armor worn by zombie villagers is not damaged from most damage sources, which means it cannot "wear out" the way player armor does. Helmets (not blocks like pumpkins) on zombie villagers can wear away and break if the zombie villager is exposed to daylight, or has an anvil or other falling block dropped on its head. Zombie villagers also have a natural armor rating of 2 (), which gives 1.6 - 8% damage reduction from most sources.

Some zombie villagers that are capable of picking up items spawn already in possession of such items, and those items may also be enchanted. The chances of that event are listed below. If a zombie villager spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (i.e. all pieces are made of the same material).

|                            | Easy | Normal         | Hard               |
|----------------------------|------|----------------|--------------------|
| Can Pick Up Loot           | 0%   | 0%-55%[note 1] | 6.875%-55%[note 1] |
| Armor                      | 0%   | 0%-15%[note 1] | 1.875%-15%[note 1] |
| Armor Enchantment[note 2]  | 0%   | 0-50%[note 1]  | 6.25%-50%[note 1]  |
| Weapon[note 3]             | 1%   | 1%             | 5%                 |
| Weapon Enchantment[note 2] | 0%   | 0%-25%[note 1] | 3.125%-25%[note 1] |

1. ↑ a b c d e f g h iValue is based on the regional difficulty.
2. ↑ a bEnchantment is the same as on an enchantment table at level 5–22.[note 1]
3. ↑1⁄3 chance of an iron sword, 2⁄3 chance of an iron shovel

If a zombie does spawn with armor, the chances of specific armor are as follows:

| Armor                          | Easy & Normal | Hard  |
|--------------------------------|---------------|-------|
| Helmet                         | 100%          | 100%  |
| Helmet & Chestplate            | 75%           | 90%   |
| Helmet & Chestplate & Leggings | 56.25%        | 81%   |
| Full set                       | 42.19%        | 72.9% |

The chances of it being of a particular material are:

| Armor Type | Chance |
|------------|--------|
| Leather    | 37.06% |
| Gold       | 48.73% |
| Chain      | 12.90% |
| Iron       | 1.27%  |
| Diamond    | 0.04%  |

Any zombie villager that spawns with equipment‌[Java Edition  only] (picked-up items don't count) drop 1–3 extra experience per item.
