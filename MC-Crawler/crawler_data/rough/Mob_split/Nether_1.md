## Environment
The Nether features unique cave-like terrain with no sky. Lava and fire are common hazards everywhere in the Nether. Areas distant from the player are shrouded in fog of red or blue. The shape of the terrain in the Nether is independent of the biome distribution; instead, the biome alters the surface material and adds terrain features to the netherrack terrain. 

### Biomes
Main article: Biome § The Nether
The Nether is divided into several biomes just like the Overworld, each featuring unique terrain, mobs, structures, ambience, etc. There are currently five biomes in the Nether.

| Biome name       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Image |

| Nether Wastes    | Initially the sole biome in the dimension before theNether Update, the nether wastes is the most common biome in the Nether. The surface is composed of uncoverednetherrack, exposing moreblobsthan any other biome.Zombified piglinsdominate this biome, and can be found in hordes of up to 4. Ghasts and Magma cubes also spawn, along with the occasional group ofPiglins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |       |
| Crimson Forest   | The biome is named for its red color, and is covered by the canopies ofhuge, tree-like fungi. Huge, pig-like animals calledhoglinsroam around thenylium-covered terrain, while tribes ofpiglinshunt them for food. This makes it one of the only biomes to have an ecosystem. While not as numerous as in thenether wastes, the occasionalzombified piglinalso roams, and if near normal piglins, it scares them away.It is also one of the more habitable biomes in the Nether, due to hoglins being a source of food in the dimension, and despite being a hostile mob, it can be bred, making it perfect for farms in the dimension.                                                                                                        |       |
| Warped Forest    | This forest-type biome has the most amount offlorain the Nether dimension (due to the additionalnether sproutsthat are found only within the biome) but also has only twomobs, those being theendermenand the occasionalstrider. The amount of endermen here makes the biome an ideal place to collectender pearlsbefore the player has access tothe Enddimension.The low diversity of mobs here makes it another habitable place in the Nether, since no mobs spawned here are naturally hostile to the player.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |       |
| Soul Sand Valley | Thisdesert-like biome is dangerous, not just because of the huge caverns and darkness that can allow numbers ofghastsandskeletonsto spawn, but also due to the deposits ofsoul sand, which slows down theplayer.Bootsenchanted withSoul Speedallow the player to avoid the slowing effect of soul sand. Bluish-coloredsoul fireis common here and are more dangerous than regular fires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |       |
| Basalt Deltas    | With high amounts oflavaandmagma cubes, this is one of the most dangerous biomes in the game. The terrain consists of steep and spikybasaltformations along with the flatterdeltas. When the biome collides with alava sea, archipelagos of basalt andgravelform. The biome is almost impossible to build in, which might explain whybastion remnantsdon’t generate here (unless abastion remnantgenerates in a bordering biome).Even though the magma cubes here are dangerous, their spawning rate makes the biome ideal for collecting magma cream, which can be used for brewing Fire Resistance potions. Blackstone also generates more commonly here than in other Nether biomes, making the basalt deltas ideal for making stone tools. |       |

### Generated structures
Main article: Structure § The Nether
The Nether contains a variety of unique generated structures. Though equally vast, it contains far fewer types of generated structures than the Overworld.

| Name            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Image |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Nether fortress | Nether fortresses are large, castle-like structures that are composed ofnether bricks. This structure is often found bridging overlava seas, or tunnelling throughnetherrack.This structure is the only place blazes and wither skeletons spawn, making fortresses the gateway to both bosses in the game: the ender dragon and the wither. Fortresses also contain blaze monster spawners, as well as small nether wart farms where nether wart can be obtained. Nether fortresses can be found in all Nether biomes. |       |
| Nether fossil   | Nether fossils are structures comprised ofbone blocks. These structures have 14 different designs. Unlikefossilsin theOverworld,coal oredoes not generate within these fossils. This structure generates exclusively withinsoul sand valleybiomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       |
| Bastion remnant | Bastion remnants are large fortifications made up ofblackstone,blackstone bricksandbasalt. A large amount ofgold blocksandloot chestscan be found within these structures. They generate in four distinct variants, each with its own unique structure and loot. These structures are inhabited by thepiglinsandpiglin brutes, and in certain variantshoglinsas well. These structures generate within any Nether biome except for thebasalt deltas.                                                                   |       |
| Ruined portal   | A structure containing what appears to be a destroyednether portaland various types ofstoneorblackstonematerials, when generating in the Overworld or the Nether, respectively. Netherrack generates on the ground around the portal, and achestcontaining loot generates with the structure.These structures can be found in any Overworld and Nether biome.                                                                                                                                                          |       |

### Terrain features
The Nether has a lot of different terrain features that generate within the biomes of the Nether. 

| Name           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                | Image |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Lava sea       | Lava seas generate at and belowlevel 31in all Nether biomes.Striders can be found striding across these seas.                                                                                              |       |
| Glowstone blob | Glowstone blobs generate on the ceiling of the Nether in all biomes.                                                                                                                                       |       |
| Basalt pillar  | Basalt pillars generate insoul sand valleybiomes and on thelava seaspresent there.                                                                                                                         |       |
| Delta          | Deltas are sheets of constrainedlavaandmagma blocksfound among the terrain ofbasalt deltasbiomes.                                                                                                          |       |
| Hidden lava    | Single blocks oflavaare buried withinnetherrackin all Nether biomes. These are particularly dangerous when mining in the Nether, as the lava can quickly flow out and overwhelm the player when uncovered. |       |
