## Drops
- Amilk bucket(8.5% chance, increased 1% per level ofLooting) if killed while holding or before finishing drinking.
- Apotion of invisibility(8.5% chance, increased 1% per level ofLooting) if killed while holding or before finishing drinking.

A wandering trader is also a source of leads, as it typically spawns with two leashed trader llamas. These leads break and drop (at the location of the llama) if either trader or llama dies or if they are separated.

Separating mobs upon leads have the connection broken, dropping the leads if they enter boats for example.  Unless they enter the same boat at the same time, every lead is always broken if at least one moves into a boat.

Wandering traders do not drop any loot when they despawn.

Wandering traders do not reward any experience when killed or when the player successfully trades with the wandering trader.
