## Behavior
Llama spit that hits an entity deals 1 damage. Despite the spit being a projectile, dying from llama spit still shows the death message "<player> was slain by trader llama/llama." In Bedrock, however, the death message is "<player> was spitballed by trader llama/llama".

The spit entity must belong to an entity to do damage, meaning that a spit entity summoned by commands does no damage unless its Owner NBT attribute matches the UUID of an entity in loaded chunks. 

In Bedrock Edition, llama spit can be deflected if hit by the player.

Llama spit can not pass through any blocks, including non-solid blocks (ex. signs, open fencegate & sugarcane); this even includes water. The spitting animation still shows the trajectory but the spit entity that does damage terminates on the non-solid block.

Llama spit can be blocked by a shield.
