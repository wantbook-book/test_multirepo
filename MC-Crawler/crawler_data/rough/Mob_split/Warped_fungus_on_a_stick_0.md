### Mob loot
A zombified piglin that spawns as a strider jockey holds a warped fungus on a stick instead of a golden sword, and has an 8.5%‌[JE  only] or 25%‌[BE  only] chance to drop it if killed by a player or tamed wolf, or upon death when angry. chance is increased by 1%‌[JE  only] or 5%‌[BE  only] per level of Looting, for a maximum of 11.5%‌[JE  only] or 40%‌[BE  only] with Looting III.

## Usage
A player shown using a warped fungus on a stick to ride a strider (click to see animation).
Similar to how a carrot on a stick is used to control pigs, the players can use a warped fungus on a stick to control a strider. To do this, the player simply holds the item in one hand and any nearby striders within view is attracted toward the player. If mounted on a saddled strider, the strider moves in the direction the player is facing while holding the warped fungus on a stick. Right clicking with the item makes the strider go faster, but reduces the item's durability by 1 for every speed boost. The boost lasts between 140 and 980 game ticks (7 seconds and 49 seconds respectively), chosen randomly. If the item durability reaches 0, it turns into a fishing rod.

Due to a strider's ability to walk on lava, this is a beneficial tool for using striders as a safe transport across the Nether's terrain, which is otherwise considered difficult to traverse.
