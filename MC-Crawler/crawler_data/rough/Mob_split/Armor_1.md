### Mob loot
Zombies, skeletons, and their variants that spawn with armor have a small chance of dropping their armor when killed by the player. When killed, the armor they drop can vary from 0 to full durability. Upon death, zombies, zombie villagers, skeletons, zombified piglins, and wither skeletons always drop any armor that they picked up and equipped. They may also be wearing enchanted armor that retains the enchantment when dropped.

Rarely, a mob can drop a chainmail armor item. This is the only other way to obtain chainmail armor besides finding it in buried treasure or trading with villagers.

In Bedrock Edition, pillagers and vindicators that spawn in raids have a small chance to drop an iron helmet, iron chestplate, iron leggings, or iron boots, in a badly damaged state, with a possibility of having a random enchantment.

In Java Edition, armorer villagers throw chainmail armor to players who have the Hero of the Village status effect.

### Trading
Leather armor can be bought from leatherworker villagers. These armor pieces have randomly determined color.

Iron armor, chainmail armor and enchanted diamond armor can be bought from armorer villagers.

### Bartering
Piglins may barter iron boots enchanted with Soul Speed when given a gold ingot.

### Fishing
Leather boots, often badly damaged, can be obtained as a junk item from fishing.

## Armor modification
Once an armor piece has been obtained, it can be modified in a number of ways.

### Trimming
Armor can be trimmed with an armor trim and an ingot or crystal. Trimming changes the visual appearance of armor.

### Repairing
Armor can be repaired by placing two pieces of the same type (e.g., iron helmets) in a grindstone or in the crafting grid. The resulting item has 5% more durability left than the original items combined, but any enchantments are lost. If the total durability of both of the armor pieces is more than the total durability that a piece of armor would have fresh from a crafting table, the extra durability is lost. Repairing armor with an anvil preserves and combines the enchantments, with a rising experience cost for subsequent repairs on the same item.

#### Grinding

|---------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Two matching armor pieces |                 | Thedurabilityof the two armor pieces is added together, plus an extra 5% durability. |

#### Unit repair
Main article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair
A piece of armor can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the armor material's repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% of the armor item's maximum durability, rounded down. Chainmail armor can be repaired in an anvil using iron ingots. Netherite armor can be repaired in an anvil using netherite ingots.

## Protection value
Armor points count for less as the attack strength increases: each 2 done by the attack reduces the effective defense points by 1 (), but not below 20% of the armor points. In short, the stronger the attack force, the less the armor points protect the player.

- Minimum: the lowest percentage that the full set protects from a strong attack. Each point just protects 0.8%.
- Maximum: the highest percentage each tier protects.
- Protection: the fourth level adds 16 percent of protection to the final calculation.
- Increased toughness means less armor defense point reduction from strong attacks.

More information on this can be seen in § Mechanics below.

| Full sets | Minimum | Older versions and current maximum |
|-----------|---------|------------------------------------|
| Leather   | 5.6%    | 28%                                |
| Golden    | 8.8%    | 44%                                |
| Chainmail | 9.6%    | 48%                                |
| Iron      | 12%     | 60%                                |
| Diamond   | 16%     | 80%                                |
| Netherite | 16%     | 80%                                |

## Usage
To have any protective effect, armor must be worn by the player. A helmet, chestplate, leggings, and boots are equipped by placing them in the  head,  chest,  legs and  feet slots of the inventory next to the player's character, respectively. Armor can also be equipped by right clicking while held. If the respective slot already contains a piece of armor, they are swapped, and the original armor ends up in the player's hand.

A chestplate provides the most protection per unit of material, followed by leggings. For leather, iron, and diamond armor, boots have equivalent armor points as the helmet, but for chainmail and gold armor, the helmet trumps boots. A turtle shell, in addition to providing protection, also gives the player the Water Breathing status effect.

Each armor piece consumes one inventory slot. They cannot be stacked.

If wearing any piece of gold armor, piglins become neutral toward the player; however, piglin brutes remain hostile. If wearing any piece of leather armor, a player is immune to freezing damage and FOV change. If wearing leather boots, players may walk on powder snow. This grants the "Light as a Rabbit" achievement.  

### Tiers
Main article: Armor materials
There are seven different types of materials of armor, including turtle shells. The six full sets are shown below in order from weakest (offers the least protection and is the least durable) to strongest (offers the most protection and is the most durable).

- Leather (on Steve)
- Golden (on Steve)
- Chainmail (on Steve)
- Iron (on Steve)
- Diamond (on Steve)
- Netherite (on Steve)

- Leather (on Alex)
- Golden (on Alex)
- Chainmail (on Alex)
- Iron (on Alex)
- Diamond (on Alex)
- Netherite (on Alex)

#### Other
Certain items provide beneficial effects when worn, but provide no protection against damage.

A carved pumpkin can be worn in the helmet slot. It partially blocks the player's vision, but prevents endermen from becoming aggressive when the player looks at them.

Mob heads can be worn in the helmet slot. They cut a player's detection range by 50% for the corresponding mob type ‌[JE  only], a bonus that stacks with potions of Invisibility and sneaking.

Elytra are worn in the chestplate slot, allowing the wearer to glide through the air.

The Turtle Shell is not part of a full set. However, its defense points match gold, chainmail, and iron helmets, while its durability is between iron and diamond helmets (276). Additionally, it gives the player water breathing when worn. In the game's code, its protection is equivalent to iron armor.
