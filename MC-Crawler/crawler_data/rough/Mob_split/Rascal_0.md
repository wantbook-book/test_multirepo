# Rascal
The rascal was a proposed mob featured in the Mob Vote during Minecraft Live 2022, alongside the sniffer and tuff golem.[1] It was a mob that would have been found underground in areas below y=0. The rascal would have given the player hints to help search for it, and would have also given the player an item if it was found three times. Once the rascal had given the player the item it would have teleported away.[2]

In the preview video, an iron pickaxe is shown being given by the rascal. However, that was just one example of the items it would have given the player.[3]

The rascal lost the vote with only 27.7% of the votes.
