## Effect
Increases melee damage by 3 × level in Java Edition. Negative levels decrease melee damage, with attacks being ignored entirely if damage would be 0 or lower.

In Bedrock Edition, melee damage under the Strength effect can be found through the equation BaseDamage×1.3level+1.3level−10.3, where BaseDamage is the default damage of whatever weapon or tool is used to attack.[1] Example for an iron sword:

- Normal: 7
- Level 1: 10.1× 5.05
- Level 2: 14.13× 7.065
