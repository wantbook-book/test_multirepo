## Spawning
Elder guardian ghosts can be spawned using commands, such as /summon elder_guardian_ghost.

## Behavior
An elder guardian ghost burning
Elder guardian ghosts are invisible and have defensive spikes that deal 2.

When the elder guardian ghost spawns outside of water, it floats upward until it despawns, similar to a mob tied to a balloon, or under a high level of Levitation effect, but it passes through blocks. 

The elder guardian ghost itself isn't immune to suffocation damage. It behaves similar to custom mobs added in behavior packs with broken AI; the mobs float upward and pass through blocks when hit. 

If an elder guardian ghost is spawned underwater, it slowly sinks downward, passing through all blocks (including bedrock), until it eventually it falls into the void and dies. When underwater, the elder guardian ghost can rotate its body, look at players, and swim while slowly sinking downward.

The elder guardian ghost can be affected by the Instant Health effect and increase its health, and its maximum health can reach 3.4*10^38 Ã— 1.7E+38.[1]

Elder guardian ghosts inflict Mining Fatigue III when spawned in Survival or Adventure.
