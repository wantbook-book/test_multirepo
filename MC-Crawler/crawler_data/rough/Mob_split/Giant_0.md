## Drops
A giant drops 5 when killed and has a chance of dropping some of its equipment if it has any.

## Spawning
No biome includes giants on their spawn lists, so they can never spawn naturally.

Additionally, giants simultaneously require a light level greater than 11 and less than 8. This effectively makes it impossible to make them appear through monster spawners.

Giants also have no spawn egg in the Creative inventory.

### Commands
Giants can be spawned using commands such as /summon minecraft:giant.

## Behavior
Giants are close to 12 blocks tall, and it uses a six-times-enlarged zombie model.

Because giants are not actually undead, they do not burn in sunlight and they are damaged by potions of Harming and healed by potions of Healing, are attacked by the wither, immune to Smite, affected by Regeneration and Poison, and do not scare armadillos. Iron golems and snow golems attack giants as they attack other hostile mobs.

Giants also do not convert into drowned when submerged in water. Instead, they slowly suffocate and die. 

Giants currently have no AI. The consequence of this is that they always face south when summoned, and they always stay that way, never wandering. They cannot turn their head, chase the player, or respond to damage. A giant can never receive knockback, and a giant's viewing direction can be changed only with commands or by shoving it into a minecart that faces a different direction.

Giants can move if ridden by another mob using NBT tags.
