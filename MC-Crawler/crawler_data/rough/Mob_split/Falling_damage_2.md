### Critical hit
"Critical hit" redirects here.  For the enchantment in Minecraft Dungeons, see Critical Hit.
A critical hit performed on a sheep.
A critical hit is an attack that deals extra damage compared to a regular attack. Critical melee strikes, regardless of the weapon used, cause small star, cross shaped particles to fly out of the target who was critically hit. Critical hits can only be performed if the attack cooldown of the weapon is at 84.8% or higher. Arrows shot from crossbows and fully charged bows leave a trail of the same small star particles as they fly through the air. Critical hits affect all damageable entities including players, mobs, and armor stands, but excluding paintings, boats, minecarts or the ender dragon‌[Java Edition  only].

In melee combat, a critical hit occurs when a player attacks a mob while falling, including while coming down from a jump, but not while jumping up. The attack deals 150% of the attack's base damage (after strength is applied and before‌[JE  only] / after‌[BE  only] enchantments or armor are applied).

Ordinarily, players cannot perform critical hits while sprinting, because a sprint-knockback attack is performed instead. However, by continuing to hold down the sprint key after performing a sprint-knockback attack, all successive hits can be critical hits, and sprint-knockback attacks become impossible until the sprint key is released.‌[Java Edition  only] In Bedrock Edition and the Java Edition Combat Tests, players can perform critical hits and sprint-knockback attacks simultaniously.

The requirements for a melee critical hit are:

- A player must befalling.
- A player must not be on the ground.
- A player must not be on aladderor any type ofvine.
- A player must not be inwater.
- A player must not be affected byBlindness.
- A player must not be affected bySlow Falling.
- A player must not be riding anentity.
- A player must not beflying.
- The attack cooldown must not be below 84.8%.‌[Java Edition  only]

### Maximum damage dealt
In Survival mode, the maximum damage that can be dealt by a player depends on various factors as described below.

** Melee attack **
- InJava Edition
	- 36.5× 18.25damage, consisting of 10from a netheriteaxe+ 6fromStrengthII, all × 1.5 from a critical hit (+ 8damage), + 12.5× 6.25damage fromSmiteV on an undead target, orBane of ArthropodsV on an arthropod.
	- The maximum on a non-undead non-arthropod target is only 27× 13.5: 10from a netherite axe + 6fromStrengthII, all × 1.5 from a critical hit (+ 8damage), + 3damage fromSharpnessV. A full set ofProtectionIV netheritearmorwould reduce the 27× 13.5damage to 4.044× 2.022.
	- By use of amacesmash attack, the maximum damage that can be dealt by a player is infinite.
- InBedrock Edition
	- Maximum damage to undeads or arthropods is 41.25× 20.625damage, consisting of 8from netherite sword + 12.5× 6.25from Smite V for undead mobs or Bane of Arthropods V for arthropod mobs + 7from strength II, all × 1.5 from a critical hit (+ 13.75× 6.875damage).
	- Maximum damage to non-undead and non-arthropod on land is 31.875× 15.9375damage, consisting of 8from netherite sword + 6.25× 3.125from Sharpness V + 7from Strength II, all × 1.5 from a critical hit (+ 10.625× 5.3125damage).
	- Maximum damage to players and mobs on water or during rain is 42.75× 21.375damage, consisting of 9of melee trident + 12.5× 6.25from Impaling V + 7from strength II, all × 1.5 from a critical hit (+ 14.25× 7.125damage). (Also work withRiptide)
	- By use of amacesmash attack, the maximum damage that can be dealt by a player is infinite.

** Ranged attack **
- With bow:
	- Maximum damage to players and mobs is 25× 12.5damage from a critical shot from a bow with thePowerV enchantment. Because the instantaneous effects of arrows don't stack with arrow damage and apply during immunity phase, using harming (or healing arrows to undead mobs) doesn't add bonus damage unless the target has enough armor or Projectile Protection levels so the damage dealt by the arrow is lower than the magical damage effect after Protection/Resistance reduction. This is sufficient to kill most mobs in one hit though.
- With crossbow:
	- Maximum damage to players and non-undead mobs is 64× 32damage, consisting of a single shot of three arrows of harming II from multishot enchantment that hit single mobs. Two of the arrows deal 9damage while one of them deals 10+ 36× 18damage from instant damage II effect (12× 6per arrow).
	- Maximum damage to undead mobs is 52× 26damage, consisting of a single shot of three arrows of healing II from multishot enchantment that hit single mobs. Two of the arrows deal 9damage while one of them deals 10+ 24× 12damage from instant health II effect (8per arrow).

## Immunity
After sustaining damage from any source, a mob/player turns red for half a second. During this period, it is immune to most kinds of further damage. For instance, if the player attacks a mob by repeatedly hitting the attack button, attacks that land while the mob is immune deal no damage, and does not reduce the durability of a melee weapon. Unsuccessful attacks also do not anger neutral mobs.

During the immunity period, any damage which is equal to or less than the original damage that caused the immunity is ignored. However, any higher damage (before accounting for armor, enchantments, or status effects) causes only the difference between the original and new damage amounts to be dealt. For example, if a mob is attacked with a weapon dealing 7 damage and then attacked with another weapon dealing 12 × 6 damage during the immunity period, the second hit deals 5 damage (resulting in 12 × 6 total). This does not reset the immunity period.

When an attack deals a fatal amount of damage to a mob, so that it dies while immune, its death sound is not triggered. ‌[Java Edition  only]
