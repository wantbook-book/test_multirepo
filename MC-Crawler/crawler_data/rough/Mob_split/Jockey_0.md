# Jockey
Jockey refers to a naturally spawned mob riding another mob. Jockeys are named based on the mob being ridden. They also follow the spawning patterns of the bottom mob. The mob on the top often controls the mob on the bottom in Java Edition, but sometimes do not control it in Bedrock Edition. See Riding for detailed behavior about riding.
