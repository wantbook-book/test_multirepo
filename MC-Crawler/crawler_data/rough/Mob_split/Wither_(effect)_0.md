# Wither (effect)
Wither is a status effect that inflicts damage over time. It acts similarly to Poison, save for the fact that it acts slower, can do so against the undead, and can kill.

It can be cured by drinking milk.

## Mechanic
Wither is an effect that keeps damaging the player as it continues. Unlike Poison, it can affect undead mobs, deals less damage per second, and can kill. It is usually difficult for the player to see how much health they have left, as it turns the player's health bar black.

## Effect
An animation of HP when it receives a "Wither" status for 5 seconds (level 2).
The amount of damage inflicted to the affected entity is shown in the table below:

| Level      | Ticks per | per second |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| 1          | 40        | 0.5× 0.25  |
| 2          | 20        | 1          |
| 3          | 10        | 2          |
| 4[note 1]  | 5         | 4          |
| 5[note 1]  | 2         | 10         |
| 6+[note 1] | 1         | 20× 10     |


↑ a b c Due to damage immunity, the effective rate is 10 ticks ( × 1 per second) at levels 4 and up.


The player's hearts turn black ( on Survival mode or  on Hardcore‌[Java Edition  only] mode), making it more difficult, but still possible, for the player to see their health. Death is reported as "<player> withered away".
Amplifiers outside the range 0–31 (corresponding to levels 1–32) use modulo 32.

↑ In Java Edition the effect is being refreshed every tick, causing it to apply damage at the same rate. Effectively this causes 1 () damage every 10 ticks (instead of every 2 seconds) to living entities due to damage immunity while the entity touches the block.


## Immune mobs
Wither skeletons, withers and ender dragons are immune to Wither, while witches are 85% resistant to damage from Wither.
