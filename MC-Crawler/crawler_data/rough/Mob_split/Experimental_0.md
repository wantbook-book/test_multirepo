# Experiments
Experiments (also known as Experimental Gameplay or Experimental Features in Bedrock Edition) are game options in Bedrock Edition or data packs in Java Edition. When an experiment is enabled, it allows players to test some unfinished or work-in-progress features that may eventually be released in future updates.

## Toggling
Experiments are found in the world options when creating or editing a world. When turning an experiment on in an existing world, a copy of the world is created automatically. Turning an experiment on disables achievements for the world. Once the world is created with an experiment on, the experiment cannot be turned off again. Worlds with the experiments on have an "Experimental" tag next to the game mode name in the world menu.

## Warnings
The warning message when attempting to play on an experimental world.
The point of Experiments is for the player to look at some not-quite-finished features, which could crash, break, change, or stop working at any point in future updates. When the player attempts to load the experimental world, it shows a warning message before loading it. Attempting to disable Experiments toggle via external tools could also crash and break the world.

It is recommended to create back up copies of the world before enabling any experiments to avoid breaking the world and having issues in future updates.
