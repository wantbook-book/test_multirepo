## Generation
Lunar bases generate in the moon biome. They have a 1⁄1024 chance to generate in a given chunk. [more information needed]

## Structure
Main article: Lunar Base/Structure
Lunar bases look similar to a moon rover at first, with a dropper renamed to "ACME Self-Building Lunar Base" at the center. Pressing the golden pressure plate located on the rover, however, starts building an enormous lunar base. Adding objects to the dropper does not seem to change construction, although having blocks above it prevents it from starting to expand.

## Loot
Loot in the Lunar Base is located in two types of containers: chests, named "Moon Mission Resupply Crate" and green shulker boxes, named "Lunar Laboratory Equipment". The first one generates basic resources to survive on the Moon, like dirt, saplings and vegetables to farm. The second one can generate items unobtainable in normal Survival gameplay - spawn eggs and budding amethyst, as well as a large variety of other items.

### Moon Mission Resuply Crate
In Java Edition, each moon resuply chest contains  items drawn from 3 pools,  with the following distribution:
