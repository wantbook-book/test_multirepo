## Block drops
Most blocks drop themselves when broken - sometimes Silk Touch enchantment or a specific tool is required. All other cases, when blocks drop something different (or don't drop anything), are listed below. Unbreakable blocks, like bedrock, are not listed. "Obtainable with Silk Touch" column indicates if the block can be collected using the Silk Touch enchantment. See Silk Touch#Obtainable blocks for more information. Fortune enchantment can affect number of block drops and probabilities (but not the type) as well, see Fortune#Usage for more information.
