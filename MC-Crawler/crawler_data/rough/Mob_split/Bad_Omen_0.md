## Effect
Bad Omen's potency determines the chance for illagers to be equipped with enchanted weapons when the player triggers a raid by entering a certain radius around a villager-claimed POI (bed, job site, or bell). If the raid results in player victory, the Hero of the Village's potency equals the Bad Omen's potency (capped at level 5). Bad Omen levels past the first also give a single extra raid wave, given the difficulty level. For example, with Bad Omen II-V in Easy difficulty raid has four waves instead of three, Normal difficulty has six waves instead of five, and Hard difficulty has eight waves instead of seven.‌[JE  only][1]

Bad Omen is a status effect and can be removed through all conventional methods, such as drinking milk or dying.

The player can still receive the Bad Omen effect in Peaceful difficulty via commands (all pillager captains despawn in Peaceful), but does not trigger a raid if in a village.

### Upcoming

  

This section describes an experimental feature in Java Edition. 
This feature is not enabled in-game by default and requires enabling the "Update 1.21" experimental data pack in Java Edition.



  

This section describes content that may be included in Bedrock Edition. 
This content has appeared in Bedrock Edition 1.21.0 development versions, but the full update containing it has not been released yet.


Bad Omen can be obtained by consuming an ominous bottle, obtained from either raid captains outside of a raid or from vaults. Being affected by Bad Omen allows players to initiate ominous events.

If a player enters a village with Bad Omen, it transforms into Raid Omen, which triggers a raid after a 30 second delay. The enchantment level of the incoming raiders' equipment is increased depending on the level of the omen, and the resulting Hero of the Village effect matches the level of the omen, if all raiders have been defeated with villagers still alive. In the experiment, Raid Omen replaces Bad Omen's previous function.

If the player has the Bad Omen effect and goes near a non-ominous trial spawner, it transforms into Trial Omen, which converts all nearby trial spawners into ominous trial spawners that are significantly harder to deal with and also have better loot. The omen lasts for 15 minutes multiplied by the level of the Bad Omen. Defeating an ominous trial spawner allows the player to obtain ominous trial keys, which in turn open ominous vaults that can drop loot of significantly higher quality, including exclusive smithing templates and heavy cores needed to craft the mace.

## Immune mobs

  

This section describes an experimental feature in Java Edition and Bedrock Edition. 
This feature is not enabled in-game by default and requires enabling the "Update 1.21" experimental data pack in Java Edition or the "Update 1.21" setting in the "Experiments" section in Bedrock Edition.


Only bosses like withers and ender dragons are immune to Bad Omen; however, only players can trigger ominous events like raids and ominous trials. Other mobs with Bad Omen cannot trigger ominous events.
