## Events
These events are not tied to generated village structures, but these structures (except for abandoned villages) typically satisfy the game's definition in the context of village mechanics. Specifically, these events consider any chunk section (aka. "subchunk") within a 3×3×3 cube of sections centered on a section containing a bed, bell, or job site as part of a village.

### Raids
Main article: Raid
A player who kills an illager captain (found in an outpost or a patrol) receives the Bad Omen effect for 100 minutes. Like other status effects, Bad Omen can also be cleared by dying or drinking milk. Entering a village boundary while the effect is active triggers a raid, in which groups of illagers spawn and attack the village. Killing multiple captains in Java Edition gives the player a higher level of Bad Omen, and the higher the level, the higher the chance for the raiding mobs to wield enchanted weapons.

### Zombie sieges
Main article: Zombie siege

  

This feature is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


Zombie sieges are in-game events where many zombies spawn in a village, regardless of how well lit or walled off a village is. They have a 10% chance of occurring at midnight every night or during thunderstorms when a village has at least 20 valid beds. There is no indication of a zombie siege happening except for an unusually high number of zombies.

### Buildings
The number of buildings making up a village can vary, and not every village consists of all building types at once. Apart from the meeting point, which is unique and systematic, the number of buildings of each type is randomly generated and increased in superflat‌[Java Edition  only] worlds. More than one meeting point can generate in superflat worlds. The number of lamp posts and decorative structures (hay bales, melon patch, pumpkin patch, farms, snow and ice patches) has no restriction, as they are generated where no other buildings can be placed. These structures could have functions, and could be of great use to the player. Paths are found between the buildings of the village and often extend beyond them.

Structures are chosen randomly from a pool of possible buildings. 

The full list of the village house blueprints can be accessed by going here.

Architecture style, and blocks making up the village structures, vary according to village type. Not every building can generate in a single village, although some blocks can be found in any village, such as job site blocks and food items. Buildings have different probabilities of generating, depending on village type; for example, a weaponsmith shop is more likely to appear in a Taiga village than other villages.

In Bedrock Edition, villages don't generate with expected structures; for example, a fletcher house doesn't appear in a plains village and a stone mason house doesn't appear in a savanna village.[1]

### Paths
Village paths without any buildings nearby, generated in a Buffet world type with cave generation before Village and Pillage.
Villages generate paths between the buildings and extending outside of the village. Village paths generate at the level of existing terrain, potentially going up steep hills or down ravines without regard for whether an entity could actually traverse the path. Paths do not go below sea level and replace only grass blocks (with air above), water, lava, sand, sandstone, and red sandstone; all other blocks are ignored and the blocks underneath are considered for replacement instead. Villagers use these paths to travel across the village.

In plains, savanna, taiga, and snowy villages, paths are comprised of dirt paths and grass. Savanna villages also generate farmland and crops in some paths. Dirt paths that generate over water are replaced by the village style's planks type. Desert villages generate with smooth sandstone paths. 

In Buffet worlds with cave generation, paths may generate on a separate layer from the rest of the buildings. In floating island generation, paths may not generate at all.

Trees, lamp posts, and other decorative structures can generate in the middle of paths as obstructions.[2]

## Abandoned villages
Not to be confused with Zombie Town.

A plains abandoned village in creative mode.
A village has a 2% chance of generating as an abandoned village (also known as zombie village).

In an abandoned village, all generated villagers are instead zombie villagers, and all doors and torches are missing. The zombie villagers do not despawn, but have no resistance to sunlight. The zombie villagers spawned inside these villages behave similar to drowned as they stay in the shade even when a player or villager are nearby, only coming out when the sun has set. In abandoned villages, most cobblestone blocks are replaced by mossy cobblestone, random blocks (particularly wood) are replaced by cobwebs, and all glass panes are replaced by brown stained glass panes to represent dirty glass. Abandoned villages also spawn stray cats, as well as the usual village livestock, but they do not spawn iron golems. The amount of buildings in an abandoned village can be slightly more than a normal village.
