# Crab
The crab was a proposed mob featured in the Mob Vote during Minecraft Live 2023, alongside the armadillo and penguin.[1] It would have spawned in mangrove swamps, and had a large arm that it could lose, dropping a crab claw. The crab claw could be used to place blocks from further away. Crabs could be bred with kelp. Crabs occasionally waved at players and other crabs.

The crab lost the vote with only 32.5% of the votes.
