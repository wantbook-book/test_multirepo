### Breeding
A turtle lays eggs after digging.
Feeding two turtles seagrass results in them entering love mode and one of the turtles becoming pregnant. The pregnant turtle has eggs in its body and is therefore about 0.2 blocks taller than normal.

#### Egg laying
The turtle then travels back to its home position, which is where it first spawned. The turtle does not stop traveling until is is within a 9-block distance from its home position. Upon arrival, it seeks a nearby sand block on which to lay its eggs. Then, it spends a few seconds digging vigorously while turning 360 degrees a few times. Finally, it lays a cluster of 1–4 turtle eggs, as a single block. Turtles have a cooldown of 90 seconds (1800 game ticks) after breeding in Bedrock Edition, or 5 minutes (300 seconds; 6000 game ticks) in Java Edition.

#### Egg hatching
Main article: Turtle Egg § Hatching
Turtle eggs can be placed on any block in clusters of up to 4, however, they hatch only on sand, red sand, or suspicious sand, above or below water. Eggs can be broken without tools and can also be trampled by living entities falling or walking on them. When a cluster is trampled, the eggs crack and break one at a time. A turtle can walk on turtle eggs without breaking them.

Turtle eggs progress toward hatching by cracking. Cracking occurs during random ticks, and an egg hatches once it has cracked 3 times. When a cluster of eggs hatches, all eggs within the block hatch simultaneously. Eggs grow faster during the night and typically take 4 to 5 in-game days to hatch. Mining a cluster of turtle eggs with Silk Touch causes it to drop one egg at a time, which the player can collect. Eggs do not preserve the cracking stage when harvested.

### Babies
With a height of 0.12 blocks, baby turtles are among the smallest mobs in the game. Baby turtles are small enough that when they walk on soul sand, they are entirely within the space at the top of the block.

Upon hatching, baby turtles search for the nearest water block within a 47×1×47 region two blocks below the turtle and attempt to approach it.

Baby turtles take one Minecraft day to grow up (20 minutes). The growth can be accelerated using seagrass. Each use reduces the remaining growth duration by 10%. Upon becoming an adult, the turtle drops a turtle scute.

### Entity data
Turtles have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.

Java Edition:

Main article: Entity format
- Entity data
	- 
	- Additional fields for mobs that can breed
	- 
	- Tags common to all entities
	- 
	- Tags common to all mobs
	- HasEgg:1or0(true/false) -truemeans the turtle is currently pregnant.
	- Coordinates of the block where the turtle spawned:
	- HomePosX: X coordinate.
	- HomePosY: Y coordinate.
	- HomePosZ: Z coordinate.
	- Coordinates for a point that the turtle sometimes tries to swim to while in the water. These are chosen at random in order to make the turtle swim around randomly:
	- TravelPosX: X coordinate.
	- TravelPosY: Y coordinate.
	- TravelPosZ: Z coordinate.
