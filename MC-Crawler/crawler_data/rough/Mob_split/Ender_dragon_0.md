# Ender Dragon
The ender dragon is a giant flying hostile boss mob found when first entering the End. It is the largest naturally spawning mob in the game. It guards access to the end gateways that provide entry to the outer end islands in addition to the exit portal that allows return to the Overworld as well as access to the end credits of Minecraft. Its attacks involve charging at the player and hurling its acidic breath at them.

## Spawning
### Initial spawning
The ender dragon spawns 20 game ticks (1 second) after an entity first arrives in the End, along with the bedrock frame for the exit portal.

### Re-summoning
This image shows how the player can arrange end crystals to respawn the ender dragon.
Players can re-summon the dragon by placing four end crystals on the edges of the exit portal, one on each side. If the exit portal is ever destroyed, end crystals can be placed on obsidian blocks at the precise location where the original exit portal once stood. When it is re-summoned, the four end crystals point to the tops of each pillar setting off a series of explosions that resets the obsidian pillars, iron bars, and end crystals. The top of each pillar explodes, destroying any player-placed blocks. Eventually, all of the end crystals point at the coordinates of (0.0, 128, 0.0) and the ender dragon spawns there. The four crystals placed around the exit portal then explode. If the player does not pick up the dragon egg and starts to re-summon the dragon, the dragon egg disappears.

If the dragon goes through an end gateway, another immediately spawns at (0, 128, 0) while the other dragon flies to (0, 128, 0).

## Drops
After the ender dragon is slain for the first time, the following events take place:

- First, it moves to the exit portal. During this final move, the dragon can still damage other entities, despite being "dead".
- When it reaches 0,0 it slowly ascends, its wings and body becoming more tattered until it disappears in beams of light erupting from its center. A very loud sound, "Ender dragon death.ogg" is played.
- There's an explosion of12000experiencepoints (ten drops of 960 and one drop of 2400) — enough to bring a player from no experience all the way up to level 68. Some of the experience orbs can drop into the exit portal. The experience orbs can then be retrieved in the Overworld.
- The bedrock structure fills in with an end portal interface to become theexit portal, enabling the player to transport back to theOverworldandrespawnat their spawn point, or atworld spawnif they didn't set a spawn point.
- Adragon eggappears above the island's central bedrock structure. If a block exists right above the center of the central bedrock structure, then the dragon egg spawns 1 block above the highest block at (0,0). If the highest block is at the height limit, then the dragon egg does not spawn.
- Anend gateway portalis generated floating within 75–100 blocks of the exit portal.

When a re-summoned ender dragon is slain, the same events occur except that only 500 experience points are dropped‌[Java Edition  only] and no more than 20 gateway portals are generated. The dragon egg appears only the first time the ender dragon is slain in Java Edition, and the first and second time in Bedrock Edition; it does not appear after any subsequent dragon slaying.

## Behavior
See also: Tutorials/Defeating the ender dragon

During the battle with the ender dragon, unique music called "Boss" plays, the edges of the screen darkens, black fog appears, and chunks around the exit portal are constantly loaded regardless of render distance. These happen as long as there is at least one player within a Euclidean distance of 192 blocks from (0.0, 128, 0.0).

The ender dragon has a light purple health bar that appears at the top of the player's screen. Its health is frequently restored by nearby end crystals, indicated by a magical white beam connecting the dragon and the crystal. Destroying an end crystal that is actively healing the dragon causes 10 damage to it. 

The dragon can take damage only from explosions and player-based damage, and takes damage of (normal damage ÷ 4 + 1) when hit on any part that is not its head, rendering it the most resilient mob in the game, despite it having less health than the wither. In Java Edition, although the particle is displayed, critical hits do not apply to the ender dragon, since it can only be applied to living entities. While the ender dragon is a living entity, the parts that are damaged are actually ender dragon parts which are non-mob entities. Suffocation is completely non-applicable, as it either phases through or immediately destroys any block it touches.

The dragon is immune to all status effects, except for Instant Damage - if it's player-based damage (the player threw a splash or lingering potion of Harming). Hovewer, hitting the dragon with a potion may prove tricky.

The green hitboxes of the ender dragon.
By using the F3 + B shortcut, the dragon's bounding box appears.‌[Java Edition  only] However, it cannot be damaged at just any spot in this large volume: eight green sub-hitboxes are also shown, which indicate the locations where the dragon can take damage: the tail, body, head, and wings.

The ender dragon is immune to fire, falling, drowning, freezing, poisoning, and even the void.
