## Gameplay
### Bedrock Edition
Multiplayer works using a server, which allows players to play online or via a local area network with other people. There are various customization options that can be set by operators. These settings depend on the type of server and can create many different multiplayer experiences. 

To change multiplayer settings in Bedrock Edition, the world owner has to go to the world settings while not in the world, then select the "Multiplayer" tab, and are then given some options. 

The first option is "Multiplayer Game". This option allows world owners to decide who can join them over Wi-Fi, by selecting an option on the "Microsoft Account Settings" dropdown. 

- If they select "Invite Only", only Xbox Live friends that are owner invites can join them.
- If they select "Friends Only", then only their friends on Xbox Live can join them.
- If they select "Friends of Friends", then the owner's Xbox Live friends and their Xbox Live friends can join. This is also the default option.

The second option is called "Visible to LAN Players", which allows anyone on the same local network or Wi-Fi network the owner is on to join them, regardless of if they are a friend of theirs or not. There can be a maximum of 5/8 players at a time in a world.

### Java Edition
The disclaimer that appears in Java Edition when clicking onto the Multiplayer section from the main menu.
To enable multiplayer In Java Edition, the world owner has to first pause the game and press "Open to LAN", then the owner is then prompted some options:

- "Game Mode", which sets the gamemode of other players once they join the world for the first time. Once a player rejoins, they retain their previous gamemode even if the gamemode on join was changed.

- "Allow Cheats" (called "Allow Commands" ‌inJava Edition 1.20.5‌[upcoming]), which allows or denies other players access to cheats depending on the selected option. Once a player rejoins, they will not retain their cheats permissions unless enabled again.

Once the world is opened to the LAN, players on the same local network or Wi-Fi network as the world owner can join by going to the multiplayer section. Players who are going to join over Wi-Fi must do the following:

1. Add a server/Use Direct Connect.
2. Enter the IPv4 address of the world owner into the server address, followed by a colon.
3. Enter the port of the world that was given upon opening the world to LAN.
4. Ensure that there are no spaces in the address, then join!

An important thing to note is that a Wi-Fi router Firewall/Computer Firewall can block you from joining/having others join your world. Ensure that no firewalls stop any incoming connections, though beware of the risks.

### Differences from single-player
Once making the world multiplayer, some differences are noticeable, with one being that game mechanisms do not stop working if the player pauses the game. For example, if the player has items being smelted in a furnace, pressing ESC does not stop the smelting process. In Bedrock Edition, there is no difference as opening the menu in singleplayer does not pause the game. 

Gameplay in Minecraft is generally the same in both single-player and multiplayer, with some notable differences. Multiplayer has more of an emphasis on community and collaboration between players, which is assisted by the multiplayer chat function. Multiplayer allows for the player to build contraptions that are intended for multiple players. In addition, there are many adventure maps and mini-games in which multiple players are required.
