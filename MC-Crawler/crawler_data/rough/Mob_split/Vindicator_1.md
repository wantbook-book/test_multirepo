## Behavior
A vindicator captain chasing a Villager.
Vindicators are hostile toward players, iron golems, adult villagers, wandering traders, and snow golems.‌[BE  only]

While idle, a vindicator crosses its arms similar to a villager, with its axe stowed. While giving chase, the vindicator brandishes its axe and sprints. If it has no weapons, a mainhand-unarmed vindicator raises both of its hands when attacking.

On Normal and Hard difficulties, vindicators that are part of a raid can break wooden doors. This is controlled by the raider tag.[1] Like any illager during a raid, vindicators celebrate by cheering if all the villagers are killed or all the beds are destroyed.

In Bedrock Edition, if a pillager arrow accidentally strikes a vindicator, the vindicator retaliates against the pillager, but the pillager does not retaliate. All illagers remain friendly to each other in Java Edition, even when struck accidentally.[2]

### Java Edition
Vindicators are likely to call help from other vindicators when attacked by mobs (except for illagers and goats, or if they were killed in one hit), inciting them all to attack the aggressor. They do not call help from other kinds of illagers.

Vindicator raiders, in addition to breaking doors, can also open doors like villagers.

Ringing a bell gives all vindicators within 32 blocks the Glowing effect for 3 seconds.

### Bedrock Edition
Vindicators can only sprint, even when idle.

A dispenser can equip a vindicator with armor, but it is invisible and does not show on its model.

### Damage
Armed vindicators hit for 7.5 × 3.75 to 19.5 × 9.75 damage, depending on difficulty. They tie with piglin brutes for dealing the forth most melee damage in the game, following the iron golem at 21 × 10.5 damage, the warden at 45 × 22.5 damage and the giant at 75 × 37.5 damage. 

The vindicator's axe attack disables the player's shield for 5 seconds, even when riding a ravager.

### 
A vindicator named Johnny (using a name tag, named spawn egg, etc., or has its Johnny tag set to 1b) is hostile to armor stands‌[BE  only][3], cameras, players in Adventure or Survival mode and all mobs except agents, evokers, ghasts[4], illusioners‌[JE  only], other vindicators, and pillagers. This includes baby villagers‌[BE  only][5], creepers, ravagers‌[JE  only][6], vexes[7], and witches.[8] Vexes or witches do not attack "Johnny" vindicators unless provoked by vindicators.

"Johnny" vindicators also attempt to attack the ender dragon, but she does not take damage.

Most hostile or neutral mobs try to attack the "Johnny" vindicator in return. Exceptions are: 

- mobs that die in one hit (e.g.bees,endermites);
- ender dragonsandphantoms, as those only attack players (however ender dragon deals damage to all mobs that touch it, but that's not considered an attack);
- goats(apart from their usual ramming behavior);
- slimes,magma cubes,ravagers,guardiansandelder guardians.

The Johnny tag overrides its name; the player can give the vindicator any other name and set the Johnny tag to 1b and it remains hostile in the same way as described. Conversely, the player can name the vindicator "Johnny" and set the Johnny tag to 0b, causing the vindicator to act as a normal vindicator.

In Java Edition, using a name tag to rename a "Johnny" vindicator does not reset its Johnny tag, and it continues to exhibit "Johnny" behavior.

In Bedrock Edition, naming a vindicator spawn egg "Johnny" and using it on a monster spawner has no effect; normal vindicators spawn rather than vindicators named "Johnny".
