1. ↑Food Points + Saturation, which gives roughly how long the food can last. See hunger for details.  This value is reduced if the player is near the food or saturation cap, as excess points of either type are wasted.
2. ↑ a b cAverage expected food quality if food poisoning isn't cured. Food poisoning lasts 30 seconds from the last food that inflicted it, and drains nearly 2 shanks of hunger over that duration.  The loss comes from saturation before visible hunger.
3. ↑Food quality if poison isn't cured; healing the damage from poison quickly drains the hunger bar.
