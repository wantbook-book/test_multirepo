## Professions and careers
Each villager has a profession, which can be identified by their clothing. Villagers also have careers specific to their profession. The player can identify a villager's career by reading the title at the top of the trading interface.

Below is a table listing the various villagers, with their careers in relation to their professions, as well as the IDs specifying these. While each profession has a 1 in 6 chance (16.67%) of occurring, the probabilities for individual careers to occur are more diversified. They are listed in the table as well.

When a villager is transformed into a zombie villager, the profession of the zombie villager remains unchanged. However, the career is reset and randomly picked again if the zombie villager is cured, allowing for the player to get a villager with a new career and new trade offers. Old trade offers disappear, even if the same career is chosen again.

### Nitwit
|  | “ | It started because players could summon villagers without a career by using commands: it was the only way to get villagers with green robes. Whenever we discover we have a bug which is used by the community we just see it as 'undefined behaviour' - and 'fix' it by making it a feature. In this case we just needed a profession for the green-robed villager. I don't remember what name we came up with first - I think it was 'unemployed' or something, but it doesn't really fit in the world, because I don't really think the other villagers are employed by anyone either. So I think the next suggestion was 'village idiot' but I thought 'nitwit' was a more fun name. | „ |

|  | “ | Right click on a villager and you can trade with them, offering them emeralds in exchange for better equipment, maps to notable treasures or food. Unless you are trying to trade with a nitwit, of course, in which case you're going to get squat. Who's the nitwit now? | „ |

|  |   | — Marsh Davies[2]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |   |

The trading system is a gameplay mechanic that allows players to trade emeralds for items and vice-versa with villagers. Their trades can be good or bad, depending on what the cost is and what items you might get. Trading is only available for adult villagers; the player cannot trade with baby villagers or the nitwit villager.

Right-clicking a villager allows a player to trade with them, and display their career. Villagers make offers based on their profession and career, and trade based on whatever offers they are making. Different offers may be viewed by pressing the left and right buttons next to the currently displayed offer. All offers involve emerald as a currency, and some item pertinent to the villager's profession and career. Trading allows the acquisition of rare items that would otherwise be fairly difficult to obtain, such as chain armor. The trading mechanic allows players to get bottle o' enchanting in survival mode. When villagers get a new trade, pink particles and green cross particles appear.

After trading a new offer once, the villager allows a new tier of offers. After 2-12 times an offer is repeated, the villager locks the trade offer. That is, the villager no longer offers this trade. When this happens, the player must use another new trade offer in the villager's window once (or several times if it is already used once), and then wait for a short time. If green particles appear, all trades unlock. That is, the villager starts offering all trades. There is a maximum number of tiers each villager can possess, varying by career. Once the villager has unlocked all tiers, it does not open any new ones. However, players can still renew all offers by trading.

### Regeneration
When a villager gives off particles from a new trade, they get 10 seconds of Regeneration I, which gives them 4.

Commands or external editors can help villagers get new trades. 

If a villager unintentionally picks up certain seeds or crops, it throws it to another villager to simulate trading between the villagers.
