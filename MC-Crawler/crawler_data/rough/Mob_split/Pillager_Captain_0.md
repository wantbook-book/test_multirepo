## Spawning
Raid captains spawn in the same conditions and occurrences of any illager, with no special occasions having one spawn, and one spawning being completely randomized. In Bedrock Edition, a pillager raid captain can be spawned using the /summon pillager ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_as_illager_captain command, and a vindicator raid captain can be spawned using /summon vindicator ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_as_illager_captain command. 

Additionally, in Java Edition, monster spawners containing a pillager spawn egg have a small chance of producing a raid captain.

### Patrols
Main article: Patrol
One pillager raid captain always spawns as part of a patrol.

### Raids
Main article: Raid
As part of raids in Java Edition, a raid captain spawns as a part of a group of pillagers, and sometimes spawns riding a ravager. The captain does not cause another raid if killed, but when its banner drops, other illagers rush to grab it.
In Bedrock Edition, raid captains are unused and do not spawn naturally during raids, but the code for them is present.[verify]

### Pillager outposts
Main article: Pillager Outpost § Spawning
Usually, 1–3 pillager raid captains also spawn in a pillager outpost.

In Java Edition, only pillagers and passive mobs may spawn within a pillager outpost spawn area.  Pillagers may spawn on any valid opaque block as long as the block light level is 8 or lower.

## Drops
### General
Upon death, any raid captain can drop:

- 1Ominous banner, unaffected byLootingand is always dropped.
- 1Ominous Bottle‌[upcoming: JE 1.21]

#### Pillager
- 0–2arrows, dropping more with the presence ofLooting, up to 5‌[Bedrock Edition  only].
- Itscrossbow(may be loaded or unloaded), which has an 8.5% chance to be dropped (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III). It has a random durability and may be enchanted.

#### Vindicator
- 0–1emeralds, with the maximum increasing by 1 for every level ofLooting.
