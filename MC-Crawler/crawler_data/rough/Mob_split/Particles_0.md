## Behavior
Particles are rendered as front-facing 2D sprites, meaning they always face the player. They disappear after a short animation, in which they may change sizes and rotate, and cycle between a number of animation sprites.

Some particles, like angry villager particle, do not have collision, and usually phase through blocks and entities, but particles like campfire smoke particles do collide with solid blocks and are slowed by cobwebs, but are unaffected by other entities.

The /particle command can be used to create particles.

If a player uses the "minimal" particles option in the video settings, some particles may not appear.
