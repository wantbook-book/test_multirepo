### Mobs
The End is home to three naturally occurring mobs:

- Endermenspawn naturally throughout the entire dimension.
- Theender dragonspawns naturally on the central island when the player first arrives, but can be respawned by placing 4end crystals, one on each side's middle block of theexit portal.
- Shulkersappear withinend citieson the outer islands. They do not respawn once killed, but can sometimes clone themselves when attacked by another shulker.

Other mobs except for the wither may be sent into the End through an end portal. (The wither can still be built in the End as usual.)
