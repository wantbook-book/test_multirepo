## Events
### Community Pre-Show
There was a 20-minute Community Pre-Show right before the main event which consisted of content creators expressing about Minecraft.

### Update announcement
Like MINECON Live 2019, there was an announcement relating to the next major update, similarly to how the Nether Update was announced at MINECON Live 2019, with other major updates in the years before. Unlike the last years though, the announcement was held at the beginning of the show. The update that was announced was Caves & Cliffs.

Mobs from Minecraft Dungeons and Minecraft Earth were voted on to be added to Minecraft. For the second time, watchers were able to vote for a new mob to be added into the game in a future update. The first time this happened was in MINECON Earth 2017. 

Each mob received its own video justifying its inclusion.

The mobs that were on the vote were the Moobloom, Iceologer, and the Glow Squid.[2]

- Mooblooms would spawn inFlower Forests and would interact with bees in some way.Buttercups would also be added.[3]
- Iceologers would spawn inMountainsand hurl ice clouds at the player.
- Glow Squids would spawn in theOceanin dark areas, illuminating them. Their texture would glow like anEnderman's eyes, but not actually emit light.

The mobs that lost the mob vote are shelved indefinitely, and may or may not be added in the future.[4]

#### Results

Voting took place in two rounds. The losing mob, the Moobloom, was eliminated from consideration in the second round. The winner of the the second and final round was the Glow Squid.
