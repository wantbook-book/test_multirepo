#### Night vision
If the camera is not in water, and the entity has no darkness effect, night vision makes the color brighter.

#### Nether and ender dragon
If the entity has no blindness or darkness, in a dimension with the nether effect, or a dimension where there's an ender dragon boss event, the sight distance in the distance fog (not water, lava, powder snow fog) is half of the rendering distance, and the maximum sight distance is 96 blocks. The shape becomes a sphere.

### Removed
#### Void fog

  

This section describes content that exists only in outdated versions of Java Edition.Â 
This feature used to be in the game but has since been removed.



In prior versions of Java Edition (specifically Beta 1.8 Pre-release through 14w34b inclusive, up to its removal in 14w34c), a thick black fog was introduced. As the player descended below Y=26, this fog would start to appear. As the player traveled deeper, the fog at the edge of the render distance would become closer until the player reached the first layers of bedrock, where visibility was reduced to just a few blocks, beyond which was complete darkness. The gray void particles started appearing below Y=7, as well as in the void.

The existence of this fog depended on a lack of sky lighting. If vent holes were opened up to allow skylight to enter an otherwise secluded underground space, void fog would no longer be present, so long as the player kept near this skylight source.

Void fog was removed late into 1.8's development for performance reasons and general community distaste.[1]

- A player's view limit would decrease with depth.


## Bedrock Edition
In Bedrock Edition, fogs has six types used in six different circumstances:

- air: When the camera is in air
- water: When the camera is in water
- lava: When the camera is in lava, and the player has nofire resistance
- lava resistance: When the camera is in lava, and the player hasfire resistance
- weather: When in air and it's raining
- powder snow: When the camera is in powder snow

In a fog setting file in a resource pack, one or more of above types can be specified. Active fog settings are determined from three aspects:

- Custom fog stack (from/fogcommand)
- Fog settings for the current biome
- Default fog setting

Whenever the game needs to get the current fog, it checks the fog settings from these three aspects from the top (the newest fog setting in the fog stack from the command) to the bottom (default fog setting) in order, until it finds a fog definition for the current fog type. If it finds no matching setting, the game uses the hardcoded default setting of the Bedrock Engine.

In other words, this is equivalent to that all fog settings from the three aspects are applied one by one from the bottom (default fog setting) to the top (the newest fog setting in the fog stack from the command) in order. The fogs in a fog setting applied later overrides that of earlier fog settings. Each fog type works independently. Hardcoded default setting of the game engine is applied before settings from these three aspects.
