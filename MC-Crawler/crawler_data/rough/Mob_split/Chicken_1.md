### Breeding
Main article: Breeding
If two adult chickens are fed wheat seeds, beetroot seeds, melon seeds, pumpkin seeds, torchflower seeds, or pitcher pods, a baby chicken spawns. They cannot breed for 5 minutes afterward.

Chicks take 20 minutes to grow up, but the growth time can be accelerated by 10% each time it is fed seeds. A baby chick fed a seed once per second grows up in approximately 48 seconds using 47 seeds.

Chicks are smaller than a half-block and can unwillingly pass through openings smaller than a full block, but do not walk through half-block-tall spaces. A chick riding a minecart cannot be hit because it is completely inside the minecart's hitbox.

### Eggs
See also: Tutorials/Egg farming § chicken farm

Chickens are the only Overworld mob that can repopulate without breeding. Adult chickens lay eggs at random and an egg thrown at the ground by a player or a dispenser has a 1⁄8 chance of spawning a baby chicken. If a baby chicken spawns from a thrown egg, there is a further 1⁄32 chance to spawn three extra baby chickens, or 1⁄256 overall. It is theoretically possible for a stack of 16 eggs to yield 64 chickens if all spawn chances succeed for all eggs.

If the player throws an egg at a glass pane, the baby chicken can spawn on the far side of the pane.

	- Tags common to all mobs
	- EggLayTime: Number of ticks until the chicken lays its egg. Laying occurs at 0 and this timer gets reset to a new random value between 6000 and 12000.
	- IsChickenJockey: 1 or 0 (true/false) - Whether or not the chicken is a jockey for a baby zombie. If true, the chicken can naturally despawn, drops 10 experience upon death instead of 1-3 and cannot lay eggs. Baby zombies can still control a ridden chicken even if this is set false.
