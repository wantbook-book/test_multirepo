## World settings

The difficulty button in the options menu.
There are four difficulty levels in the game: Peaceful, Easy, Normal and Hard. These can be changed when creating a world, in the settings, as well as with the /difficulty command.

While the difficulty settings modify the challenge in Survival mode, they also affect hostile mobs in Creative mode the same as in Survival; for example:

- Hostile mobs cannot spawn naturally in Creative Peaceful.
- Zombieshave the same difficulty-dependent chances as in Survival to convert villagers intozombie villagers(0% in Creative Easy, 50% in Creative Normal, 100% in Creative Hard).
- Hostile mobs killed bymob grindersin farms drop higher-value items in Creative Hard.

Survival mode is affected by difficulty as described in the sections below. 

### Peaceful
No hostile mobs can spawn naturally, except for shulkers, hoglins, piglins, piglin brutes‌[BE  only], and the ender dragon. No spiders, cave spiders, zombified piglins, endermen or drowned – neutral rather than hostile mobs – can spawn naturally. When any of these mobs attempt to spawn (whether naturally, through monster spawners, spawn eggs, or commands), they are removed from the game instantaneously. Skeleton horses are also not able to spawn naturally.[1] All mobs that can spawn (such as shulkers, piglins, or wolves) are completely peaceful and unable to harm the player - with the exception of the ender dragon. When the difficulty is switched from any other setting to Peaceful, all mobs that are not allowed to spawn on Peaceful are removed from the world. Players regain health rapidly over time. Despite this, it is still possible to die if damage is received quickly enough. TNT deals no direct damage to the player, but it does give knockback still, meaning a player can be killed by it if it launches them too far upward. The hunger bar never depletes; in Java Edition, players therefore cannot eat anything except golden apples, chorus fruits, milk buckets, honey bottles and suspicious stew, unless the player switched to Peaceful when their hunger bar was below the maximum. Players can eat normally in Bedrock Edition. Additionally, if the hunger bar is below the maximum, it regenerates quickly.

Because of the gameplay changes and the absence of many mob types, many blocks and items are unavailable to the player. A list can be found at Non-renewable_resource#Peaceful_difficulty. In addition, the player is unable to get many advancements and achievements. 

One major effect of the lack of certain resources is that end portals cannot be activated by the player in Peaceful difficulty, because it is impossible to acquire the eyes of ender necessary to activate an end portal.[note 1] However, it is possible for an end portal to be activated by naturally generating with an eye of ender already embedded within all 12 end portal frames. For any given end portal, there is a 1 in a trillion chance of this happening.[note 2]
However, because of the huge number of possible seeds, over 8 million seeds are known to generate such end portals.

### Easy
Hostile mobs spawn, but they deal 1⁄2 of the damage they would on Normal difficulty plus 1. The hunger bar can deplete, damaging the player until 10 remain if it drains completely. Cave spiders and bees cannot poison players on Easy difficulty, and the wither does not cause the Wither effect, although wither skeletons do. Lightning sets only the struck block on fire, not surrounding blocks. Zombies do not break down doors, and do not turn villagers into zombie villagers. Zombies and skeletons don't wear full sets of armor. Hostile mobs like zombies, skeletons, spiders, husks and strays deal about 1 or 2 damage.

### Normal
Hostile mobs spawn and deal standard damage. The hunger bar can deplete, damaging the player until 1 remains if it drains completely. Zombies do not break down doors, but villagers killed by zombies have a 50% chance of turning into zombie villagers. Zombies and skeletons rarely wear sets of enchanted armor. Vindicators can break doors.

### Hard
Hostile mobs deal approximately 11⁄2 times the damage they would deal on Normal difficulty, and in some cases drop higher-value items when killed. The hunger bar can deplete, not only damaging but also killing the player if it drains completely. Zombies can break through wooden doors and can spawn reinforcements when attacked. In Java Edition, spiders can spawn with a beneficial status effect (Speed, Strength, Regeneration, or Invisibility), with these effects having an infinite duration. Villagers killed by zombies always turn into zombie villagers. Pillagers spawn near the player, with their attacks dealing 4 damage. In Bedrock Edition, if the world type is infinite, they deal 5 damage.

### Hardcore mode

  

This feature is exclusive to  Java Edition. 



  

This article describes content that may be included in Bedrock Edition. 
This content has appeared in Bedrock Edition 1.21.0 development versions, but the full update containing it has not been released yet.


- Icon for Java Edition Hardcore mode.

Main article: Hardcore
In Java Edition, at the world creation screen, selecting Hardcore from among the game mode options causes the player to spawn in Hard difficulty, does not allow it to be changed, and allows the player only one life. In a single player world, a player who dies can choose to respawn in Spectator mode or return to the title screen. In multiplayer, upon death, the player's game mode is automatically set to Spectator mode.

The only way to change the difficulty of Hardcore is to use the Open to LAN feature in the pause menu to enable commands, or to use an .NBT editor on the world's .NBT file.

This difficulty is currently not available in Realms.

It is available in Bedrock Edition from version 1.21.0 and onward.
