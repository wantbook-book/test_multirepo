# Mob
A mob (short for mobile, mobile entity, or mobile object)[1] is an AI-driven game entity. All mobs can be attacked and hurt (from falling, attacked by a player or another mob, falling into the void, hit by an arrow, etc), and have some form of voluntary movement. Different types of mobs often have unique AI and loot.

## Spawning
Main article: Spawn cycle
Different mobs spawn in diverse habitats, depending on the light level, biome, and surface material.

Mobs spawn in various ways. Most mobs spawn naturally, depending on the light level, biome, and their surroundings. For example, most animals are found in bright areas on the surface, while hostile monsters are commonly found in the dark (whether it's a cave, dungeon, mansion, or at night). Animals usually spawn upon chunk generation, while hostile monsters spawn and despawn in a certain radius around the player. Some mobs, including passive and neutral animals, and even hoglins have the ability to be bred by the player, creating offspring. Villagers also breed randomly depending on the time of day and the number of beds (though they can’t be directly bred by the player). Most mobs never spawn on transparent blocks, in water (except fish, dolphins, turtles, and other aquatic creatures), in lava (except for striders), on bedrock, or on blocks less than a full block tall (such as slabs placed on the bottom half). The exception is monster spawners, from which monsters can spawn naturally on any block including air. A rare occurrence of spawning are the jockey mobs, which is a mob riding another mob, spider/chicken jockeys and the skeleton horsemen are one of the few jockeys found in the Overworld.

Some mobs (like the snow golem and the wither) require that the player "construct" them before being able to spawn. The iron golem can spawn naturally and can also be constructed. The ender dragon can be respawned with four end crystals.

Players can also spawn mobs easily by using a spawn eggs in Creative mode, or the /summon command.

### Despawning
Main article: Spawn § Despawning
Many mobs despawn (cease to exist) after a certain amount of time if far enough from the player. In Java Edition, most passive mobs do not despawn, while most monsters do. In Bedrock Edition, almost all mobs despawn.

## Behavior

Mobs are affected by the environment in the same ways as the player; they are subject to physics, and they can be hurt by the same things that harm the player (catching on fire, falling, drowning, attacks from weapons, the /kill command, etc.). Some mobs may be resistant or immune to certain hazards, such as some Nether mobs, which are immune to fire. All aquatic mobs except dolphins are immune to drowning. Mobs can ride minecarts and other mobs can climb up ladders. When mobs are killed, they turn to dust and drop items that may be useful resources. Each type of mob in Minecraft has a certain AI (artificial intelligence) system with different behaviors and mechanics. Mobs ordinarily wander around at random if there is a player within 32 blocks and usually avoid walking off blocks high enough to cause falling damage. Many mobs have an advanced path-finding system that allows them to navigate through obstacles to get to a desired object or destination. Passive mobs flee in random directions after being hurt, while hostile mobs face and chase/attack the player as soon as the player comes close. Neutral mobs remain neutral until a player or mob provokes it (usually by attacking), at which point the neutral mob becomes hostile toward and attacks the entity that hit it. Most mobs are aware of players within (a Euclidian distance) 16 blocks of them, but some can see farther. Conversely, most mobs can be heard by players up to 16 blocks away. Mobs are harmless to players in Creative mode.

Most mobs cannot see through most solid blocks, including semi-transparent blocks such as ice, glass, tall grass, or glass panes. In Java Edition, all mobs (except for wardens[2]) do not try to avoid walking over rails tracks unless pushed onto the rails by other mobs.


## List of mobs
Mobs are listed and classified by their nature from the player's perspective. For more details on a particular mob, click on them to view their individual page.

### Passive mobs
Passive mobs are harmless mobs (except for the pufferfish and villagers) that do not attempt to attack the player, even when provoked or attacked, though some of them may attack other mobs. Most of them can be bred or tamed.
