## Behavior
A phantom swooping at the player. In addition, a spider is stalking the player and sheep can be seen in the background.
When idle, phantoms fly around in a roughly circular pattern within 15 to 25 blocks of a player horizontally and within 24 to 35 blocks of a player vertically. They leave a trail of gray smoke while they fly. Their movement speed is one of the fastest of any mob, up to 20 blocks per second. They have a large search radius, targeting and following players from 64 blocks away. Once every 10-20 seconds‌[BE  only] or every 8-12 seconds‌[JE  only] they swoop down or up quickly to attack. If stopped or hurt during this action, the phantom retreats back to its original elevation. When a path to its original elevation is obstructed by a block, the phantom continues attempting to return to its original elevation until it either attacks or moves out from under the block. Phantoms do not attack an exposed player sleeping in a bed. 

Phantoms can move through water at their normal speed. In Bedrock Edition, a phantom underwater attempts to fly to the surface, and dies from drowning after 20 seconds if trapped underwater. Phantoms do not drown in Java Edition.

A phantom's body disappears when under the Invisibility effect, but its eyes and smoke particles are still visible.

Cats hiss at phantoms that are currently attacking players, and phantoms try to stay at least 16 blocks away from them. In Bedrock Edition, phantoms also avoid ocelots in the same manner.

Being an undead mob, they are: 

- damaged by the status effectInstant Healthand healed by the status effectInstant Damage.
- unaffected by the status effectsRegenerationandPoison.
- ignored by thewither.
- affected by theSmiteenchantment.
- unable to swim inwater, but do not drown‌[JE  only].
- a threat toarmadillos, causing them to hide in their shell.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80]

Like zombies and skeletons, phantoms burn in sunlight. They burn even when equipped with helmets through commands.[5]
