### Moon phases
Each day that progresses adds 24000 ticks to the time counter. While each day looks the same, the Moon appears in one of eight different phases each night. Although there is no explicit command to change the Moon's phase, using /time add 24000 advances the Moon to its next phase. Furthermore, any of the phases can be accessed with the use of one of the following commands:

- /time set 14000– Full moon
- /time set 38000– Waning gibbous
- /time set 62000– Third quarter
- /time set 86000– Waning crescent
- /time set 110000– New moon
- /time set 134000– Waxing crescent
- /time set 158000– First quarter
- /time set 182000– Waxing gibbous
