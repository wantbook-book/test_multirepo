An arrow cannot be picked up by a player in Survival or Adventure mode if: 

- It is shot by a player inCreativemode.
- It is shot by anymobable to shoot arrows, such asskeletons,strays,pillagers, orpiglins. This includes mobs that do not shoot arrows in normal gameplay, such asillusionersand bow-wieldingwither skeletons.
	- This is the case even in Creative mode.[1]
- It is shot with anInfinity-enchantedbow.
- It is one of the two extra arrows shot with aMultishot-enchantedcrossbow.

Arrows that are stuck in a player cannot be retrieved, and the player does not drop them when killed.
