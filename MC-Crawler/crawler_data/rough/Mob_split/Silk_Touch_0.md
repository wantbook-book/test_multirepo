# Silk Touch
Silk Touch is a tool enchantment that causes certain blocks to drop themselves as items instead of their usual drops, or lack thereof, when mined. For example, mining a stone block using a pickaxe without Silk Touch would drop cobblestone, however, when using a pickaxe with Silk Touch, the stone block itself drops. See the table below.

## Obtaining
Silk Touch can be obtained from enchantment tables, drops from mobs that have spawned in a raid,‌[Bedrock Edition  only] books obtained by fishing, monster room chests, librarian villagers, and non-village structure loot.

## Obtainable blocks
The table below lists blocks that do not normally drop themselves as items:
