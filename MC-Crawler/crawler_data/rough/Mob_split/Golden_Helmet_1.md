#### Repair
Helmets may be repaired by using them along with some gold ingots in an anvil. They may also be repaired by crafting them together with another golden helmet.

### Enchantments
A helmet can receive the following enchantments. Note that while iron and chainmail have the same durability, chainmail has a higher enchantability than iron or diamond.

### Armor trimming
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a smithing template, a golden helmet, and an ingot or crystal (iron ingot, copper ingot, gold ingot, netherite ingot, emerald, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, amethyst shard, nether quartz, or diamond).


These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.

### Piglins
Piglins are attracted to golden helmets and pick them up, examining them for 6 to 8 seconds. Piglins can wear other helmets but are not attracted to them. They prefer stronger helmets over weaker helmets, with one exception: They always prefer golden helmets, throwing out stronger helmets in favor of gold helmets. Enchanted helmets are preferred over unenchanted helmets.
