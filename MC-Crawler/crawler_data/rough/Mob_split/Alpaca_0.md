## Spawning
A llama spawns at a light level 7 or above on grass blocks in savanna plateau, savanna‌[BE  only][1] or windswept savanna‌[BE  only] biomes in herds of 4 llamas, and in windswept hills, windswept forest, and windswept gravelly hills biomes in herds of 4 to 6 llamas, coming in four coat colors: brown, cream, white or gray.

10% of llamas spawn as baby llamas.

Every wandering trader spawns with two leashed trader llamas. Trader llamas often despawn one tick before their trader does, because a trader llama has its DespawnDelay set to 47999 ticks. This value is decremented each tick that the llama is untamed, unleashed, and not being ridden by a player, and is reset to one tick less than the trader's own DespawnDelay if leashed to a trader. The llama despawns when the its DespawnDelay reaches zero ticks.

## Drops
### Breeding
1–7 upon successful breeding.

Like other baby animals, killing a baby llama yields no item or experience.

## Behavior
Llamas are neutral, but they retaliate when attacked by a player or mob. Sometimes their spit can miss their target and hit another llama, starting a fight within a group of llamas. Additionally, a wandering trader's llamas spit at mobs or players who attack the wandering trader.

Llamas are hostile toward wolves and spit without provocation, but they don't attack tamed wolves unless provoked. Wolves are fearful of llamas of strength 4 or 5 and always run away.[2] Wolves flee from weaker llamas less often.

Trader llamas are hostile toward wolves, and defend their wandering trader from illagers‌[Java Edition  only] and all zombie variants. 

Llamas and trader llamas are completely passive in Peaceful difficulty.

The llama floats when in water deeper than two blocks.

### Spitting


Main article: Llama spit
Llamas attack other mobs by spitting at them, dealing 1 damage.

### Taming
Llamas can be tamed by repetitively riding them until hearts are displayed, done by pressing use on the llama while holding nothing.

Taming success depends on the llama's Temper value. Temper is a positive trait, with higher values increasing the chance of successful taming. Llamas begin with a Temper value of 0 and a maximum of 30. When a player rides an untamed llama, a random number from 0 to 29 is chosen. The llama gets tamed successfully if this number is less than the Temper value, otherwise, the Temper is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off. Temper can also be increased by feeding the llama.

Naturally spawned trader llamas are untamed and cannot be ridden while being led by their wandering trader. If unleashed, they become tameable in Java Edition, or immediately tamed in Bedrock Edition. Tamed trader llamas do not despawn.

Tamed llamas do not spit at mobs that attack its owner, although it spits at any mob that attacks the llama. Tamed llamas can still retaliate at players should the player hit them.

Feeding a llama food can alter its behavior, increasing its temper value if untamed, restoring lost health or making a baby grow faster (babies ordinarily take around 20 minutes to mature to adults). The table below lists the effects of the 2 food items llamas accept.

A llama can be fed by holding a valid food item and pressing use while facing the llama. Llamas can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals. If the food is invalid, the player mounts the llama instead.

### Breeding
Adult tamed llamas can be bred by being fed a hay bale. The baby llama takes on the coat color of one parent at random. Its strength is chosen as a random integer between 1 and the strength of the stronger parent, inclusive. 3% of the time the resulting strength is increased by 1, but it is capped at 5.

When two trader llamas are bred, the offspring wears a rug.

| Stronger parent's strength | Offspring's strength |        |        |     |       |
|----------------------------|----------------------|--------|--------|-----|-------|

Select a row based on the stronger parent. The column shows the probability of the resulting offspring having a given strength.  

A llama's base health (15 × 7.5 to 30 × 15) is calculated based on that of its parents, in the same way as a horse's.
