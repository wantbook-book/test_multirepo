#### Cluster spawning
Cluster spawning happens in two stages: first attempt to spawn surface mobs, then attempt to spawn cave mobs. Before spawning, the population control cap is calculated based on the 9 chunk x 9 chunk square area surrounding the current chunk. Spawning begins by picking a random X and Z location within the chunk currently being evaluated. The Y coordinate is determined by starting at the world height and searching downward for a solid-top-surface block with a non-spawn-blocking block above it. The first such block that is found is considered to be the surface, and the algorithm attempts to spawn a surface mob herd. However, if the algorithm finds a solid block before finding a spawnable solid-top-block (e.g. if it finds a tree trunk directly under leaves), it does not make any surface spawn attempt. The algorithm then continues to search downward for the next suitable block with a non-spawn-blocking block above it. When a block meeting the criteria is found, the algorithm attempts to spawn a cave mob herd at that block location. Cave spawn attempts continue until the Y coordinate reaches the world bottom, and do not stop even if a cave herd was spawned.

Surface and cave cluster spawn attempts then go through the following steps to figure out what mob to spawn and how many:

1. Picks a random mob.
	- If the current spawn location is in a liquid, pick a random water mob.
	- If the light level is 7 or higher, there are no other blocks above the current location, and the current location is a grass block, pick a random animal mob.
	- Otherwise, spawn a monster mob.
2. Picks a random number of mobs to spawn in the herd. Each mob can have its own min and max herd size, and the herd size can depend on difficulty and biome.
3. Make sure the spawn location has suitablespawn conditions.
4. Limit the number of mobs spawning based on the global mob cap. No mobs spawn if the mob count already meets or exceeds the mob cap.
5. For each mob to spawn, check that spawning it would not exceed the population control cap or mob density cap.
	- If spawning the mob would not exceed the population control or mob density caps, then the probability of a mob spawning can be calculated using the formula:(mob density cap - current mob density count) / mob density cap
6. Finally, attempt to spawn the mob in the world.
	- Spawning the mob can fail; for example, if spawning it would cause it to spawn inside of a block or part of a wall.

#### Structure spawning
Structure spawn attempts occur at specific relative X and Z coordinates in naturally generated structures, known as "hard-coded spawn spots". The structures that have hard-coded spawn spots include swamp huts, ocean monuments, pillager outposts, and nether fortresses. Whenever a successful cluster spawn attempt occurs within a chunk that contains a hard-coded spawn spot, the environmental spawning algorithm also attempts a structure spawn. (Note that a "successful attempt" here means that a spawnable block was found, even if the spawn was then blocked by light level check or mob cap check.) The structure spawn attempt follows the same rules and steps described above for cluster spawning, with the following changes:

- Instead of starting at world height and searching down to bedrock at the specific X and Z location, the search begins and ends at a specific Y values determined by the type of structure. Structure spawn attempts occur only on the first spawnable block found (i.e. the highest spawnable block) within that range.
- The mob picked depends on the structure: swamp huts spawn witches, ocean monuments spawn guardians, pillager outposts spawn pillagers (including patrol captains), and nether fortresses spawn skeletons, wither skeletons, blazes, and magma cubes.
- The population control caps are effectively 1 higher for structure spawn attempts.

## Other types of spawning
### General
- InCreativeor via a dispenser, the player can usespawn eggsto spawn most mobs. When mobs are spawned this way, all normal spawning requirements, such as light level and block type, are ignored (though monsters other than shulkers and the ender dragon still cannot be spawned in peaceful).
- Anyentitycan be spawned using the/summoncommand.
