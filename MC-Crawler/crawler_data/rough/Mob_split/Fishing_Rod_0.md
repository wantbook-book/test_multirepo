## Obtaining
### Mob loot
In Java Edition, the drowned mob has a 3.75% chance of spawning with a fishing rod equipped.
In Bedrock Edition, naturally-spawned drowned has 0.85% chance to spawn with fishing rod, while converted drowned has 1% chance to spawn with it.
If killed, they have an 8.5% chance of dropping this fishing rod. That chance increases by 1% for each level of Looting applied to a weapon (up to 11.5% chance). The dropped item is damaged and never enchanted.

#### Unit repair
Main article: Anvil mechanics § Unit repair
Repair & NameDamaged Fishing Rod
A fishing rod can be combined with another fishing rod in an anvil, preserving the enchantments of both.

### Fishing
Enchanted fishing rods can be obtained as "treasure" items from fishing, and unenchanted ones as "junk" items.

### Trading
Journeyman-level fisherman villagers sell enchanted fishing rods for 6 emeralds.
The enchantments are the same as the ones obtained from an enchantment table at levels 5–19.

### 
If a carrot on a stick or a warped fungus on a stick is used to the point of zero durability, it becomes a fishing rod again.

## Usage
### Fishing
Main article: Fishing
Fishing rods can be cast into water. After a short period of time, a stream of bubble particles approaches the fishing rod. If the rod is reeled in once the particles "bite" the bobber, the player obtains a fish, junk, or possibly a treasure item. If the fishing rod was in the player's hand and is no longer, the fishing bobber entity despawns, unless the fishing rod to the off-hand or it has been swapped with another fishing rod.[citation needed]
