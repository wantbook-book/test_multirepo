# Potion
Potions are bottled substances designed to inflict effects. They are created by brewing and, when drunk, give the player an effect for a certain amount of time. All potions are brewed from a water bottle, which is considered a type of potion but has no effects.

## Obtaining
### Mob loot
Witches can drop potions of Healing, Fire Resistance, Swiftness, or Water Breathing if they die while drinking that potion.

A wandering trader can drop a potion of Invisibility if killed while drinking the potion.

### Chest loot
Two Instant Health II potions can be found in the brewing stand on end ships in end cities, and one splash potion of Weakness can be found in a brewing stand in igloo basements.

In Bedrock Edition, the cauldron in a swamp hut contains a random potion. There is a 25% chance for Healing or Poison, 15% for Swiftness, 10% for Slowness, Weakness, Strength or Water Breathing, and 5% for Fire Resistance.

### Brewing
Main article: Brewing
Almost all potions are obtained by brewing.

The potion of Luck‌[JE  only] and the potion of Decay‌[BE  only] cannot be brewed. They can be obtained via commands, and are also available in the Creative inventory in their respective versions.

### Bartering
Piglins may barter a potion or a splash potion of Fire Resistance when given a gold ingot.

### Fishing
Water bottles can be fished up as junk items.

## Usage
Potions are used by pressing and holding use with the potion bottle in hand, as with all consumable items. When consumed, they bestow the corresponding status effect upon the player and return a glass bottle.

Drinking a potion while already under the effects of the same potion does not add onto the effect's duration, but simply resets it. A potion effect does not "downgrade" if a lower level is activated. For example, if a player has Regeneration II, drinking a regular potion of Regeneration does not have any effect.

Potions can only be put into cauldrons in Bedrock Edition.

### Modifiers
Main article: Brewing
Potions can be modified in five ways. 

1. Brewingglowstone dustinto certain potions enhances their level of effect.
2. Addingredstoneextends the duration of the effect.
3. Brewinggunpowderinto a potion makes it into a splash potion (area effect).
4. Addingdragon's breathto a splash potion creates alingering potion(area effect that lingers on the ground).
5. Brewing afermented spider eyeinto specific potions modifies their effect, usually inverting it, which is referred to as "corruption".

The modifications of enhancement and extension are mutually exclusive.

Enhancing most potions trades some of its duration for a bigger effect. For example, the base Regeneration works for 44 seconds whereas Regeneration II lasts for only 22 seconds but heals more per tick during that time.

Extending a potion generally makes it last 8⁄3 as long as its base potion, so a duration of 3 minutes becomes 8 minutes.

#### Corruption
The usual result of corruption is to invert the potion's effect (for example Swiftness becomes Slowness). Interestingly, corrupting Poison (continuous damage effect) creates a Potion of Harming, an instant damage effect, instead of the continuous healing effect (regeneration) one would normally expect. Corrupting a Potion of Night Vision turns it into a Potion of Invisibility rather than an inverse effect that might be something like Blindness.

Corrupting an extended or enhanced potion results in a corrupted potion with the same modifier, if it is supported by the corrupted effect. All of the "corrupted" potions except Harming can be extended, but it is the only one that can be enhanced. In Bedrock Edition, the corruption of Healing II or Poison II potions results in a potion of Harming I.
