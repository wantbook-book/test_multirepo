## Causes
| Cause                 | Potency | Length      | Notes                                                       |
|-----------------------|---------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Beaconset to Haste    | I       | 0:05 – 0:17 | Replenishes when in range.                                  |
| Beaconset to Haste II | II      | 0:17        | Replenishes when in range. Requires beacon pyramid level 4. |

## Immune mobs
All mobs are immune to Haste. Most mobs are unaffected by Haste as they cannot mine blocks.

## Interaction with Mining Fatigue
Mining Fatigue III inflicted by elder guardians prevents the player from instant mining most blocks regardless of the Haste effect, along with a huge decrease of mining speed. However, lower levels of Mining Fatigue can be overcome by Haste of level III or greater, with a resultant reduced Haste effect.

## Notes
- At levels 3 until 127 (Java EditionorBedrock Edition) or 255 (Pocket Edition), theplayer's arm does not move while mining.
- Haste decreases the charging time ofsweep attack.‌[Java Edition  only]
- An alternative method of increasing mining speed is theEfficiencyenchantment. Its effects stack with Haste.
