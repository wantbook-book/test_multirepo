## Effect
Levitation causes the affected entity to float upward at a rate of 0.9×level blocks per second[verify]. This does not affect swimming or flying.

In Java Edition, negative levels cause the entity to float downward, overriding the usual falling due to gravity. Level 0 (amplifier 255) makes falling, jumping, and ascending stairs impossible for the player (other entities still float), and taking damage at this level causes the player to rise rapidly into the air.

An affected entity does not take fall damage until the effect wears off, after which the entity falls and takes damage as usual from falling. 

Levitation has no effect on players riding entities. It also has no effect on entities that are in water or lava.‌[Java Edition  only][1][2]

|---------|---------|--------|-------------------------------|--|---------|----|------|-----------------------------------|
| Shulker | I       | 0:10   | 9 blocks‌[Java Edition  only] |  | Shulker | II | 0:10 | 18 blocks‌[Bedrock Edition  only] |

## Immune mobs
Only boss mobs are immune to the effect. While shulkers and flying mobs can have Levitation, they are not affected. Blazes can be affected by Levitation when not hovering.

## Notes
Mobs tied with balloons‌[ Minecraft Education and Bedrock Edition  only] exhibit behavior similar to if they had a high level of Levitation. However, this mechanic does not use the Levitation effect.

In Bedrock Edition, blocking a shulker projectile with a shield still gives the player Levitation. It is unknown if this is a glitch.

If a player is given a Levitation level over 127, they instead fall down at a fast or slow rate, depending on the value.‌[Java Edition  only]

If a player is given Levitation 255, they hover on their current Y level, being unable to move up or down.‌[Java Edition  only]
