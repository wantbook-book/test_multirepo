# Toxifin Slab
A toxifin slab, also known as simply toxifin, is a modified version of the guardian with an orange body and green spikes. It has the same width and length, but half the height as a guardian. 

Their spawn egg has the name "Toxifin Slab Spawn Egg", however, the entity id is simply "toxifin", which can be seen on the targeted entity line of the F3 display.

## Spawning
Toxifin slabs spawn naturally in the Potato dimension. They frequently spawn in the wasteland biome, as well as inside of a colosseum. Each colosseum spawns a large number of toxifins upon generation, and there are four monster spawners under the central plaftorm, which also spawn toxifins. Even after destroying spawners and killing all initially generated toxifins, more of them still seem to spawn in the structure, although not very frequently.[more information needed]

## Behavior
Toxifins will wander aimlessly when no enemies are around. They can either swim in water, or jump around on land. When nearby other toxifins, they may stack on top of each other. Stacking can occur multiple times. They may dismount each other naturally, and always dismount upon taking damage. They can also dismount boats and minecarts in the same way.

Toxifins attack by sending out a beam directed at their target. The beam constantly inflicts Poison for 1 second until charged, when it adds Wither for 2 seconds.

In addition to attacking players, toxifins also attack squid, glow squid and axolotls. Snow golems, iron golems and axolotls attack toxifins. Toxifins don't get angry at entities that attack them, this includes players and axolotls if they are distracted by another entity.

When a toxifin takes melee damage from another entity, it inflicts 2 seconds of Wither. This also applies to players in Creative.
