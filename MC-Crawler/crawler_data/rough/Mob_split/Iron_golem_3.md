### Cracking
Iron golems have different stages of being cracked to show their health. When their health is above 74 × 37, they do not have any cracks. When their health is between 50 × 25 and 74 × 37, some cracks appear. When their health is between 25 × 12.5 and 49 × 24.5, they appear more cracked. When their health is lower than 25 × 12.5, many cracks are visible.

- No deterioration  More than 75% of health remaining
- Low deterioration  More than 50% but no more than 75% of health remaining
- Average deterioration  More than 25% but no more than 50% of health remaining
- Strong deterioration  No more than 25% of health remaining

### Healing
Using an iron ingot on an iron golem restores its health by 25 × 12.5.

## Preferred path

Like villagers, iron golems in Bedrock Edition use a strategy of pathfinding that prioritizes walking on certain "low-cost" blocks.

Iron golems attempt to walk on a one-block-wide path, despite them being two blocks wide. An iron golem favors a wider path if it sees one.

### Climbing
Iron golems can climb ladders or vines if the ladder or vine is in its path, or if pushed onto a ladder or vine.
