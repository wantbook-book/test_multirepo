# Strider
Striders are the only passive mobs native to the Nether. They can walk/stride on lava and be saddled by the player. A warped fungus on a stick is needed to control a strider, similar to how a pig is controlled by a carrot on a stick.

## Spawning
Striders can spawn in every Nether biome. Two to four striders spawn on spaces of lava that have an air block above. In Java Edition, striders are the only passive mob in the Nether, so spawning attempts are made every 400 game ticks. In Bedrock Edition, striders share the animal population cap with hoglins and their spawn rate depends on the biome, being impacted by the ability of other mobs to spawn at a given coordinate.

For every strider that spawns, there is a 1 in 10 chance of an additional baby strider to spawn riding on top of the previous strider. This behavior is limited to one strider.[1] A baby strider on the adult strider continues to grow although it does not dismount the adult strider once it has grown up. 

Zombified piglins have a 1 in 30 chance of spawning on top of a strider. If this happens, the strider spawns with a saddle and the zombified piglin spawns carrying a warped fungus on a stick. The zombified piglin does not despawn naturally, and does not count toward the mob cap. On Peaceful difficulty, the zombified piglin despawns immediately, leaving a saddled strider.[2]

If a strider spawns under lava, it rises out of the lava. In Bedrock Edition, baby striders spawn more commonly than adult striders do, including when spawned by a spawn egg.

1. ↑MCPE-112761 - Strider drops are not affected by Looting

Striders wearing a saddle always drop the saddle upon death, regardless of if they spawn wearing it or if a player puts it on them. The only way to remove a saddle from a strider is to kill the strider. 
When an adult strider is killed by a player or tamed wolf, 1–3 experience is dropped. Killing a baby strider yields no items or experience.

## Behavior
Lava does not damage striders. Unlike most mobs, striders can walk on top of lava without sinking. Upon being harmed by another mob, striders attempt to flee for a few seconds while making "retreat" noises. Striders are damaged by water, rain, and splash water bottles, which deal damage by 1 per splash water bottle or half-second in water or rain, which can kill them. While in water, they slowly sink while taking damage. Striders still take damage from rain even if they are in lava. However, they are not harmed when standing in a filled cauldron. They also cannot be harmed by snowfall or snowballs. They take extra damage from freezing in powder snow.

Unlike piglins and hoglins, striders can exist safely in the Overworld, as long as they are kept away from water and rain. Unlike some other mobs, striders do not zombify when leaving the Nether. Striders outside of lava change to a dull purple color, change their expression to more of a frown, shiver, and their legs become slightly shorter. They also move slower when outside of lava.[3]

If a strider has the Speed effect applied to it, the strider moves faster on both land and lava (though its land speed is still considerably slower). If a zombified piglin is riding a strider, the strider pursues the player if the zombified piglin is angered.

Due to a bug,[4] striders that fall from a height take fall damage when landing in lava. A baby strider on an adult strider still grows into an adult. Apart from this, adult striders riding other adult striders do not spawn naturally. Baby striders not riding on an adult follow the closest adult strider.
