# Java Edition 22w13oneBlockAtATime
22w13oneBlockAtATime (known as 22w13oneblockatatime in the launcher) is an April Fools' joke snapshot, supposedly the first and only snapshot for the "One Block at a Time Update", released on April 1, 2022,[1] which overhauled the player's inventory as well as the game logic for blocks, items and entities, and redesigned relevant gameplay aspects such as controlling, breaking and crafting. This version is a fork of a commit between 1.18.2 and 22w11a, as it contains several blocks (not complete) from the deep dark biome.

		- Thrown items are implemented asfalling_blockentities.
		- Thrown items (or indeed anyfalling_block) can be caught in midair by hitting it.
	- Items that do not have a block form are converted togeneric_item_blockwith the appropriate data.
- Items can be crafted by placing a recipe above at least one crafting table, throwing the last item (recipe patterns top facing away from the player, but defaulting to north when not thrown by a player)
	- Alternatively, the recipe can be placed and a crafting table can then be thrown to land on the recipe.
- Tools may be used but break with one use.
	- Tools break even in situations when they would not lose any durability.
- Certain items (e.g. top of the door, tall grass, etc) have "invalid" block data and will disappear when they land (as an item). It is still possible to place them, however.
- Food items cannot be eaten, even in Creative mode, since using them on a block places them, and using them otherwise throws them.
