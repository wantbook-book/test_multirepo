## Behavior
Pillagers are hostile toward players, iron golems, wandering traders and adult villagers. Pillagers also aid other pillagers attacked by other mobs. In Bedrock Edition, a pillager that accidentally harms a vindicator or evoker causes it to retaliate and attack the pillager.[1] In Java Edition, pillagers do not retaliate on vindicators or evokers that attack them.

Pillagers do not attack players in Creative mode. A pillager also does not attack if summoned with commands in Bedrock Edition using the minecraft:calm attribute.

When a player is in Creative mode or applied with the Invisibility effect, getting near a pillager still causes it to take notice and stare at the player. If a pillager notices an enemy while staring at the player, the pillager stops staring and attacks the enemy. If a player with the invisibility effect attacks a pillager, the pillager still retaliates.

A pillager attacks by shooting arrows from its crossbows every three seconds from up to eight blocks away and pursues enemies for up to 64 blocks in Java Edition or 16 blocks in Bedrock Edition.

Pillagers move slowly when wandering or loading crossbows in Java Edition. In Bedrock Edition, pillagers move from one place to another as fast as when they're provoked, although they stop and look around, pointing their crossbows along. Pillagers point their crossbows at any player or mob they are looking at, whether their crossbows are loaded or unloaded.

A pillager stares at the player and points its crossbow toward the player when the player is in creative mode or when the player has the invisibility status effect.
The patrol captain wears an ominous banner, known as the illager banner in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, on its head. The other illagers follow the captain around. The pillagers that are part of a patrol do not attack immediately. The patrol members' heads turn to follow the player or mob who attracted their attention. If the player or villager-like mob attacks or approaches within ten blocks of the patrol members, then this provokes them into loading their crossbows and attacking.[2]

If raiding pillagers kill all the villagers in a village, they celebrate their victory by jumping and laughing. Unarmed pillagers also cheer. In Bedrock Edition, pillagers wave their arms while holding their crossbows in their main hand when cheering.

Pillagers can take and equip illager banners within 3 blocks, but non-raider pillagers do not search for ominous banners.

In Java Edition, if a pillager gets attacked by a mob (excluding illagers and goats) or player, it alerts other pillagers to target the attacker unless the pillager was killed in one hit.

### Crossbow usage
#### Java Edition
Pillagers can also use crossbows in their off-hand. When a pillager finds a target, the pillager chases the target, then locks the target in its attack range and loads its crossbow.

Pillagers with their crossbows loaded can attack at any blocks away if the target is out of their attack range.

Pillagers, unlike evokers or vindicators, attack on sight, not regarding distance, although attacking a pillager, vindicator or evoker far away causes the attacked illager and the same type of illagers around the attacked illager to attack the player regardless of distance. 

The command /summon pillager ~ ~ ~ {} summons a passive pillager that does not attack.

A pillager's crossbow eventually breaks with repeated use, unlike weapons wielded by other mobs.[3] Unarmed pillagers are passive toward the player, iron golems and villagers, but they still frighten villagers and iron golems are still hostile toward them. This also includes pillagers that don't have a crossbow, which means any pillagers with a sword or any weapon other than a crossbow are still passive. An unarmed pillager always faces any player in its field of view or any mob that attacks it.

A pillager spawned with arrows or firework rockets in its off-hand slot uses them, depleting the stack over time and switching to regular arrows once running out of ammunition.[4] When firing firework rockets, pillagers aim above the target as when using arrows, despite rockets being unaffected by gravity.[5]

#### Bedrock Edition
Pillagers cannot use their crossbows in their off-hand, as mobs cannot use weapons in their off-hand, just like players.

The differences between the pillager texture in Java Edition (left) and Bedrock Edition (right).
Pillagers use an outdated behavior.[6][7] They also have different arm textures.[8] Pillagers load their crossbows upon spawning or if their crossbows are unloaded. When a pillager finds a target, it loads its crossbow first, chases the target and attacks upon in range. Pillagers are not hostile to players before their crossbows are loaded, so sometimes they don't look at players or run around while loading their crossbows. 

A dispenser can equip a pillager with armor. However, an armor item isn't rendered on pillagers.

If a player summons a pillager without a crossbow by spawn event command, it still shoots arrows to attack targets, like other arrow-shooting ranged mobs. This is due to the fact that in the pillager.json and ranged piglin.json files, the component_groups have both minecraft:behavior.ranged_attack and minecraft:behavior.charge_held_item, so if a pillager does not have a crossbow, the charge_held_item behavior cannot trigger and it continuously shoots arrows due to the ranged_attack behavior.

Unlike in Java Edition, the crossbows of pillagers in Bedrock Edition don't break.[9]

Pillagers use a melee attack while underwater, unlike pillagers in Java Edition that maintain using crossbows underwater, although the shot arrows travel slower underwater and sink after a short distance.
