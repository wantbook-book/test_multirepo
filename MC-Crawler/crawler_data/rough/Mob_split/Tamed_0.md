## Mechanics
Two tamed parrots on the player’s shoulders.
Each animal can be tamed via different mechanics. Wolves can be tamed by giving the animal bones. Cats and parrots can be tamed by giving the animal its favorite food. Once tamed, these animals follow the player unless told to sit. Tamed wolves fight alongside their master. Tamed wolves and cats can be bred, and they stop hunting animals by themselves. Tamed parrots can ride on the player's shoulder and mimic nearby mob sounds.

Horses, donkeys, mules, llamas and trader llamas can be tamed by repeatedly mounting the animal until it stops bucking the player off. Feeding them their favorite foods makes taming them easier. Once tamed, these animals can be bred and given equipment. Tamed horses, donkeys and mules can be controlled while riding, but only if equipped with a saddle. Camels are always tamed and can be controlled with a saddle.

In Bedrock Edition, skeleton horses do not need a saddle to be controlled while riding. Skeleton horses can be tamed by the player if the skeleton rider is killed. In Java Edition, Zombie horses normally cannot be tamed, but they can be spawned tamed using commands.

Upon the death of a pet wolf, cat, or parrot the message is broadcast to the pet's owner in Java Edition or to all players in the server in Bedrock Edition. In Bedrock Edition, death messages are also produced upon the death of a pet horse, donkey, mule, llama, or trader llama.

#### Trusting
Some mobs can never be tamed per se, but the player can still gain their trust. Trusting mobs stop fleeing from players, and they do not despawn.

A fox's trust actually can't be gained if the animal spawned naturally, but they can still be bred by the player. Fox kits bred this way trust players. A trusting fox defends the player against a number of mobs.

An ocelot's trust can be gained by feeding it raw cod or salmon.

## Special items
These are the foods and other items that are helpful in taming animals or otherwise gaining their trust. No items are required for taming camels, llamas, trader llamas, skeleton horses, and zombie horses.
