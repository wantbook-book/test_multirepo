### Knockback reduction
Each netherite armor piece gives a knockback resistance (or reduction) of 10%, protecting 40% of all knockback with a full set.

### Enchantments
See also: Enchanting

Armor can be enchanted to provide various enchantments. Enchantments can provide more protection or allow armor to protect certain types of damage that armor doesn't normally protect against, such as fall damage or fire. Damage reduction from enchantments does not decrease the armor's durability. Armor enchantments do not appear on the armor bar.

An armor's material determines how enchantable it is. The higher a material's enchantability, the greater the chances of getting multiple and high-level enchantments (see enchantment mechanics for details).

| Leather | Golden | Chainmail | Iron | Turtle Shell | Diamond | Netherite |
|---------|--------|-----------|------|--------------|---------|-----------|
| 15      | 25     | 12        | 9    | 9            | 10      | 15        |

As with several enchantments, several different levels of protection are possible. The maximum level of a protection enchantment is currently IV (4). Protection enchantments from multiple pieces of armor stack together, up to a calculated maximum.

Each protection enchantment protects against specific types of damage. The amount of damage reduction depends on the Enchantment Protection Factor (EPF) provided by that enchantment.

| Enchantment           | Damage reduced for                            | Type Modifier | EPFLevel I | EPFLevel II | EPFLevel III | EPFLevel IV |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Protection            | All                                           | 1             | 1          | 2           | 3            | 4           |
| Fire Protection       | Fire,lava, andblazefireballs                  | 2             | 2          | 4           | 6            | 8           |
| Blast Protection      | Explosions                                    | 2             | 2          | 4           | 6            | 8           |
| Projectile Protection | Arrows, throwntridents,ghastandblazefireballs | 2             | 2          | 4           | 6            | 8           |
| Feather Falling       | Fall damage (includingender pearls)           | 3             | 3          | 6           | 9            | 12          |

When a player or mob wearing armor is subjected to damage, the EPFs of all applicable enchantments are added together, capped at 20, and then damage reduction is cappedEPF / 25, giving a maximum reduction of 20‚ÅÑ25 (80%) at EPF 20. 

Because of the caps in the calculation, it is possible to achieve maximum protection against specific types of damage with just three pieces of armor. For example, two pieces of armor with Blast Protection IV (EPF 8 each) and a single piece with Protection IV (EPF 4) would give a total EPF of 20 versus explosions. Any additional EPF would be wasted against explosions (but might be useful against other types of damage, if applicable).

If the damage is of a type that armor protects against normally, this reduction applies only to the damage that got through the armor. 

It is possible using /give to obtain armor with an enchantment level higher than what is normally obtainable via normal survival. Using this method, a player could give themselves, for example, a full set of diamond armor with a Protection V enchantment on every piece. Following the algorithm above, we find that, because Protection V has an EPF of 5, the armor reaches the maximum EPF of 20 for all types of damage. Any higher Protection enchantments could be used to reach the cap with just one level XX (20) enchantment, rather than having a full set of enchanted armor, but would be wasted if all pieces shared the same level enchantment.

The table below shows all armor enchantments at their max levels:

| Armor Enchantment     | Max Level |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| Protection            | IV        |
| Fire Protection       |           |
| Blast Protection      |           |
| Projectile Protection |           |
| Feather Falling       |           |
| Respiration           | III       |
| Thorns                |           |
| Depth Strider         |           |
| Unbreaking            |           |
| Soul Speed            |           |
| Swift Sneak           |           |
| Frost Walker          | II        |
| Aqua Affinity         | I         |
| Mending               |           |
| Curse of Binding      |           |
| Curse of Vanishing    |           |

Note: Only one form of protection can be applied to a piece of armor (i.e. a chestplate cannot have both Fire Protection and Blast Protection, unless using commands to get all protection enchants in one piece of armor). Feather Falling, Frost Walker, Depth Strider and Soul Speed are enchantments applicable only to boots. Respiration and Aqua Affinity are enchantments applicable only to helmets. Swift Sneak is enchantment applicable only to leggings.

### Durability
Any hit from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). The following chart displays how many hits each piece of armor can endure.

| Material     | Helmet | Chestplate | Leggings | Boots |
|--------------|--------|------------|----------|-------|
| Turtle Shell | 275    | N/A        | N/A      | N/A   |
| Leather      | 55     | 80         | 75       | 65    |
| Golden       | 77     | 112        | 105      | 91    |
| Chainmail    | 165    | 240        | 225      | 195   |
| Iron         | 165    | 240        | 225      | 195   |
| Diamond      | 363    | 528        | 495      | 429   |
| Netherite    | 407    | 592        | 555      | 481   |

The chart below shows the durability per unit of material for each piece of armor, compared to that of the boots. Note that the durability per unit does not depend on the tier of the armor.

|                 | Helmet | Chestplate | Leggings | Boots |
|-----------------|--------|------------|----------|-------|
| Durability/Unit | 68%    | 61%        | 66%      | 100%  |

This means that for the same number of leather/iron ingots/gold ingots/chainmail/diamond, boots can take 1.5 more damage than leggings. Thus, chestplates and leggings offer more defense points per unit, but have less durability per unit.

Armor worn by a non-player mob does not lose durability when attacked by any means. Helmets that are worn by undead mobs lose durability when exposed to sunlight due to absorbing the mob's damage from sunlight.

Netherite armor does not lose durability from lava or fire damage.
