#### Bedrock Edition
In Bedrock Edition, the number of waves depends on difficulty, regardless of Bad Omen level without any additional waves. There are three waves in Easy difficulty, five in Normal, and seven in Hard. They spawn with enchanted weapons at level 5 on Easy and at levels 5-19 in other difficulties. There are no attempts to spawn additional mobs in any difficulty.

### Loot
All mobs in a raid drop their own regular loot.

** Special Drops **
The raid captain drops

- 1Ominous Banner

#### In Java Edition
Pillagers, vindicators, and evokers drop their regular loot.

#### In Bedrock Edition
In addition to regular loot, pillagers and vindicators can drop:

- 0-1Emerald

Additionally, depending on difficulty, they have a 65% chance of dropping on Easy and Normal, while 80% chance of dropping on Hard:

- 0-1Emerald(10⁄39chance)
- 2-3Emerald(5⁄39chance)
- 4-5Emerald(2⁄39chance)
- 1Enchanted Book(2⁄39chance)
- 1Iron Axe(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Shovel(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Pickaxe(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Sword(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Helmet(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Chestplate(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Leggings(5⁄78chance)
- 1Iron Boots(5⁄78chance)

Note:

- Iron equipment from raider drops has 50% chance of being enchanted with random enchantment(s) at a low-to-medium level.[more information needed]
- Iron equipment from raider drops is always damaged.
- Enchanted books from raider drops have random enchantments at a high level, including treasure enchantments (but notSoul SpeedorSwift Sneak).[more information needed]
- Emerald is both a regular raid drop and an additional drop.
	- Only emerald drops are affected by looting enchantment, increased by 1% per looting level.

In Java Edition, villagers give the player extra loot (gifts) after the raid, while in Bedrock Edition, the illagers drop extra loot when killed.

### Raid Omen
Main articles: Bad Omen and Raid Omen
In Java Edition, the Bad Omen status effect level of the player who triggered the raid also affects the raid mechanism. When the Bad Omen level is higher than one, an additional wave spawns with the same strength as the final wave. With a higher level of Bad Omen to a raid, the illagers in the raid have a higher chance of being equipped with enchanted weapons. The Bad Omen transforms into Raid Omen in which players can drink milk to remove the Raid Omen effect or leave the village before the effect ends. In Bedrock Edition, Bad Omen does not affect the enchanted weapons.

### Ending
If the attacked village no longer registers as a village (i.e. all villagers were killed or all claimed bed, bell, and profession blocks were destroyed), the raid ends, the Raid bar displays "Raid - Defeat", and all of the illagers celebrate: the evokers, pillagers and vindicators raise their hands, the pillagers jump up and down‌[JE  only] or raise their hands,‌[BE  only] and all of them emit "celebration sounds".

If all illagers are killed in the final wave, any player who has killed an illager in the raid receives the Hero of the Village effect at the same level as the Bad Omen level of the raid. The villagers shoot off fireworks, and the Raid bar displays "Raid - Victory". The Hero of the Village effect activates only when the player is in the village where the raid was defeated, and the effect wears off if the player leaves the village.

Raids cannot end naturally if at least one baby villager remains, because illagers are passive to baby villagers, except for the “Johnny” vindicator.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

In some cases a raid ends after a set amount of time, if all left over raiders cannot move.
