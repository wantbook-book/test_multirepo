### Sharing food
If a villager has enough food in one inventory stack (6 bread or 24 carrots, potatoes, beetroots, or 18 wheat for farmers only) and sees a villager without enough food in one inventory stack (3 bread or 12 carrots, potatoes or beetroot for non-farmers; 15 bread, 60 carrots, potatoes, or beetroot, or 45 wheat for Farmers), the villager may decide to share food with that villager.

To share, a villager finds its first inventory stack with at least 4 bread, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot or with at least 6 wheat, and then throws half the stack (rounded down) in the direction of the target villager. When wheat is shared, it is first crafted to bread which may result in 1 or 2 less than half the stack being shared.

### Farming
Adult and baby brown-robed villagers, both farmers and other careers, tend crops within the village boundary. Villagers far enough outside the boundary of any village also tend nearby crops.

Farmland to be tended is found by seeking for certain blocks up to 15 blocks away from the villager in X and Z and up to 1 away in Y (a 31×31×3 area total).

- If a brown-robed villager does not have enough food in one stack in its inventory (15 bread, 60 carrots, potatoes, or beetroot, or 45 wheat) and finds fully-grown wheat, carrots, potatoes or beetroot, it moves to the crop block and break it.
- If a brown-robed villager has any seeds, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot seeds in its inventory and finds an air block above farmland, it moves to it and plant a crop. They always plant from the first eligible slot in their inventory.
- If/gamerule mobGriefingisfalse, villagers cannot farm.

### Baby villager behavior

Baby villagers sprint around, entering and leaving houses randomly. They sometimes stop sprinting to stare at an iron golem. If the iron golem is holding a poppy, it might attract any baby villagers near it.

Baby villagers in Bedrock/Legacy Console Editions have a slightly bigger head than in the Java Edition, this also can be seen in different baby mobs in the game as well.

Unlike other breed-able mobs, the parents and child have no personal interactions other than socializing.

### Zombies
Main articles: Siege and Zombie
Zombies try to find and attack villagers within a 42 block radius (even when the villager is invisible), and attempt to break down doors. Zombies successfully break doors only if the difficulty is set to hard, although only a fraction of zombies spawned in Hard mode have the capacity to break doors. This also applies to zombie pigmen if they path find through a door. Villagers flee from zombies, sometimes hiding in houses. The villager's only "natural" defense are the iron golems, which attack nearby hostile mobs. 

Zombies try to kill villagers, or convert them to v1 zombie villagers. The chance for a villager to become a zombie villager on death is 0% on Easy, 50% on Normal, and 100% on Hard. Baby villagers can be infected by zombies as well.

Villagers also flee from zombie pigmen, although the latter do not attack them.

Drowned chase and attack villagers in the same way as zombies, and villagers run from drowned in the same way they run from zombies. Drowned can also convert villagers to zombie villagers, even when attacking from a distance with a trident.

### Lightning
When lightning strikes within 3–4 blocks of a villager, it turns into a witch.

## Breeding
See also: Tutorials/Legacy Console village mechanics

Two villagers mating.
Villagers mate depending on the number of valid doors. If "willing" (see below), villagers mate as long as the population is less than 35% (Bedrock Edition: 100%) of valid doors, rounded down. The type of villager that spawns is independent of the villager's parents.

A valid door is any door within the village radius where the number of "outside" spaces within 5 blocks in a straight line on one side of the door is not the same as the number of "outside" spaces within 5 blocks on the other side of the door. A space is considered to be "outside" if it has nothing but transparent blocks above it all the way to the sky.

A census is periodically taken to determine the current population of the village. All villagers within the horizontal boundary of the village and within 5 vertical blocks (Bedrock Edition: no apparent height limit) of the center is counted as part of the population to determine if continued villager mating is allowed. However, any villager within the horizontal boundary of the village and within the spherical boundary of the village attempts to enter mating mode as long as there is at least one villager within the boundary. If two villagers simultaneously enter mating mode while they are close to one another, they mate with each other and produce a child.

### Willingness
Additionally, villagers must be "willing" in order to breed. After mating, they are no longer willing, and must be made willing again.

Villagers can become willing by having either 3 bread, 12 carrots, 12 potatoes, or 12 beetroots in one stack in their inventory. Any villager with an excess of food (usually farmers) throw food to other villagers, allowing them to pick it up and obtain enough food to become willing. The player can also throw bread, carrots, beetroots, or potatoes at the villagers themselves to encourage breeding. Villagers consume the required food upon becoming willing. 

Villagers may also become willing when the player trades with them. Willingness is granted the first time a new offer is traded, or at a one-in-five chance on subsequent trades. Most of the time, villagers becomes willing after the second or third trade. Green particles appear if the villager becomes willing by trading. This does not cause them to immediately seek out a mate, however.

Before Java Edition 1.8, willingness was not implemented. The only factor needed is enough valid doors.
