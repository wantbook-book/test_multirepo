### Starvation
When the hunger bar becomes empty (), the player takes 1 damage every four seconds. The player stops taking starvation damage when the player eats food or the health bar drops to 10 on Easy difficulty or 1 on Normal difficulty. In Hard difficulty and on Hardcore mode, the player continues taking damage, which stops upon eating something or death by starvation.

All mobs are immune to starvation, because they do not have a hunger bar.

### Cactus
Players and mobs take 1 damage every half-second when they are touching or within the same tile-space as a cactus.

### Berry bush
Sweet berry bushes deal 1 damage for every half-second when a player or mob (besides foxes) is moving inside a sweet berry bush.

### Fire
When mobs and players without fire immunity stand on fire, they take 1 damage every half-second and get burned. Standing in soul fire does 2 damage every half-second instead. They continue burning after leaving the fire block. Fire damage can be prevented by the Fire Resistance effect. Fire duration can be decreased with the Fire Protection enchantment. Most Nether mobs are immune to fire, but they can still drown in lava.

Players do not take damage from fire if the game rule fireDamage is set to false.

### Lava
Lava is a dangerous natural occurrence. Players and mobs (except various Nether mobs) get burned and take damage from contact with lava at a rate of 4 every half-second, and they continue burning after they leave it. Fire Resistance nullifies both the direct damage from lava and the burning damage.

Players do not take damage from lava if the game rule fireDamage is set to false.

Ghasts sometimes take a dive into the lava seas in the Nether, magma cubes can hop around on lava, in a similar manner to floating. Striders can walk across lava.

### Burning
Players and many mobs burn when exposed to fire or lava or attacked by certain kinds of burning projectiles, Fire Aspect weapons, or burning zombies.‌[Java Edition  only] In addition, armor itself does not reduce burning damage; to do so, armor needs either the Fire Protection enchantment, Protection enchantment, or the Resistance status effect. Burning obstructs the player's view slightly and, unless the player or mob has Fire Resistance, inflicts damage at a rate of 1 per second. This is the same rate that the player gains health in Peaceful difficulty, so burning alone cannot kill the player in this mode. Burning lasts some amount of time depending on its cause, but it is extinguished by rain, water, or cauldrons.

Players do not take damage from burning if the game rule fireDamage is set to false.

Except for piglins, hoglins, skeletons, and endermen, mobs that spawn in the Nether do not burn and cannot be damaged by fire. Wardens also do not burn. Burning is not considered a status effect and therefore cannot be cured by milk.

### Magma block
Mobs without fire immunity and players take 1 damage every half-second if they are walking on magma blocks. This can be avoided by having the Fire Resistance effect, sneaking, or wearing Frost Walker-enchanted boots.

Players do not take damage from magma blocks if the game rule fireDamage is set to false.

### Campfire
Players or mobs standing on top of a campfire take 1 damage every half second. Standing in a Soul Campfire does 2 damage every half second instead. Unlike any other damage sources, armor itself does not reduce campfire and soul campfire damage; to do so, armor needs either the Fire Protection enchantment, Protection enchantment, or the Resistance status effect. In Bedrock Edition, it also inflicts damage for 160 game ticks (8 seconds) after the player exits the block.

Players do not take damage from campfires if the game rule fireDamage is set to false.

### Status effects
Main article: Status effect
Status effects are either helpful or harmful conditions that can be given to players and mobs alike. They can be given in different ways: being in range of thrown splash potions or lingering potions, being afflicted by certain mobs' attacks, simply being near certain mobs, being near conduits and beacons, and eating specific types of food (such as rotten flesh or raw chicken). Status effects can last for a certain amount of time, or can happen instantaneously.

Entities under a status effect emit colored particles, with the color of the particles resembling the type of status effect. Having multiple status effects combines the respective colors.

#### Instant damage
Main article: Instant Damage
Instant Damage caused by potions or tipped arrows can damage the player 6 at level I and 12 × 6 at level II.  This damage occurs instantaneously.  Undead mobs are instead healed, but are similarly damaged by the Healing effect.  Zombified piglins that are splashed by a instant damage potion do not attack the player who threw it, as it heals them.

#### Poison
Main article: Poison
Cave spiders, witches and bees poison players when they attack (except on easy difficulty). Pufferfish inflict poison as defense against players or certain mobs if they are nearby.  Poisoning also occurs upon eating a spider eye, poisonous potato, pufferfish, or suspicious stew made out of lily of the valley. Drinking or being hit by a potion or arrow of poison also results in poisoning. While poisoned, the hearts in the health meter turn from  × 10 ( × 10 on Hardcore) to an olive green ( × 10)( × 10 on Hardcore) and the player takes 1 every 25 ticks (1.25 seconds) on level I. See Poison for a table for higher levels. The Poison itself cannot kill the player, but it can reduce them to half a heart (), thus leaving them vulnerable to damage from other sources.
