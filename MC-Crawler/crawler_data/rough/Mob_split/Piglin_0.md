# Piglin
A piglin is a neutral mob found in the Nether. It is hostile to players unless they wear at least one piece of golden armor. It can be given gold ingots to barter for various items. It wields either a golden sword or a crossbow, and uses either melee or ranged attacks, respectively. 

Baby piglins do not grow up, never hold weapons or attack, and take gold without giving anything in return.

## Spawning
Piglins spawn in groups of 2-4 in nether wastes and crimson forest biomes, and within bastion remnants upon generation, at light levels of 11 in Java Edition or 7 in Bedrock Edition and below on most blocks other than nether wart blocks and magma blocks. In Bedrock Edition, they can naturally spawn on Peaceful difficulty. Each piglin has a 20%‌[Java Edition  only] or 5%‌[Bedrock Edition  only] chance to spawn as a baby.

Each adult piglin has a 50% chance to spawn with a weapon: either a sword [more information needed] or a crossbow [more information needed]. An adult piglin can also spawn with armor. Each armor slot on a piglin has 10% chance per armor slot to spawn with golden armor. Therefore, each piglin has a 34.39% chance to spawn with at least 1 piece of armor, and a 0.01% chance to spawn with a full set. Baby piglins never spawn with weapons or armor.

A baby piglin can also be spawned by using a piglin spawn egg on an adult piglin.

## Drops
### On death
| Item |             | Roll Chance | Quantity (Roll Chance) |           |            |             |
|------|-------------|-------------|------------------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
|      |             |             | Default                | Looting I | Looting II | Looting III |
|      | Piglin Head | 100%[d 1]   | 1                      | 1         | 1          | 1           |

1. ↑Only when killed by a charged creeper.

If a piglin is killed in one hit while admiring a gold ingot, the ingot drops. However, if the piglin is hit and not killed, the piglin stops admiring the item. This causes the item to vanish from its hands and subsequently not drop when the piglin is killed.

### Equipment
Adults have an 8.5% chance [more information needed] of dropping each naturally held or worn  piece of equipment. The dropped item has a random durability. Each level of Looting used to kill the piglin increases the drop chance for each piece of equipment by 1%.

Babies always spawn without equipment.

#### Weapons
A piglin naturally spawns with either of these weapons:

- Golden Sword[more information needed]
- Crossbow[more information needed]

#### Armor
Adults sometimes [more information needed] spawn with 1-4 normal or enchanted pieces of armor, which may be:

- Golden Helmet
- Golden Chestplate
- Golden Leggings
- Golden Boots

### Picked up equipment
Piglins always drop picked up equipment that they spawned with.

Piglins can pick up any type of armor of weapon, as long as the new equipment is better than the current equipment. See § Picking up items.

In Java Edition, a picked-up item always drops with the same durability as when picked up.

In Bedrock Edition, armor [more information needed] picked up by piglins can lose durability and even break (if it takes enough damage).

### Other picked up items
Piglins do not drop any gold ingots, raw porkchops, or cooked porkchops that they have picked up.

### Experience
Adults drop 5 which is not affected by armor if killed by a player or tamed wolf. Baby piglins drop 5‌[JE  only][1] or 1‌[BE  only][2].

## Behavior
Piglins snort enviously while watching players holding a gold-related item.

Like villagers, piglins can open and close wooden doors but cannot open fence gates, all trapdoors, and iron doors. They also cannot climb Ladders.

Piglins cannot swim and can drown if submerged.[3] They are not naturally immune to fire or lava.[4]

Idle piglins retreat from zombified piglins, zoglins, soul fire, soul torches, soul lanterns, and lit soul campfires. Piglins ignore soul fire items when pursuing the player, but still run from zombified piglins and zoglins. Baby piglins additionally retreat from wither skeletons and withers.

Crossbow piglins do not reload their crossbows when spawned, unlike pillagers. They reload only when provoked.

Baby piglins are passive and play with baby hoglins, running around and riding upon them. Up to 3 baby piglins may stack on top of each other while riding a baby hoglin.

Baby piglins can be given gold, but they do not give anything in return and run away. Baby piglins can also pick up and wear armor as well as hold gold tools or weapons. However, they are unable to pick up leather.

Baby piglins never grow up.[5]

Unlike many other mobs, piglins cannot be spawned holding any items in their off-hand; instead, the item in question is placed into their inventory or, if applicable, their main hand or an armor slot.[6] As a consequence, they cannot fire special ammunition from their crossbows, such as firework rockets or tipped arrows, and they cannot use a totem of undying alongside a melee weapon. If spawned with an gold ingot in their off-hand, the piglin immediately drops a random bartering good without examining the ingot.
