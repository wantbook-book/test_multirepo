## Effect
Players under the effect of Conduit Power receive all of the benefits of Water Breathing, Night Vision, and Haste. This means that their breath meter does not decrease, it gets filled up even underwater‌[Bedrock Edition  only][1], they can sleep in a waterlogged bed‌[Bedrock Edition  only], they are able to see underwater, and their underwater mining speed increases.

Despite Conduit Power being able to prevent drowning, it does not stack with Water Breathing, which means if the player has both effects, the Water Breathing still ticks down.

Conduit Power I grants a benefit identical to the Haste effect as Haste I. Conduit Power X has an identical effect to Haste X. The levels of Water Breathing and Night Vision are unchanged by the level of Conduit Power. Conduit Power and Haste do not stack; the higher level effect is applied.

While Conduit Power grants the benefit of Night Vision, it is a separate effect. Night Vision can be applied separately by other sources and expires as usual while the player is inside the Conduit Power effect volume.

Higher levels of Conduit Power can be obtained only by using commands.

In Bedrock Edition, because the Conduit Power effect lasts for 12 seconds above water, night vision is activated but does not show borders.
