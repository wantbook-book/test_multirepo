### Experience orbs
Experience orbs fade between green and yellow colors and float or glide toward the player up to a distance of 7.25 blocks (calculated from the center of player's feet and the center of the experience orb), speeding up as they get nearer to the player. Experience orbs pulled toward a player are slowed by cobwebs. Experience orbs can also be pulled around or away from the player by running water currents.

When collected, experience orbs make a bell-like sound for a split second. Unlike resources, experience points are picked up gradually: no matter how many orbs are in the range of the player, they are added to the player's experience one at a time (10 orbs/second). In extreme cases, this can result in the player being followed by a swarm of orbs for many seconds. If an experience orb isn't collected within 5 minutes of its appearance, it disappears.

Experience orbs vary in value. The general worth of an orb is reflected by its size, with eleven possible sizes corresponding to specific values. The three smallest sizes are the most commonly encountered, as the majority of experience dropped by mobs and blocks is less than ten. Dense experience orbs, from values 17 and up, have orange "eyes" or "cores", and are less frequently encountered, most commonly from defeating the ender dragon, wither and other players, disenchanting objects on a grindstone, breaking spawners, and collecting items from high- traffic furnaces. For performance improvement, experience orbs of the same value can merge into a single entity, but they do not create a higher value orb.

| Orb | Minimum value | Maximum value |
|-----|---------------|---------------|
|     | -32768[3]     | 2             |
|     | 3             | 6             |
|     | 7             | 16            |
|     | 17            | 36            |
|     | 37            | 72            |
|     | 73            | 148           |
|     | 149           | 306           |
|     | 307           | 616           |
|     | 617           | 1236          |
|     | 1237          | 2476          |
|     | 2477          | 32767         |

Naturally spawned orbs always have an integer value of 1–11, 17, 37, 73, 149, 307, 617, 1237, or 2477. Fishing, breeding, and trading drop a single orb with a random value in the appropriate range. Breaking blocks, killing mobs and players, smelting items, and bottles o' enchanting calculate their total experience amount and then split it into values of 1, 3, 7, 17, 37, 73, 149, 307, 617, 1237, and 2477. Higher values are chosen first, so, for example, a total value of 1000 would be dropped as orbs with values 617, 307, 73, and 3. Note that while the first Ender Dragon in a world drops 12,000 experience, it is dropped in 10 waves of 1000 and one of 2000, so no orbs of value 2477 are dropped. Such orbs can only exist in the world via furnaces that have had a lot of traffic.

Experience orbs with negative values can be created using the /summon command, either using values below 0 or above 32767 due to 16-bit integer overflow. They have the smallest texture of experience orb. While collecting them does not affect the player's experience bar in any way, they can deduct durability from a tool enchanted with Mending, provided the tool is already damaged prior to collection of the orbs.[4]

Like items, experience orbs float when on water. Experience orbs can be destroyed by fire, lava, explosions, and cacti, and can trigger pressure plates and tripwires. Experience orbs can also stop minecarts. 

In Bedrock Edition, although mob drops spawn the instant the final blow is dealt to the mob, experience orbs do not appear until the mob entity disappears and the smoke appears.

In Java Edition, experience orbs appear in the same spatial and temporal location as loot when an entity is killed.

The following mobs and similar entities don't drop experience when killed:

- Babyanimals(except for the hoglin)
- Agent
- Allay
- Armor Stand
- Bat
- Camera
- Elder Guardian Ghost
- Iron Golem
- NPC
- Snow Golem
- Tadpole
- Villager
- Wandering Trader

1. ↑ a b c d e fFor fractional values, first multiply this value by the number of smelted items removed from the furnace, then award the player the whole-number part, and if there is a fractional part remaining, this represents the chance of an additional experience point.

For example, when smelting 1 coal ore and removing the coal, the value is 0.1, so this grants a 10% chance of getting 1 experience point.
Or, when smelting 64 cobblestone and removing all 64 stone, the value is 0.1 * 64 = 6.4, so this grants 6 experience points, plus a 40% chance of getting 1 additional experience point.
