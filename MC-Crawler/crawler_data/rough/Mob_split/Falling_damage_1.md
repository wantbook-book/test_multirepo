### Attack cooldown
"Cooldown" redirects here.  For the enchantment in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Cool Down.

  

This feature is exclusive to  Java Edition. 


Attack indicator (crosshair), empty and charged
Attack indicator (hotbar), empty and charged
When a player swings a weapon or switches to a weapon, they are locked into a cooldown meter that limits how much damage they can deal and requires them to wait before being able to deal maximum damage again. The base damage done depends on the time between attacks, and is also reflected in the height of the held weapon on screen and the attack indicator bar. The fill-level of the attack indicator bar (as a proportion of it's total width) is exactly equal to the damage the held weapon would deal if it was used now in proportion of its maximum damage. Therefore, the attack indicator appears fully charged when the damage dealt after cooldown reaches 100% of the maximum. There are settings for the attack indicators in the options menu. At 84.8% attack cooldown charge, critical hits, sweep attacks, and sprint-knockback attacks become possible.

The attackSpeed attribute controls the length of the cooldown time, with the time taken being T = 20 / attackSpeed ticks. The damage multiplier is then 0.2 + ((t + 0.5) / T) ^ 2 * 0.8, restricted to the range 0.2 – 1, where t is the number of ticks since the last attack or item switch.

Damage done by enchantments (Sharpness, Smite, and Bane of Arthropods) is also reduced, but not as severely (the multiplier is not squared):
