## Technical information
### ID
| Name      | Identifier  | Numeric ID |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Overworld | `overworld` | `0`        |

### Folder
In Java Edition, information on the Overworld is stored in the region folder of the .minecraft/saves/worldname directory, with "worldname" being the name of the player's world.

Deleting the region folder resets the Overworld so that all player-made changes and buildings in that dimension are undone.
