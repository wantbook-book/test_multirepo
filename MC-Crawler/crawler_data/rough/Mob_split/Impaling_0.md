## Obtaining
Impaling can be obtained from enchantment tables, drops from mobs that have spawned in a raid,‌[Bedrock Edition  only] books obtained by fishing, monster room chests, librarian villagers, and non-village structure loot.

## Usage
Each level of Impaling adds 2.5 ( × 1 1⁄4) extra damage per hit. This applies both to the trident projectile and in melee combat.

In Java Edition, only aquatic mobs receive the extra damage. Aquatic mobs include axolotls, dolphins, guardians, elder guardians, squids, glow squids, turtles and all variants of fish, but not drowned,[1] as drowned are classified as undead mobs rather than underwater mobs. A thrown trident with Impaling I will one hit kill most of these aquatic mobs (≤10 HP) with the exception of guardians and turtles, of which a thrown trident with Impaling III+ will kill in two hits (30 HP), and a thrown trident with Impaling V will kill an Elder Guardian (80 HP) in four hits.

In Bedrock Edition, as well as in Java Edition Combat Test 4 and after, the damage applies to all mobs and players when in contact with water: underwater, in flowing water, and in rain.[2]
