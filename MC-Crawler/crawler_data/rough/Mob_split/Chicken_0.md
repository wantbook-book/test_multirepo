## Spawning
Chickens spawn naturally in the Overworld in groups of four on grass blocks with 2 blocks of free space above it at a light level of 9 or more. They do not spawn in deserts, snowy plains, ice spikes, snowy slopes, meadows, wooded badlands, jagged peaks, frozen peaks and stony peaks. 
In Java Edition, chickens are more common in sparse jungles.

After the world generation, chickens spawn individually.

5% of chickens spawn as baby chickens. 

In Bedrock Edition, chickens require a light level of 7 or more to spawn and are found in groups of two to four.

### Chicken jockey
#### Java Edition
Main article: Chicken Jockey
All baby zombie variants and baby zombified piglins have a 5% chance to spawn riding a chicken, forming a chicken jockey. Because a baby zombie occurs from 5% of zombie spawns, the chicken jockey spawns consist of 0.25% of all zombie spawns in a chicken-free environment; if chickens are present, the chance increases to 0.4875%. A chicken jockey can also be spawned by using the following command: 

/summon minecraft:chicken ~ ~ ~ {IsChickenJockey:1b,Passengers:[{id:"minecraft:zombie",IsBaby:1b}]}

Chicken jockeys may spawn with items equipped. Baby zombified piglin versions of the chicken jockey always wield a golden sword. Harming or killing the chicken does not cause the zombified piglin to attack.

#### Bedrock Edition
Baby zombie jockeys do not spawn riding chickens, but check for nearby adult chickens to mount prior to attacking a player, wandering trader, adult villager, snow golem or iron golem.

## Drops
Main article: Tutorials/Chicken farming
Adult chickens that were not part of chicken jockeys lay an egg every five to ten minutes.

1. ↑Dropped as cooked chicken if on fire when killed.

1–3 experience orbs are dropped when a chicken is killed by a player or tamed wolf or 10 if it was part of a chicken jockey.

Killing a baby chicken yields no items or experience.

## Behavior
A chicken wanders aimlessly but goes after players holding various seeds within a 6×4×6 cubic area, while a baby chicken follows adult chickens.

Some chickens going after a player holding wheat seeds.
Chickens avoid falling off cliffs and flap their wings when they are in middle air and fall slowly, thus chickens are immune to fall damage.  

When harmed, chickens flee around for a few seconds. 

Chickens uniquely attempt to jump up to climb stairs instead of climbing them normally.[1]

Ocelots, untamed cats‌[JE  only] and foxes pursue and attack chickens. 

While in a loaded chunk, an adult chicken lays an egg every five to ten minutes (6000–12000 ticks), unless it is, or was, a part of a chicken jockey. If the player is close enough to a chicken when it lays an egg, a pop sound is heard.

Chickens can stay underwater for 15 seconds or can swim, visibly flapping their wings and staying on the water surface. While swimming, a chicken needs only one block of air above its head.

A chicken is 11 pixels or 0.6875 blocks tall. A chick is 5.5 pixels tall or 0.34375 blocks tall.
