## Description
A taiga biome in Bedrock Edition.
The taiga biome generates more or less commonly and its surface is a grassland with a large number of ferns, large ferns and pine and spruce trees, giving form to a somewhat dense boreal forest. The vegetation also includes grass, dandelions and sweet berry bushes and takes an aquamarine color tone. The water coloration has a unique dark-turquiose tone in in Bedrock Edition.

Only pine and spruce trees are natural to taigas, compared to oak, large oak and birch trees found in temperate forests. Due to the cone structure of pine and spruce trees, more tall than wide, the foliage is less dense, but still dense enough to possibly get players lost. 

Rainfall is very common and changes to snowfall above the layer Y=160±8 within taigas due to the humid and cold climate. 

The taiga biome borders old growth taigas, forests, birch forests, snowy taigas, groves, and swamps, or it is often separated from a meadow by a river. In addition to the taiga generation, the taiga may generate in the same temperature range as snowy plains, ice spikes and snowy taiga biomes, resulting in frozen rivers, snowy beaches and frozen oceans generating next to a taiga in a weird, incorrect, albeit intentional terrain generation.[1] Taigas that generated in the same temperature range as snowy plains, ice spikes, and snowy taiga biomes, are almost guaranteed to have lush caves underground, although, taigas that generated in temperatures of -0.150 to -0.450 are not guaranteed to have lush caves underneath them, but is still possible to have lush caves under them. In addition, when taigas generated far inland, dripstone caves may generate underneath them instead.

Pillager outposts, villages and trail ruins generate in taigas occasionally. These villages are made of spruce wood materials appropriately and often contain gardens with the poppy flower and pumpkin farms. Villages can also serve as a handy refuge with cats, villagers and iron golems and as a trading site should one be found.

Wolf, red fox, rabbit, sheep, chicken, pig and cow animal mobs spawn in taigas, though sheep and rabbits are not often seen due to untamed wolves chasing after them and killing them.  

Taigas are one of the most preferred biomes to start out in Survival mode. The abundance of logs, the grassy terrain and the useful amount of passive mobs make this biome easy for players. Taigas share the same dangers of forests however, as a player can get lost within the trees easily if they do not mark their trails and the foliage can lead to obstructed vision especially at night. 

The following mobs are naturally spawned here：
