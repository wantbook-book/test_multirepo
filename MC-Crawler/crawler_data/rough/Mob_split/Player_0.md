The player's skin can be changed. The nine default skins also have "classic" and "slim" shapes.

The player's appearance is commonly obscured by equipped armor such as turtle shells, as well as other equipable items such as elytra, carved pumpkins, and heads. Players are also the only entity capable of having capes, as well as deadmau5 ears, depending on the account.

In Java Edition, if shot with an arrow or stung by a bee, the arrow/stinger appears physically embedded inside of the player for a given time. These do not apply to other mobs.

Unlike their Java Edition counterparts, Bedrock Edition players periodically blink; this feature does not apply to custom skin models.

## Drops
- Contents of theirinventoryand armor unless/gamerule keepInventoryhas been set totrue.
- Current XP level times 7, capped at a total of 100 XP points. If/gamerule keepInventoryhas been set totrue, no XP is dropped.

## Differences between editions
### Java Edition
In Java Edition, the player can choose from Steve, Alex, Zuri, Sunny, Noor, Makena, Kai, Efe, or Ari. These nine models can be customized by downloading free skins from trusted websites or by using an editing program, but in the demo or when playing offline, the game randomly chooses any of the nine skins as the current skin.

### Bedrock Edition
In Bedrock Edition, the player can choose between Alex, Noor, Ari, Sunny, Makena, Efe, Zuri, Kai, or Steve in-game, which sets both the skin and the model for custom skins. However, Bedrock Edition also allows the usage of skin packs, each of which has a selection of free skins. On Windows and mobile devices, skins can also be imported from a PNG file. Some skins can be purchased as DLC. Bedrock Edition also features a skin creation system with free and purchasable apparel and features.

## Reach
The attack reach area of 3 blocks is indicated by the red circle.
A player has two kinds of reach. The area forms a three-dimensional cylinder because it encompasses vertical and horizontal distances:[1]

- The attack reach, which is 3 blocks
- The building reach, which is 4.5 blocks(5 blocks in creative mode)

## Health and hunger meters
Main articles: Health and Damage
The player has 10 full hearts or 20 health points. One full heart represents two health points. When the player's hunger bar is at 18 ( × 9) or higher, health slowly regenerates by 1 every four seconds, but when it is at 20 ( × 10) with saturation remaining, health regenerates by 1 every half second. The hunger bar depletes faster from energy-intensive activities like sprinting, jumping, attacking mobs, and mining, and it can be refilled by eating food. If the hunger bar is at 17 ( × 8.5) or lower, the player does not regenerate health unless in Peaceful difficulty (or under the effect of certain potions). While the hunger bar is at 0 (), the player is starving and proceeds to lose health. On Hard difficulty, starvation kills the player. On Normal difficulty, it brings health down to 1. On Easy difficulty, it brings health down to 10. On Peaceful difficulty, the health bar recovers regardless of hunger, but still depletes from starvation damage, and the hunger bar does not lose any points even when under the effect of hunger.
