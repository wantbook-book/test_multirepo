## Notes
1. ↑There is 0.04% chance for zombies and skeletons to spawn with diamond armor, but the chance is so negligible that it is infeasible to obtain diamond armor in this way.
2. ↑ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z aa ab ac ad ae af agWhen creating an enchantment offer, the game uses a random enchantment level from 5 – 19. The enchantments are never treasure enchantments.
3. ↑ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z aa ab ac ad ae af ag ah ai aj ak al am an ao ap aq ar asAs the villager cannot level up any further, they do not actually gain any experience.
4. ↑ a b c d eAll copies of the map traded by a particular villager lead to the same structure. In worlds that do not have the structure, this trade is not offered.
5. ↑ a b c d e f g h iThe list of possible offers contains individual offers for each color, so multiple colors may be offered by the same villager as separate trades.
6. ↑Available maps listed in the following table. They are divided into 3 groups, each of them is a individual offer, so multiple groups may be offered by the same villager as separate trades. Inside the group, trade is selected based on biomes.
7. ↑ a bThe type of boat trade depends on the biome outfit of the villager. Plains villagers buy oak boats, taiga and snowy villagers buy spruce boats, desert and jungle villagers buy jungle boats, savanna villagers buy acacia boats, and swamp villagers buy dark oak boats.
8. ↑The type of arrow is chosen randomly from all possible brewable potions with effects, including extended and strengthened versions. This is a single offer in the offer list (like enchanted books), not one offer per type (like various colored items).
9. ↑ a b c d e f g h i j k l m nThe leather armor has a random color created by two dyes (possibly the same dye twice.)
10. ↑ a b c d e f g hThe enchantment is chosen randomly with equal chance of any enchantment type occurring (except for Soul Speed and Swift Sneak) and equal chance to get any level of the enchantment, meaning high-level enchantments are as likely as low-level enchantments. It is possible for a librarian to sell the same book more than once.
The price in emeralds depends on the enchantment level and "treasure" status. The minimum price of a book is given by 2 + 3 * (enchantment level), while the maximum price is 6 + 13 * (enchantment level). The possible values are 5–19 emeralds for Lvl I, 8–32 for Lvl II, 11–45 for Lvl III, 14–58 for Lvl IV, and 17–71 for Lvl V. For treasure enchantments the price is doubled. The cost is capped at 64 emeralds. All values below this cap are equally probable.
11. ↑ a bThe trade is listed as two book and quill items, but because there is only one trading input slot, and books and quills cannot stack, the player needs to exchange only one book and quill in the trade.
12. ↑ a b cThe enchantment is chosen randomly from the "Common" enchantments listed on the table below according to the biome of the villagers. Every levels of these enchantment has equal chance to be chosen, meaning high-level enchantments are as likely as low-level enchantments. It is possible for a librarian to sell the same book more than once.
The price in emeralds depends on the enchantment level and "treasure" status. The minimum price of a book is given by 2 + 3 * (enchantment level), while the maximum price is 6 + 13 * (enchantment level).

The cost is capped at 64 emeralds. All values below this cap are equally probable.
13. ↑The enchantment is set from the "Special" enchantments listed on the table below according to the biome of the villagers. Unlike common enchantments, the level of enchantment is also defined.
The price in emeralds depends on the enchantment level and "treasure" status. The minimum price of a book is given by 2 + 3 * (enchantment level), while the maximum price is 6 + 13 * (enchantment level).

The cost is capped at 64 emeralds. All values below this cap are equally probable.
14. ↑ a bIf explorer maps are bought when in the Nether, the End or a superflat world, the explorer map does not show a destination structure, and buying it in an Old world causes the game to freeze
15. ↑The stew grants one of the following effects: 5-7 seconds of Blindness, 7-10 seconds of Jump Boost, 7-10 seconds of Night Vision, 10-20 seconds of Poison, 0.3-0.35 seconds of Saturation, or 6-8 seconds of Weakness.
16. ↑Potion level is always I, except for Arrow of Decay, which is always II
17. ↑Book and quill is offered in two item slots due to being non-stackable
18. ↑Only one item is offered (e.g. wandering trader cannot sell both brown dye and pink dye). Each group of single-offer trades has the same chance to be chosen as a normal trade based on weight. For example, each individual sapling does have the same chance of being offered as a slimeball, because the sapling group as a whole which consist of 4 items and has 4 weight (multiple saplings cannot be offered however).
19. ↑ a b c d e f g hCrop seeds offered in both grouped and individual trades
