## Spawning
Bogged can spawn in swamps and mangrove swamps in groups of four, and trial chambers via trial spawners.

### Trial spawners
Bogged have a chance to be selected as the "ranged" mob for trial spawners in trial chambers.

## Drops
### On death
| Item |                 | Roll Chance | Quantity (Roll Chance) |           |            |             |
|------|-----------------|-------------|------------------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
|      |                 |             | Default                | Looting I | Looting II | Looting III |
|      | Bone            | 100%        | 0–2                    | 0–3       | 0–4        | 0–5         |

↑ Dropped only when kill credit is given to the player


- Naturally spawned equipment is dropped damaged. Anenchantedbowhas an 8.5% chance of dropping if killed by theplayeror a tamedwolf(9.5% withLootingI, 10.5% with Looting II, and 11.5% with Looting III).
- Picked-up items always drop and drop with the same damage level it had when picked up.
- 5experienceorbs when killed by a player or a tamed wolf, and an extra1–3 orbs for each piece of natural equipment thatdoes notdrop upon death.
	- Because all bogged spawn with at least a bow, this means that an unarmored bogged drops6–8 if it does not drop its bow upon death.

### Shearing
A bogged drops 2 mushrooms when sheared. Each individual mushroom has an equal chance of dropping as either a brown or red mushroom. Afterward, it cannot be sheared again, and the mushrooms growing from its head are permanently removed.

## Behavior
Bogged behave the same as normal skeletons and shoot tipped arrows that inflict Poison for 4 seconds (dealing 3 damage) on any target that they hit. When shooting their bow, bogged are just as fast as skeletons or strays, but bogged have a longer cooldown between attacks. The cooldown is 3.5 seconds on Easy and Normal difficulties, or 2.5 seconds on Hard. This is 1.5 seconds slower than the skeleton's attack cooldown.

Unlike regular skeletons, bogged in powder snow take freezing damage and do not convert into strays.[2]

Being an undead mob, they are: 

- damaged by the status effectInstant Healthand healed by the status effectInstant Damage.
- unaffected by the status effectsRegenerationandPoison.
- ignored by thewither.
- affected by theSmiteenchantment.
- unable to swim inwater, but do not drown.
- a threat toarmadillos, causing them to hide in their shell.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80]
