## Spawning
In Java Edition, a pillager spawned by a player using a spawn egg or commands can be a captain, which has an ominous banner sticking out of its head.

### Patrols
In Java Edition, the number of pillagers spawning in each patrol varies from one to five and depends on the regional difficulty, with one spawning as a patrol captain. Patrols occur after 51⁄2 in-game days, any time and independently of structures, which means they still spawn in worlds without generated structures. A patrol spawns 24 to 48 blocks away from a random player, on the highest solid block. The individual pillagers of a patrol can spawn only at block light level less than 9, regardless of sky light.

In Bedrock Edition, each patrol spawns two to five pillagers. One of these pillagers is a patrol captain. After 51⁄2 in-game days, patrols appear 24 to 48 blocks away from the player, at a light level of 7 and below on Easy or any light level on Normal and Hard difficulty.

### Outposts
Pillagers continually spawn in a 72×54×72 block volume centered on the top floor in a pillager outpost. Some pillagers spawn as outpost captains. They may spawn on any valid opaque block if the block light level is less than or equal to 8. 

In Java Edition, there can be unlimited pillagers that spawn in outposts naturally, limited only by the natural spawning rules.

In Bedrock Edition, pillagers continually spawn at or below a particular location in the outpost, choosing the highest opaque block with a non-solid block on top and spawning on the northwest corner. A maximum of eight pillagers spawn naturally in an outpost.

### Raids
In a raid, pillagers are more common in the earlier waves and decrease in number as the waves progress. Despite this, they still constitute the majority of raiders in total. 

One pillager spawns riding a ravager in the fifth wave. 

In Bedrock Edition, one of the ravagers is ridden by a pillager instead of a vindicator on the seventh wave.

In Java Edition, pillagers spawn during bonus waves and have the largest chance of being the raid captain in the first wave, but in the second wave and onward, vindicators have a greater chance than pillagers of being the raid captain.

## Drops
A pillager drops upon death:

- InBedrock Edition, pillagers drop 0 - 2arrows. Each level of theLootingenchantment increases the maximum number of arrows dropped for up to five.
- There is a 8.5% chance to drop acrossbowwhen killed by theplayeror a tamedwolf. The crossbow may be loaded or unloaded depending on the crossbow's state when the pillager dies. The drop chance increases by 1% per level ofLooting. The crossbow is of a randomdurabilityand has a chance of being enchanted. The chance ranges from 0% to 10% depending on theregional difficulty. The enchantment level is from 5 to 19.
- 5experiencepoints and an additional1–3 points per naturally-spawned equipment when killed by the player or a tamed wolf, if the pillager does not drop their naturally-spawned equipment.
- Itsillagerominous bannerif spawned as acaptain.

In Bedrock Edition, pillagers that were spawned by raids have a 65% chance on easy and normal or 80% chance on hard difficulties to drop these:
