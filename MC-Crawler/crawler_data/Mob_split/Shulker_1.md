A shulker bullet is a guided projectile that is shot from shulkers. They follow the targeted entity along the X, Y, or Z axis and leave trails of white particles. A shulker bullet that hits a mob or player deals damage and affects them with Levitation for ten seconds.

The shulker's projectiles also have entity data that control its movement.

The bullet can be destroyed by hitting it with any item, shooting it with an arrow, or blocking it with a shield. It is also destroyed upon contact with a block or lava.

### Coloring
In Bedrock Edition, shulkers can be dyed in a similar fashion to sheep. Using a dye on a shulker gives it the color of the dye. They can be dyed only in Creative mode.

In Java Edition, the color of a shulker is changed through commands using the color byte tag.

## Transportation
A shulker is transported in the Overworld by boat. Pistons raise the boat uphill.
Shulkers can be moved by boats or minecarts; pushing a boat/cart into a shulker causes it to board. A boat's sides block some of a shulkers projectiles.

A shulker pushed through the exit portal gets transported to the world spawn point in the Overworld. Since shulkers teleport when not adjacent to a solid block, they must be pushed down the central pillar of the exit portal (or a manually placed block directly above the portal) with a piston. Alternatively, if a shulker is in a boat that has been ridden into the exit portal, it is possible to break the boat with an arrow shot at the boat. This causes the shulker to go through the exit portal. When riding the shulker into the exit portal by a boat, the boat becomes "submerged" in the portal fluid and exiting the boat causes the player to go through the exit portal.

Shulkers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.

Bullets fires by a shulker are probably fir
 APX: Approximate X coordinate.
 APY: Approximate Y coordinate.
 APZ: Approximate Z coordinate.
 AttachFace: Which face of its block the shulker is attached to. The shulker also opens in the direction going from the center of the block to that face when the shulker opens up. 0b means the the top face. 1b means the the bottom face. 2b means the the north face. 3b means the the south face. 4b means the the west face. 5b means the the east face.
 Color: The color of the shulker. Default is 0. Shulkers spawned by eggs or as part of End cities have value 16.
See Shulker/DV for color table.
 Peek: "Height" of the head of the shulker.
This "height" is measured in pixels from the bottom of the shulker, where 1 pixel = 1/16th of a block.[more information needed]
This "height" goes in the direction that the shulker is facing according to AttachFace.[more information needed]

 Steps: How many "steps" it takes to attack to the target. The higher it is, the further out of the way the bullet travels to get to the target. If set to 0, it makes no attempt to attack the target and instead uses TXD/TYD/TZD in a straight line.
 Target: The UUID of the target of this shulker bullet, stored as four ints.
 TXD: The offset in the X direction to travel in accordance with its target.
 TYD: The offset in the Y direction to travel in accordance with its target.
 TZD: The offset in the Z direction to travel in accordance with its target.
