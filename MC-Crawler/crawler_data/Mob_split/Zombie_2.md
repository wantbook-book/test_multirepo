## Behavior
### Attacking the player
Zombies pursue the player on sight from 35 blocks away in Java Edition or 16 blocks away in Bedrock Edition, raising their arms up.‌[JE  only] The detection range of zombies is reduced to half of their normal range (17.5 blocks) when the player is wearing a zombie head. If a zombie sees a player and a villager together, the zombie prefers to attack the player first. In Java Edition, zombies will keep chasing the player and will ignore other villagers. In Bedrock Edition, zombies prioritize the nearest player, villager, or golem.

Zombies periodically make groaning sounds, which can be heard up to 16 blocks away. Zombies attempt to avoid obstacles, including fall damage, fire, lava, magma blocks, and cactus and try to find the shortest path toward the player.[1] Unlike skeletons, zombies do not try to avoid being hit and continue to pursue the player even when being attacked.

### Attacking turtles
Zombies attack baby turtles and actively seek out and destroy turtle eggs within 24 blocks horizontally and 3 blocks vertically, by jumping on them until they crack and break.

### Attacking golems
Zombies pursue and attack only iron golems within 42 blocks; zombies ignore snow golems unless attacked. Iron golems and snow golems attack zombies without provocation, although snow golems deal only knockback to zombies with their snowballs.

### Attacking villagers
Zombies target villagers within a 35– to 52.5–block radius (depending on regional difficulty)‌[Java Edition  only] or a 16-block radius‌[Bedrock Edition  only] and they can always see villagers through walls. If a zombie is attacking a villager and sees the player, it interrupts its attack on the villager to attack the player instead, even if the player has not attacked it‌[JE  only]. Once a zombie has targeted a villager, the zombie ignores any other villagers and the player, until its target is dead or the zombie is attacked‌[JE  only].

Any zombie variant can transform a villager into a zombie villager. The probability depends on the difficulty:

- 0% chance inPeaceful(no zombies spawn) andEasy
- 50% chance inNormal
- 100% chance inHard

### Attacking wandering traders
Zombies target wandering traders within 35 blocks and can see traders through walls. The zombie focuses solely on the trader unless it's attacked, or if either it or the target is killed or moved out of range, or if the trader is under the invisibility status effect.

### Burning under daylight
When the sun is 15 degrees or more above the ground, zombies burn once exposed to direct sunlight. Burning is suppressed when the zombie is:

- in a sufficiently shaded area: asunlight levelof 11 or less (a 1 block roof overhang provides sufficient protection even if it would have a sunlight level of 14);
- in water;
- wearing headarmor(the helmet absorbs the damage from light but may take several day cycles to wear out completely).
- under the status effect ofFire Resistance.
- standing in cobwebs.[2]

Transparent and translucent blocks, including glass and ice, do not prevent them from burning.‌[JE  only].

If they attack an entity while burning, they may set it on fire, with a (30×regional difficulty)% chance and with a 2×floor (regional difficulty) second duration‌‌[JE  only]. If wearing armor enchanted with Thorns while burning, they may set players attacking them on fire with thorns damage alone.

### Undead
Being an undead mob, they are: 

- damaged by the status effectInstant Healthand healed by the status effectInstant Damage.
- unaffected by the status effectsRegenerationandPoison.
- ignored by thewither.
- affected by theSmiteenchantment.
- a threat toarmadillos, causing them to hide in their shell.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80]

### Picking up items
Some zombies are capable of automatically picking up dropped items that they come across. Mob heads and carved pumpkins are automatically worn on their heads. Zombies can equip armor, weapons or tools. If a zombie encounters another similar item, it may drop the previous item in favor of the new one, if:

- the new item is armor or a sword and the old item was not (for example, zombies preferswordstopickaxes, andhelmetstocarved pumpkins),
- both items are armor/swords and the new item is better damage-wise (reduces higher damage for armor, or inflicts more damage for swords),
- both items are armor/swords with the same damage reduction/infliction, the new item has NBT tags while the old does not or the new item ismoredamagedthan the old item, or
- both items arebowsand the new item has NBT tags while the old does not.

For example, a zombie can pick up a totem of undying, which cannot be retrieved by killing the zombie because that would activate the totem. However, the zombie would drop the totem in favor of a sword or armor.

Items dropped by mobs in exchange for another cannot be picked up by players or mobs for 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag), but can be picked up by hoppers.

A zombie holding a picked-up item does not despawn when left alone, similar to being name tagged.

Zombies have a higher chance of being able to pick up items in Hard difficulty.

Picked-up items do not cause the zombie to drop more experience when killed, unlike naturally-spawned gear.

### Breaking doors
Up to 10% of zombies (depending on regional difficulty) in pursuit of a target bang on closed wooden doors and on Hard (and Hardcore) difficulty can succeed in breaking them down. Otherwise, the door cracks but does not break.

A zombie choosing to break the door down instead of taking an alternative path.
The zombie also breaks down the door if the door is blocking its way. Zombies can break only the top half of a door, meaning they cannot break a door if the zombie is facing the bottom half of the door.
