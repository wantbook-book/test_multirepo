## Spawn
Diamond chickens spawn under normal chicken spawning conditions, but only with 7% chance.

## Behavior
As chickens were modified in 2.0 to display neutral behavior, diamond chickens are also neutral.

Diamond chickens lay diamonds and lapis lazuli instead of eggs like normal chickens. They also have a 5% chance to explode instead of laying an item.
