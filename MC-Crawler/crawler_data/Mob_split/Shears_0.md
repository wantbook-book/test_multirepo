Shears can be combined with another pair of shears in an anvil, preserving the enchantments of both.

### Trading
Novice-level Shepherd villagers have a 40% chance to sell shears for 2 emeralds in Java Edition. This trade is always offered in Bedrock Edition.

## Usage
### Shearing
Shears lose 1 durability when used to shear something.

Shears can be used on a sheep to remove its coat and drop 1–3 wool of the corresponding color. The same sheep can be sheared again after it eats from a grass block or short grass to regenerate its coat.

Shearing a mooshroom drops 5 mushrooms of the corresponding color and irreversibly turns it into a normal cow.

Shearing a snow golem irreversibly removes its pumpkin, dropping it and revealing its face.

Shearing either a beehive or bee nest that is full of honey makes it drop 3 honeycombs and resets it to honey level 0. The same beehive or bee nest can be sheared again if it is able to reach full honey again. If sheared by hand without a campfire below the hive or nest, all bees within exit and all nearby bees attack the offending player. 

Dispensers can use shears in any of the above listed ways, interacting with any valid block or entity in front of the dispenser's face. This decreases the shears' durability. A dispenser shearing a beehive or bee nest does not anger bees or cause them to leave even if there is not a campfire below it.

Shearing a pumpkin turns it into a carved pumpkin, dropping 4 pumpkin seeds in Java Edition or 1-3 pumpkin seeds in Bedrock Edition.

In Java Edition, shearing the tip of cave vines, kelp, weeping vines, or twisting vines stops further growth by setting its age value to 25.

‌In Java Edition 1.20.5 and Bedrock Edition 1.20.80‌[upcoming], shears can be used on a tamed wolf to remove wolf armor. Only the owner of the wolf can remove armor. 

‌In Java Edition 1.21 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.0‌[upcoming], shearing a bogged drops 2 mushrooms, which can be 2 red mushrooms, 2 brown mushrooms or one of each.
