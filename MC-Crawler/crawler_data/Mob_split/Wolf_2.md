This section describes content that may be included in Java Edition. 
This content has appeared in Java Edition 1.20.5 development versions, but the full update containing it has not been released yet.



  

This section describes an experimental feature in Bedrock Edition. 
This feature is not enabled in-game by default and requires enabling the "Armadillo and Wolf Armor" setting in the "Experiments" section in Bedrock Edition.


Using wolf armor on a wolf that the player has tamed equips it onto the wolf.

Wolf armor absorbs all damage done to the wolf with some exceptions (see the list below), until its durability runs out. When the armor absorbs damage, the wolf does not produce a hurt noise.

Wolf armor does not absorb damage dealt by the following sources:

- Drowning
- Freezing
- Suffocating
- Magic
- Thorns
- TheWithereffect
- Void
- Being outside theworld border
- Entity cramming
- The/killcommand
- Warden's sonically-charged shriek

If the owner uses shears on a wolf that is wearing armor, the armor gets unequipped from the wolf.

If a wolf dies while equipped with wolf armor, the armor is dropped.

### Breeding
Main article: Breeding
A pup sitting.
Tamed wolves at full health can be bred with any type of meat, including rotten flesh and raw chicken without causing the hunger status effect. There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the wolf does not accept meat.

The growth of pups can be slowly accelerated using any type of meat. Each use takes 10% off the remaining time to grow up. Unlike healing in Bedrock Edition, rabbit stew or any type of fish cannot be used for breeding or speeding up growth.

Breeding two wolves that recognize someone else as an owner causes the pup to also be owned by the owner of the original two wolves. If two tamed wolves have different owners, the pup is randomly assigned to one of their two owners as its permanent owner.

If the player attacks an untamed wolf and then feeds it, hearts appear as when entering breeding mode, although the wolf does not breed and remains aggressive toward the player.
