# Creeper
A creeper is a common hostile mob that quietly approaches players and then explodes, which can destroy blocks and deal massive amounts of damage. Creepers are a major source of gunpowder as well as the only way to obtain most music discs.

## Spawning
Creepers naturally spawn in the Overworld on solid blocks with a light level of 0, except in mushroom fields and deep dark biomes. They spawn individually in Bedrock Edition and in groups of up to four in Java Edition.

In Bedrock Edition, there is a density limit of five creepers in the Overworld's surface.

## Behavior
A creeper giving chase.
Creepers chase any player within a 16-block radius. They do not attack any other mob without provocation by being attacked first.

When within 3 blocks of a player, a creeper stops moving, hisses, flashes and expands, and explodes after 1.5 seconds (30 ticks), destroying (and dropping as items) blocks in the area as well as significantly damaging the player. A creeper's detonation can be halted if the player leaves the blast radius, including by knocking it back, going out of the creeper's sight, or if the creeper is killed before the explosion. Assuming the player stays within line of sight, the distance that the player must move in order for a creeper cancel its explosion is 7 blocks, regardless of difficulty. Normal creeper explosions have a power of 3.

In Java Edition, the if the game rule mobExplosionDropDecay is set to false, blocks have a 100% chance of dropping as items instead of being destroyed.

A creeper explodes only if it has an uninterrupted line of sight with the player throughout the entire 1.5-second countdown. As a result, if the creeper does not have line-of-sight with the player, it does not start hissing even at close range, even if the player is attacking it, and a detonation is canceled if it has started. The hissing sound plays in its entirety regardless of whether the explosion happens or not.

Unlike most mobs, the creeper does not have an idle sound, nor does it have unique step sounds. Although it does make normal stepping and swimming sounds, it is hard for players to distinguish those from sounds they make themselves. This makes the approach of a creeper difficult for an unwary player to notice until it starts hissing. 

A creeper jumps down to a player if it can survive the fall. A creeper taking fall damage adds to its swell according to fallDistance * 1.5, up to a maximum of 5 less than the fuse of the creeper. The creeper explodes when the swell equals the fuse, so an explosion occurs soon after landing with higher falls. For example, a creeper falling from greater than 16 blocks can explode 5 ticks after it lands. 

The amount of swell added to creepers upon falling a certain distance
Creepers can climb up ladders, vines, and similar blocks like any other mob, but do not do so intentionally. 

Using a flint and steel or fire charge‌[Java Edition  only] on a creeper forces an explosion.

In Java Edition, the detection range of creepers is reduced by 50% when the player is wearing a creeper head.

Creepers flee from ocelots and cats within a 6-block radius, with faster movement than when pursuing a player. Cats and ocelots do not attack creepers. A creeper that has begun a detonation does not flee unless the player leaves its blast radius. 

Creepers are not targeted by tamed wolves, iron golems or zoglins. However, they are still attacked by withers, snow golems,[1] vindicators named "Johnny", wardens and goats. When hit by a stray projectile (like a drowned's trident), a creeper retaliates if not already chasing a player, unless said projectile is a skeleton's arrow. If a creeper is attacked by any mob except a goat, the creeper moves toward the mob that attacked it and explodes.

When a creeper is inflicted with a status effect, its explosion creates an area effect cloud of the effect.‌[Java Edition  only]
