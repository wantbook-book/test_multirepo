#### Hunting
Piglin celebrating dance.
Piglins sometimes attack hoglins, causing other piglins and piglin brutes‌[Bedrock Edition  only] in that area to attack the targeted hoglin as well.

Adults do not immediately attack adult hoglins on sight, but a piglin has a random chance to make the decision to hunt a hoglin (this decision almost never happens if the piglin recently hunted, but other piglins can still start a hunt).[verify] Once that piglin attacks the hoglin, all other piglins and piglin brutes‌[Bedrock Edition  only] in that area become hostile to the hoglin. If outnumbered by hoglins, the piglins flee, making "retreat" sounds. After defeating a hoglin (or any other Entity), piglins have a 10% chance to do a "victory dance" by bobbing their heads and sticking out their arms like a T-pose.

The more piglins there are, the bigger chance of a hunt might happen (because a lot of piglins that saw the hoglin has a 10% chance of starting a hunt).

After a hunt, any nearby piglins pick up the porkchops or cooked porkchops the hoglin dropped but not the leather. Piglin brutes never pick up any porkchops or leather.

Piglins that spawned as part of a bastion remnant during world generation do not hunt.

Piglin brutes also join in hunts started by piglins, but do not start a hunt themselves.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

#### Being distracted
Piglins briefly stop attacking when given gold items. If the player offers a gold ingot, bartering then takes place as it normally would. They resume attacking once the barter is complete. If the player distracts them with a gold item and equips a piece of gold armor while the piglin is examining the item, then the piglin ceases hostility. They may also cease hostility if distracted enough times. If the player breaks any gold-related block or hurt/kill a piglin and then distracts the piglin up to 5 times with a piece of gold armor equipped, the piglin ceases hostility entirely.

### Bartering
Main article: Bartering
Adult piglins can trade gold ingots for certain items, when a gold ingot is dropped near them or the player uses it while looking at them. The piglin "examines" the ingot for six‌[JE  only] or eight‌[BE  only][13] seconds, then drops a random item from the chart. However, baby piglins examine the ingot and then run away without dropping an item. Piglins can also pick up items dropped by a dispenser or dropper. The pool for what piglins can barter may be modified in a data pack‌[JE  only].

Piglins can still barter while riding another mob.

### Picking up items
Piglins can pick up any items they come across, preferring gold-related items, which they actively seek out.

Each piglin has eight hidden inventory slots in which it can stack items. A piglin with a full inventory does not attempt to pick up gold-related items, except gold ingots.

#### Equipping
A piglin automatically equips any armor or weapon it can pick up, as long as the new equipment is better than its current equipment. Piglins also prefer gold over other armors.

When a piglin picks up a gold-related piece of equipment, it has to inspect the item first before equipping it. Inspecting the item takes six seconds. However, non-gold equipment, if preferrable, is equipped instantly. Piglins do not pick up any items when the /gamerule mobGriefing is set to false.

Only a piglin with a crossbow can pick up crossbows.

A piglin picks up raw porkchops and cooked porkchops from 1 block, unless it has already done so within the last 10 seconds. However, a piglin does not seek out porkchops or go out of its way to collect them.

#### Piglin loved items
Items with the piglin_loved tag are the only items that piglins want and pick up. When a piglin picks up one of these items, the player who dropped it (if it was dropped by a player) is given the advancement/achievement "O(oo)h Shiny!", unless the item was a gold nugget. Piglins aren't interested in other items, and can't be distracted by other items, even if the items are related to gold in some way.

Items that piglins love:


Bell
Block of gold
Block of raw gold
Clock
Deepslate gold ore

Baby piglins attempt to pick up every item, regardless of whether they love it, and they admire gold ingots or barter any items.

Adult piglins can pick up gold nuggets, but won't inspect them for bartering. (they do not actively seek out and contemplate porkchops). When killed, a piglin drops all of its items, except for gold ingots, raw porkchops, and cooked porkchops.
