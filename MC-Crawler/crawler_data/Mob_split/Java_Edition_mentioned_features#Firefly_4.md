#### Ambient mobs
In 2012, Jon Kågström mentioned fish, birds, and other tree animals, to "make the game seem more alive".[55] Parrots and four different fish mobs were added in 2017 and 2018, respectively.

#### Prefix mobs
Notch mentioned prefix mobs in a Brocraft stream. He gave examples of mobs such as "Burning Spiders, Giant Zombies, and Cobble Creepers." Some prefix mobs have been added in the form of cave spiders, charged creepers, strays, husks, drowned, and other mob variants. Giant zombies have technically been added, but are currently unused. In the 3D Shareware April Fools update, the ORDER.txt jokingly mentions "11 new enemy variants including Buff Crepper and Evilshroom II" for a fake game: "MineCraft 3D: Deeper and darker."

#### Lava zombie and troll
Before the implementation of hostile mobs, Notch stated that he liked the idea of monsters such as lava zombies or troll infestations which would roam the land and break things. Later, the zombie was implemented.[56]

#### Reindeer
Reindeer were another mob acknowledged and suggested initially for Christmas 2015.[57] Minecraft Earth version 0.6.0 added the Jolly Llama, which is supposed to represent a reindeer. It is currently unknown if reindeer will one day be added to Minecraft or not.

#### Camouflaging mob
A mob which camouflages with its environment was a concept considered by Jeb when designing the shulker, which was originally one of the mob's mechanics during development - the mob would camouflage with the surroundings, but due to difficulties with the code and rendering, he decided to abandon this element of the mob. He stated however that it may happen in the future.[58]

#### Illager variants
In 2017, a jocular suggestion regarding adding more types of illagers was posted. One of them, the pillager, has been implemented in Java Edition 1.14. In Minecraft Dungeons, there is a mob known as the iceologer, known internally as the Chillager. This mob was also part of the 2020 mob vote.[59][60][61][62]

#### More ocean creatures
Notch commented that sea monsters were a possibility on Minecast on July 21, 2010.[citation needed] He particularly noted the possibility of sharks, though Mojang has since then denied that they will be added. Hostile aquatic mobs like the guardian and drowned have been added since then. A more recent developer hinted about adding mobs involved adding seals/sea lions and/or orcas.[63] This may be related to dolphins, which were added about a month later in 18w15a.

#### Soul fire blazes
Soul Fire Blazes were talked about by Jeb. He stated that he doesn't want to make another mob variant, but that it would be interesting to make a mob connected to soul fire.[64] In Minecraft Live 2023 it was mentioned that in 1.21 a blue mob named breeze with similar visual design will be added.[65]

#### Snails
Snails were mentioned by Xilefian, in the context of how he would hypothetically implement them. He would make their design a cube "the shape and size of a player's head, like a mini shulker"; unlike a shulker, only the shell would be visible, and it would have solid collision and require a pickaxe to mine. It is currently unknown if this mob will be added.

### Biomes and environment
#### Audio loops
Main article: Ambience § Audio loops
Loops were unused sounds, found in the game files, and were possibly meant for when the player is in a specific type of location (i.e., in caves, forests, the ocean, or beside a waterfall).

#### Seasons
Dinnerbone mentioned on Twitter that he was experimenting with adding seasons, and varying the length of day and night according to season. He also mentioned it during Minecon 2013.[67][68] Seasons may include changes in color of tree leaves and may also be tied to real time.[69][70] The later released Minecraft Dungeons has a location called Pumpkin Pastures, which resembles an autumn-themed forest biome. Autumn-colored trees also appear in forest biomes in Minecraft Legends.

#### Trees
Several features regarding trees have been mentioned throughout the game's history.

Notch mentioned branches in a blog post during Indev. The addition of sideways logs seems to be an alternative for branches.[71] Implemented on chorus trees, acacia trees and cherry trees, but not on ordinary trees.

Two tree species were mentioned at the biome vote for MINECON 2018 called the palm and baobab. However, both trees' host biomes were voted against and the trees have yet to appear in-game despite being promised implementation later.

#### Cave and underground features
Many features relating to the underground and caves have been mentioned historically, but are yet to be seen in-game. Some suggestions which were approved by Mojang include rainbow crystalline caves[72] and cave maps, considered "an interesting idea" by Notch.[73] 1.13 added buffet worlds, which has an option for cave-like generation.

More ores and cave types was a general target proposed by Dinnerbone in late 2013.[74] Since this post, flooded underwater caves have been implemented, along with 1.16 adding ancient debris and nether gold ore, and 1.17 adding copper ore and amethyst.

In Minecraft Live 2020, Caves & Cliffs update was announced, bringing more new types of caves.

#### Nether features
Multiple features relating to the Nether have been proposed and acknowledged, such as utilizing the space above the Nether ceiling for something else,[75] non-rectangular nether portals,[76] and nether portals placing players in front if possible.[77]

During the development of the Nether Update, other ideas were discussed, such as dyeable nether portals, which were dismissed as not being priority by Jeb.[78] As a joke feature in Java Edition 20w14∞, funky portals were added and would change color depending on the text data found in a written book.
