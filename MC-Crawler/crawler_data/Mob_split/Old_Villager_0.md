# Villager (old)
Villagers are passive mobs that inhabit villages, work at their professions, breed, and interact with each other. Their clothing varies according to their occupation. A player can trade with villagers, using emeralds as currency. Villagers received a complete overhaul of both their appearance and their functionality in the Village & Pillage update; this page covers villagers as they appeared and behaved before the update.

## Spawning
### Spawn eggs
In Bedrock Edition, the old villager spawn egg can still be obtained by /give spawn_egg 1 15. Using that spawn egg spawns an old villager with 0 health, which means it dies immediately upon spawning. A new villager spawns after it dies.

### Natural generation
In Java Edition, old villagers can only spawn in versions of Minecraft prior to 1.14. In Bedrock Edition, old villagers can only spawn if they existed from a template world prior to 1.11.0, and any old villager spawned after 1.11.0 outside a template world is converted into villager_v2.

### Baby villagers
Villagers breed autonomously, but need doors and need to be willing in order to spawn baby villagers. After exactly 20 minutes during which the baby villager is within render distance, the baby villager grows up to an adult. See this section for more information.

### Curing
Villagers spawn if a player uses a splash potion of weakness on a v1 zombie villager in template world and then feeds it a regular golden apple. It then shakes and turn into a villager within 0-5 minutes. During the change, the zombie villager can still burn in the sun.

## Drops
Villagers drop nothing upon death.

Trade: 3–6 xp
Trade while willing: 8–11 xp

## Behavior
### Movement patterns
Upon spawning, villagers leave their homes and begin to explore the village. Generally, they wander aimlessly inside the village during the day. They may go indoors or outdoors, and they periodically make mumbling sounds. Occasionally, two villagers may stop and turn to look at each other, in a behavior called socializing, in which they stare at another villager for 4-5 seconds at a time. In the case of players, they continuously stare at them as long as the player is close enough, unless the villager tries to get into a house at night, farm food, or flee from a zombie.

In Legacy Console Edition, when a player attacks a villager, the villager does not run away, but anger particles fly out from the villager if it is in a village. In Bedrock Edition, villagers do not stop continuously in front of players. They also sprint away if the player attacks them.

Villagers, like other mobs, find paths around obstructions, avoiding walking off cliffs and some blocks that cause harm. However, in crowded situations it is possible for one villager to push another off a cliff or into harm. Villagers also occasionally walk off of ledges high enough to cause fall damage.

At night or during rain, villagers run inside, closing doors behind them, and staying indoors until morning. In the morning they head outside and resume normal behavior.

Villagers flee from zombies, illagers and vexes within 8 blocks.

If a villager finds itself outside the village boundary, or a villager without a village detects a village boundary within 32 blocks, it moves quickly back within the boundary. A villager taken more than 32 blocks away from its village boundary forgets the village within about 6 seconds. Whether in a village or not, a villager is never prone to despawning.

Villagers cannot open trapdoors, fence gates, or iron doors.

There is evidence that villagers are prone to overcrowding certain areas of a village while leaving other areas completely empty. When moving inside, the AI prefers doors within 16 blocks (Euclidean distance). It also tends to prefer doors with fewer villagers nearby, however "nearby" in this case is only 1.5 blocks and, when moving inside, villagers prefer to move 2.5 blocks inside when the inside is to the south or east and therefore go out of range of this check. During the day, it has been observed that villagers tend to cluster near a trapped villager or any existing large cluster of villagers, likely due to the "socialize" AI routine overriding their inclination to wander.

### Picking up items
Villagers have eight hidden inventory slots, which start empty whenever the villager is spawned. Villagers do not intentionally seek out items to pick up, but they collect any bread, carrots, potatoes, wheat, seeds, beetroot and beetroot seeds they happen to come within range of. These are the only items they are able to pick up, though the player may use the /replaceitem command to put an arbitrary item into a villager's inventory. If a player and a villager are in the pickup range of an item at the same time, the player always picks it up first.

Even when gamerule keepInventory is set to false, villagers that are killed with any of the available items above do not drop them once they are killed.

Any items in these slots are lost if a villager becomes a zombie villager; a zombie villager has no inventory slots.

If /gamerule mobGriefing is false, villagers do not pick up items.

A dispenser can be used, if adjacent to a villager, to place armor on it. While not visible in most cases (other than pumpkins and mob heads) the equipment is fully functional; for example, the Thorns enchantment hurts zombies that attack a villager with a piece of armor enchanted with the Thorns enchantment equipped.
