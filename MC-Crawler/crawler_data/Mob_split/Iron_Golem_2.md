#### Provocation by other mobs


Although they are guardians of villages, iron golems are not actually provoked when a mob attacks a nearby villager (in contrast to a player attacking a villager). With the exception of creepers and goats, they are provoked when attacked by any mobs, and by the presence of nearby monsters. Even if a witch accidentally throws a positive splash potion at an iron golem during a raid, this does not stop the iron golem from attacking the witch. Iron golems are ineffective against flying hostile mobs that don't venture into the iron golem's reach, such as ghasts and phantoms.

The list below contains mobs that can have hostile interactions with iron golems. The iron golem also attacks neutral mobs or hostile mobs that attack the player such as piglins or zombified piglins.

An iron golem looks down at a husk, but cannot attack the husk.
A naturally-spawned iron golem knows where raiding illager locations are from behind solid walls and from underground and attempts to move toward them. An iron golem created by the player or summoned by a command cannot detect raiders through obstructions. Iron golems also looks down or looks up if the hostile mob is above or below the iron golem.

### Being attacked
Zombies (and variants), zoglins, skeletons (and variants), spiders, cave spiders, slimes, magma cubes, withers, ravagers and illagers naturally attack iron golems on sight and may cause major damage, especially if the mobs attack in groups. In Bedrock Edition, silverfish and witches also naturally attack iron golems without provocation.

Iron golems have 100% knockback resistance from normal attacks. They can still be knocked back by the Knockback enchantment on swords and the Punch enchantment on bows.‌[Java Edition  only]
