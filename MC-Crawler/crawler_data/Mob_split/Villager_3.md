### Breeding
For tutorials on breeding mechanics, see Tutorials/Village mechanics § Breeding and population cap and Tutorials/Legacy Console village mechanics.

Adult villagers breed depending on the time of the day and need to be willing to spawn § Baby villagers, who also require beds with at least 2 empty blocks above the head. Job sites are not required for villagers to breed.

The breeding depends on the number of valid beds. If a villager is "willing" (see § Willingness below), villagers breed as long as there are unclaimed beds available within the limits of the village. All baby villagers are initially unemployed.

In Java Edition, two villagers nearby one another periodically enter mating mode if both have enough food and are not on cooldown. Breeding fails (with anger particles displayed) if no unclaimed bed can be reached via pathfinding within a 48 block radius. The appearance of the child is randomly determined by either the biome type of the parents or by the biome where the breeding occurred.

In Bedrock Edition a census is periodically taken to determine the current population of the village. All villagers within the horizontal boundary of the village are counted as part of the population to determine if continued villager mating is allowed. However, any villager within the horizontal boundary of the village and the spherical boundary of the village attempts to enter mating mode as long as there is at least one villager within the boundary. If two villagers simultaneously enter mating mode while they are close to one another, they breed and produce a child. The appearance is determined by the biome where the breeding occurs in Bedrock Edition.[6]

#### Willingness
Villagers must be willing to breed. Willingness is determined by the amount of food items a villager has. Becoming willing consumes the villager's food stock, therefore, after mating, villagers cease to be willing until they gather a sufficient stock of food items and breed again.

Villagers must have enough beds within village bounds for baby villagers to spawn. The villager must be able to path-find the bed from their current position. (Note that mobs view slabs as full blocks for pathfinding, so putting upper half slabs above a bed invalidates the bed.)

Villagers can become willing by having either 3 bread, 12 carrots, 12 potatoes, or 12 beetroots in one slot in their inventory. Any villager with an excess of food (usually farmers) throws food to other villagers, allowing them to pick it up and obtain enough food to become willing. The player can also throw bread, carrots, beetroots, or potatoes at the villagers themselves to encourage breeding. Villagers consume the required food upon becoming willing. If /gamerule mobGriefing is false, villagers don't pick up food or break crops.

### Baby villagers
Baby villagers sprint around, entering and leaving houses at will. They sometimes stop sprinting to stare at other villagers,‌[Java Edition  only] the player, or an iron golem. If the iron golem is holding out a poppy, the children may cautiously take the flower from its hands. This is a reference to the 1986 Japanese animated movie Castle in the Sky, in which a giant robot covered in vines (inspiration for the iron golem) gives the main characters flowers to put on a memorial.[7] Baby villagers tend to group and chase one another around the village as if playing tag. They also jump on beds.

Illagers (except "Johnny" vindicators in Bedrock Edition) ignore baby villagers until they reach adulthood.

Baby villagers give gifts of poppies or wheat seeds to players who have the Hero of the Village effect in Java Edition. 

Baby villagers in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education have a slightly bigger head than in Java Edition; this also can be seen in other baby mobs in the game as well. Java Edition baby villagers don't have too big of a head, so they look like a tiny normal villager.[8]

Baby villagers can fit through 1×1 block gaps.

A baby villager becomes an adult 20 minutes after birth, even when in a boat or a minecart. Baby villagers with no AI do not grow up.

### Lightning
A villager gets struck by lightning.
When lightning strikes within 3–4 blocks of a villager, the villager is replaced by a witch that can't despawn. Even a baby villager that is struck by lightning is turned into a two-block-tall witch. 

Iron golems also attack any villagers that turn into witches.

### Iron golem summoning

Main article: Iron Golem § Villages
In Java Edition, 3 or 5 villagers can summon an iron golem to protect themselves from hostile mobs.

In Bedrock Edition, villagers can summon an iron golem if there are less than 10 villagers per existing golem and the village has at least 20 beds.

### Panicking
Villagers sometimes panic during a raid or a zombie siege by emitting water particles and shaking.

In Java Edition, villagers panic if they see a mob that is hostile toward villagers, like a zombie, zombie villager, husk, drowned, zoglin, illager, vex, wither, or ravager and flee frantically from them, sometimes hiding in houses. In Bedrock Edition, villagers panic by running around in circles around a bed in a village house, such as when a raid happens or when the player rings the village bell. Java Edition villagers in panic are more likely to summon iron golems. To see these mobs, the villager must have an unobstructed line of sight to it (eye-level to eye-level), and be within a certain range (spherical distance between feet center bottom-most point of the villager and hostile mob):

| Mob                                         | Panic radius |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Zombie, husk, drowned, zombie villager, vex | 8            |
| Vindicator, zoglin                          | 10           |
| Evoker, illusioner, ravager                 | 12           |
| Pillager                                    | 15           |
