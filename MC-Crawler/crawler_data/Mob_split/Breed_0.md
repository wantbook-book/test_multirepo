## Mechanics
A cow following the player.
Most animals that can be bred have a food item used to lead and breed it (there are a few special cases, described below). Once an animal notices a player holding its food, it follows the player until either the player is out of range, the player stops holding the item, it begins the breeding process, or it is attacked. Baby animals behave the same way. Most animals are uninterested in food lying on the ground, and those that are do not breed from eating this food; animals breed only when fed by a player. One item per parent is needed to breed a single baby.

### Love mode
When an animal is fed its food, it enters "love mode", preparing to breed with another animal of the same species that is also in love mode. Animals that are in love mode emit heart particles constantly. When both animals are fed, they pathfind toward each other, up to eight blocks away. The two animals walk into each other for about two and a half seconds, and then drop 1–7 and end love mode to produce their offspring, the method of which depends on the animal. Most animals immediately spawn a baby animal at the feet of the parents, usually of the same species as their parents, with the exception of mules, which cannot breed with each other and must be bred via the union of a horse and donkey. Some animals lay eggs, but the method and location they perform this varies from animal to animal. Chickens are the only animals that can both directly produce babies and lay eggs, as well as the only animals that lay eggs without being fed. After breeding, the parents cannot be fed to breed again for five minutes, but they (and their babies) always follow players holding breeding items. An animal exits love mode if it does not breed 30 seconds after being fed, but it immediately becomes able to be fed and enter love mode again.

The number of animals that are produced starting from a single pair of animals, assuming the offspring is fully grown before breeding again, is represented by this sequence: (OEIS A061418)

a1=2a2=3a3=4a4=6a5=9a6=13a7=19⋮an+1=⌊32an⌋⋮

where ⌊x⌋ is the floor function.

The nth term of the sequence can also be computed with this formula: an=⌈K×(3/2)n⌉ where K=1.08151366859... and ⌈x⌉ is the ceiling function. The constant K is defined to be (2/3)×K(3) (see OEIS A083286)
