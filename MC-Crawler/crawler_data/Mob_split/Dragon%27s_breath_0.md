## Obtaining
### Harvesting
The dragon's breath can be obtained by scooping up the ender dragon's breath attack or the purple effect clouds caused by dragon fireballs in an empty glass bottle.

## Usage
### Brewing ingredient
Dragon's breath may be added to any splash potion to upgrade it to a lingering potion, which can be used to create a lasting area effect cloud, or to craft tipped arrows.

With two or more dragon's breath in the brewing stand, after the brewing process, a glass bottle drops as an entity. However, with one dragon's breath in the brewing stand, the glass bottle is consumed and cannot be retrieved.[1]
