### Riding
Main article: Riding
Once a horse is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse. The player dismounts using the dismount control. Like riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a horse.

A ridden saddled horse automatically runs up any one block high slope. The horse and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high. Lower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block. The horse itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks. Horses cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.

The maximum speed of horses varies between 4.74 blocks/second and 14.23 blocks/second (compared to the player's walking speed, which is about 4.317 blocks/second). About 82% of horses are able to go faster than a minecart. Horses move backward slowly, about as fast as the player when moving sideways. A horse’s speed can also be affected by potions. Speed has no relation to a horse’s outward appearance.

A ridden saddled horse can be made to jump by pressing the jump control. Holding the jump control fills a jump charge bar allowing for a higher jump when released relative to how much the bar was filled. In Java Edition, when the player rides a horse, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by a jump bar and the player's hunger bar is replaced by the horse's health bar. In Bedrock Edition, the player's health bar and hunger bar are displayed while riding a horse and the player's experience bar is replaced by the horse's jump bar when the jump control is activated. During the jump control activation the number denoting the player's experience level is still displayed above the jump bar. Horses are not affected by jump boost beacons.

## Behavior

Horses wander aimlessly, occasionally stopping to rear, flick their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass. Unlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed. If a player comes near, the horses may turn to look at them. Any horse, even a wild or undead horse, can be attached to a lead without protest, although an untamed horse rears and flails its forelegs if saddled. Horses remain passive, even when hit.

Horses make neighing and whinnying sounds.

Adult horses cannot ride a boat; foals, however, can.

Unlike other passive mobs, horses slowly regenerate health.

Horses can be led by a player holding a golden carrot, golden apple, or enchanted golden apple. Baby horses follow adult horses.

### Taming
Taming a horse is required to breed it, to give it equipment, or to control it while riding.

In Java Edition, a player mounts a horse by pressing use on it with an empty hand. In Bedrock Edition, the player can also hold an object that cannot be used on a horse. A player tames an adult horse by repeatedly mounting it until the horse stops bucking off the player. Taming depends on the horse's "temper". Horses begin with a temper of 0 out of 100. When a player first mounts the horse, a random taming threshold 0–99 is chosen. The horse becomes tame if the temper exceeds this threshold. Otherwise, the player is bucked off and the temper is increased by 5, to be compared against the threshold the next time the player mounts the horse. Temper can also be increased by feeding the horse.

After repeated mountings, hearts appear above the horse, indicating that it is tamed.

In Bedrock Edition, like all tame animals, when a horse is killed, a death message is displayed to every player.

### Breeding
Feeding two tamed horses golden apples or golden carrots activates love mode, causing them to mate and produce a foal. The foal appears more spindly than adult horses and grows in stages to full size with time. The foal can be fed to make it mature faster.

Depending on the variations of the parent horses, the offspring can be one of several types. 

- Bred with a horse:breedingtwo horses produces a horse foal. Usually, the new foal has the color and markings of one of its parents, although there is a13⁄45chance of having a random color/markings (which may still end up being the same as one of the parents).
- Bred with adonkey: cross-breeding a horse with a donkey creates amulefoal. Mules cannot breed. This unlocks theArtificial Selectionachievement.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

This is a table representing the probabilities of the color and markings of the foal when breeding two horses A and B.
