## Behavior
Fireballs have a straight trajectory unaffected by gravity and a theoretically infinite range. Fireballs can be deflected if hit with another projectile or a melee attack, sending them in the direction of the player's head.

Fireballs create an explosion upon impact with an entity or block, setting fire to nearby blocks. Fireballs shot by ghasts have an explosive force of 1. The minimum blast resistance required to absorb all blast force of a fireball is 4.034. However, blocks with resistance as low as 3.5 survive if hit.

At close range, fireballs deal massive damage; a direct hit deals 6 projectile damage and up to to 9, 17 × 8.5, or 25 × 12.5 explosion damage from the blast depending on difficulty. If an entity has the Fire Resistance effect or is naturally resistant to fire, a fireball does not deal projectile damage to them, although the explosion still can inflict damage. Fireballs rebounded by the player deal 1000 × 500 damage to a ghast upon direct hit, killing them. Fireballs only damage ghasts when rebounded by the player or if the explosion is within a certain range of a ghast. Fireballs are generally incapable of dealing explosion damage to ghasts from the sides or above, and an explosion is most likely to deal damage from below or within a ghast.

When a player hits a fireball, only the projectile damage dealt by the fireball counts as the player's kill.

If a ghast is killed, any remaining fireballs launched by that ghast disappear.

When two fireballs collide, one is deflected in a random direction[verify] while the other explodes upon impact.
