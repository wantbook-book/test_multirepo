## Behavior
Zombified piglins wander aimlessly about when idle. They move at 2.28 m/s and are immune to fire and lava. When provoked, their speed increases to 3.38 m/s or faster for babies.

In Java Edition, like zombies, zombified piglins can attack wooden doors and may break them on Hard difficulty.[2]

In Normal and Hard difficulties, up to 55%‌[JE  only] or 25%‌[BE  only] of zombified piglins pick up any armor pieces and swords better than their golden one, which they always drop when killed. This also prevents them from despawning. 

Zombified piglins may pick up an illager banner next to it‌[BE  only] as pillagers do.[3]

Zombified piglins try to destroy any turtle eggs they see within 23 blocks away horizontally and 3 blocks away vertically (10 blocks horizontally and 2 blocks vertically in Bedrock Edition), not counting the block they are standing in. When a zombified piglin is first spawned, it always detects nearby turtle eggs after exactly 2 seconds, as long as there are two blocks of air above it. However, if the turtle egg is placed after the zombified piglin spawned, the zombified piglin takes some time to notice the turtle egg and try to break it.

Zombified piglins avoid walking near magma blocks and cannot jump over magma blocks one block high. If a zombified piglin is surrounded by magma block wall one block height or higher, it gets near those surrounding magma blocks surrounding them. If a zombified piglin spawns on or is pushed onto magma blocks, it pathfinds normally on the magma.

Zombified piglins do not retreat from zoglins, soul torches/lanterns, soul fire or soul campfires. Zoglins attack zombified piglins on sight, causing a retaliation.

Zombified piglins are not distracted by gold, and cannot barter, unlike piglins. They also do not follow players that are holding a gold ingot or another gold item.

Villagers and wandering traders run away from zombified piglins, despite them being passive to villagers and wandering traders.‌[BE  only] In addition, piglins squeal in distress and flee from zombified piglins if they get too close. Zombified piglins ignore piglins unless provoked.

Iron golems attack zombified piglins, which causes other zombified piglins to attack the iron golem. A zombified piglin is neutral to every mob that can attack, but they retaliate and gang up on any mob that provokes them.

### Mob type
Being an undead mob, they are: 

- damaged by the status effectInstant Healthand healed by the status effectInstant Damage.
- unaffected by the status effectsRegenerationandPoison.
- ignored by thewither.
- affected by theSmiteenchantment.
- unable to swim inwater, but do not drown.
- a threat toarmadillos, causing them to hide in their shell.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80]
