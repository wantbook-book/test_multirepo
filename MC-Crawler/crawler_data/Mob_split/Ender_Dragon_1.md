### Movement
The ender dragon is a flying mob, which cannot actually stand on the ground. It flies around the end main island while fighting the player.

The dragon can pass through all blocks, destroying almost all types of them, but can still be affected by flowing water, lava and bubble column. Blocks not destroyed are those that naturally generate on the central End island, such as end stone, and those that are intended to be indestructible, such as bedrock.

In Java Edition, these blocks are marked under the dragon_immune tag, with the exception of light blocks and fire, which are marked as dragon_transparent.

Destroyed blocks are not dropped, although containers (such as chests and dispensers, but not shulker boxes) drop their contents.

### Attacking
The dragon performing its toxic breath attack.
The dragon never targets any entity but the player, although other mobs may turn hostile to the dragon when hit, and the dragon may sometimes retaliate against other mobs if it takes damage to a projectile. Any entities hit by its wings are dealt 5 damage (or 10 damage if hit by its head), and in Java Edition, are thrown into the air, sometimes to fatal heights or even off the island. Neither of these effects is applied for 1⁄2 second after the dragon takes damage.

The ender dragon has four main states of behavior: 

Guarding
- The dragon begins in this state, circling the ring of obsidian pillars on either the outside if there are still end crystals or the inside if the crystals are destroyed.
- With each crystal's destruction, it takes damage and there is an increased chance of the dragon switching states.

Targeting
Whenever the dragon finds itself less than 10 blocks or more than 150 blocks from its current target, it attempts to choose a new target. When damaged it targets a point just behind itself, causing it to turn away and choose a new target.
Strafing
- Upon the destruction of an end crystal, the dragon switches to strafing. As soon as it is within 64 blocks, it shoots afireballat the player.
- The dragon resumes circling after this state.

Diving
- The dragon dives onto the target player's position, taken at the start of the dive. The dragon never seems to perform this attack mid-flight in game, it only seems to do it when exiting the portal.
- The dragon resumes circling after this state, whether or not it actually hit the player.

Perching
- While Guarding and the dragon has reached the end of the path, it has 1 in (3 + crystals alive) chance (~7.7% up to 33%) to go to the exit portal structure (approaching from the side opposite the player if possible) and lands on the highest block of the coordinates (X=0, Z=0), up to (Y=101).‌[Bedrock Edition  only]If there is no block in (X=0, Z=0) the dragon freezes right when it switches to perching.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]The dragon is immune to arrows in this state; they all catch fire and bounce off. InJava Editionit is also immune to thrown tridents in this state.

Dragon's breath
Unless the player is in Peaceful difficulty, after 1.25 seconds, if a player is within 20 blocks of the exit portal structure, the dragon roars and use its 3-second breath attack, damaging players similarly to a lingering potion of Harming. An area of visible particles in the shape of a horizontal disc one block tall and 5 to 6 blocks in diameter appears where the breath attack strikes, either on the ground or floating in the air, at whatever point the breath attack struck a block. The harming effect zone where the player takes damage is confined to a smaller area in the center this visible cloud, covering about 3 to 4 blocks.
The harming effect portion of the purple clouds emitted from the dragon's breath attack can be collected in a glass bottle to obtain dragon's breath. Each bottle of dragon's breath collected removes one block from the lingering damage zone of the breath attack. The visible clouds remain for 3 seconds whether the dragons breath is bottled or not. By rapidly collecting all of the harmful blocks, usually around three, even a direct hit from the breath attack can be mostly and even entirely negated before the player suffers any damage.
Charge
If the player is not near the portal within 5 seconds of the dragon's landing, it charges at players within 150 blocks.
Take-off
After four consecutive breath attacks, or if the dragon fails to locate a player within 150 blocks, it takes off from its perch. It always takes off in Peaceful difficulty, making it difficult to land melee hits.
The dragon resumes circling after this state.
Escape
If cumulative damage taken while perched exceeds 50 × 25, the dragon takes off and resets the damage accumulator. The accumulator is not reset if it does not take enough damage.
The dragon resumes circling after this state.
In Java Edition, when the dragon finally takes a fatal blow, it flies toward the exit portal structure before dying, unless it cannot find it within 150 blocks, or it is inside blocks.
