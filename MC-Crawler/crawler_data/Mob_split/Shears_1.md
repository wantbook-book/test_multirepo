### Breaking blocks
Shears use 1 durability when is used to break any block, even if it breaks instantly by hand.

Shears can be used to harvest cobwebs, leaves, short grass, seagrass, ferns, dead bushes, nether sprouts, vines, glow lichen or hanging roots and obtain them in item form. If used to break tall grass, tall seagrass or large ferns, 2 units of the respective small plant are dropped instead. Shears can also be used to break tripwire connected to a tripwire hook without activating it.

When shears are used to break weeping vines or twisting vines they are guaranteed to drop in item form instead of the usual 33% chance. This applies to vines directly broken by shears and not vines that are broken due to the destruction of their supporting vines.

The following table shows information about blocks that can be broken with shears. Colors indicate what gets dropped when the block is broken:

- White: The original block.
- Blue: The block's normal drop (i.e. string, sticks, seeds, saplings, apples).
- Yellow: two units of the corresponding small plant (short grass, seagrass, or ferns)
- Red: Nothing.
