## Reupload
Beta 1.4 was reuploaded around an hour and a half after its initial release. The later version removed a small unused section of code added in the initial version which tracks the player's walking distance in memory, presumably testing code accidentally left in the game for Beta 1.5, which added statistics â€“ namely, a statistic that tracks how many meters the player has walked.
