####  Flammable blocks
Fire can spread onto and burn away any flammable block (or in the case of TNT, ignite it). On the other hand, a fire that is not adjacent to any flammable block and not on top of a forever-burning block does not spread, even to another flammable block within the normal range.

In the following table, the higher the ignite odds, the more quickly a block catches fire if the fire is available to spread there. The higher the burn odds, the more quickly a block on fire burns away. These are relative values; actual ignite odds and burn time depends not only on these values, but on difficulty, rain, the age of the fire, the direction of the block relative to the fire, and multiple random values including how long the fire waits between block ticks and further checks based on the previous factors. Fire spread is reduced if it tries to spread to a block more two blocks higher than itself. Fire spread is further reduced by 50% if the flammable blocks in a humid biome (swamp, mushroom fields and jungle, excluding sparse jungle).

#### Non-flammable blocks
Non-flammable blocks can be lit but do not burn away, and such fire does not spread. Non-flammable blocks other than netherrack or magma blocks extinguish themselves quickly. In the End, bedrock also does not extinguish itself.

If a block is a part of a flammable material, it catches fire from lava. However, certain blocks do not burn away:

### Extinguishing
Fire burns out after a while when on a non-flammable block other than netherrack or magma blocks; however, punching or hitting the side of a burning block extinguishes the fire on that side, making the Fire extinguished sound (see below). Hitting fire while holding a tool does not reduce the tool's durability. Placing blocks on the fire also extinguishes it. Water and lava extinguish fires that they flow into, and thrown splash and lingering water bottles extinguish fires in the block hit and the four blocks horizontally surrounding it.

Mobs on fire are extinguished when in water or in a cauldron containing it. In the latter case, one layer of water disappears.

Fire extinguishes more quickly if nothing flammable is present, and soon after it consumes a flammable block immediately beneath it.

- Fire has anageproperty that determines how it extinguishes, ranging from age 0 when the fire is set, and growing to age 15. For fire older than age 3, if nothing flammable is adjacent to the fire, or if the block below doesn't have a solid top surface, the fire is extinguished by the nextblock tick. At age 15, as long as there isn't a flammable block below the fire, a block tick has a1⁄4chance to extinguish the fire.

If a fire is exposed to rain, it extinguishes quickly.

- Rain affects fire if it falls directly onto the fire, or into the four adjacent blocks. Specifically, no matter the age, any block tick has a 20–65% chance of rain extinguishing the fire, depending on the fire's age: 20 percent plus 3 percentage points per age of the fire.

Fire burning on netherrack creates a perpetually burning fire.
