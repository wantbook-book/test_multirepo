## Spawning
Ray Tracing can be allowed into the world by activating the vote minecraft:ray_tracing and waiting for the message "Ray Tracing has joined the game".

## Behavior
Throwing a splash bottle of ray tracing at any mob can disguise it as Ray Tracing.

Ray Tracing wanders randomly in the world, sending random chat messages to the player. Upon death, Ray Tracing sends a random chat message.

When the vote minecraft:ray_tracing is repealed, "Ray Tracing has left the game" is sent on the chat and the entity despawns.

### Chat messages
When the entity has initially spawned, Ray Tracing sends a spawn message after between 4 and 30 seconds. Idle messages are sent in intervals of between 30 and 180 seconds.

| 1  | I just found diamonds! Wait, no, it's just coal. Again                              |
| 2  | I'm a master builder. I built a dirt house once                                     |
| 3  | Creepers? Never heard of 'em                                                        |
| 4  | I could've sworn I put that torch there                                             |
| 5  | If at first you don't succeed, dig straight down                                    |
| 6  | I'm not lost, I'm just exploring                                                    |
| 7  | Is it just me, or do those cows have judgmental eyes?                               |
| 8  | I've never been to the Nether, but I hear it's a nice place to vacation             |
| 9  | I heard if you punch trees long enough, they turn into diamonds                     |
| 10 | I'm not lost, I'm just temporarily misplaced                                        |
| 11 | I like my Minecraft like I like my coffee: with extra sugar cubes                   |
| 12 | I heard that if you stare at a pig long enough, it will give you its best pork chop |
| 13 | I'm convinced that creepers were invented by the developers just to mess with us    |
| 14 | Why build a fancy castle when you can watch a video of someone else building one?   |
