## Behavior
Cats are immune to fall damage, but they still avoid falling off cliffs high enough to normally cause fall damage.

Cats can see players even if they have the Invisibility status effect. With the exception of a faster movement rate, kittens have the same behavior as adults. They hiss at phantoms that are currently pursuing a player.‌[JE  only] Creepers and phantoms avoid cats, even while pursuing a player, keeping a distance of 6 and 16 blocks away respectively from any cats. However, a creeper that has begun its detonation does not flee unless the player leaves its blast radius.

### Stray cat
A stray cat is an untamed cat. Naturally spawned cats always spawn as stray cats. Unlike untamed wolves, stray cats may despawn naturally. They pursue and attack rabbits and baby turtles up to a distance of 15 blocks. They flee if a player or another mob approaches. Even though they spawn in villages, they don't necessarily remain there; instead, they explore.

They sprint away from any player within 7 blocks (unless the player is sneaking‌[BE  only] or difficulty is set to peaceful‌[JE  only]), and avoid players within 16 blocks. However, they slowly approach a player holding raw cod or salmon within 10 blocks, allowing the player to feed and tame it (see § Taming below). If the player turns too quickly or stops holding the fish within 6 blocks, the cat flees and does not attempt to approach the player for a few seconds.

Stray cats can be leashed.

### Tamed cat
Cats sitting on a lime bed.
Unless commanded to sit (see § Taming below), tamed cats do not remain still for long and explore around the player.

A cat not already sitting attempts to get on top of chests, the foot part of beds, or active furnaces at the cat's current Y-level within a 4-block-radius square horizontally, and once on top often assumes a sitting position without a command from the player. A cat also occasionally attempts to sit on these blocks if the blocks are at ground level. A chest with a cat sitting on top of it becomes unusable unless the cat is commanded to stand.
Cats that sit on their own can be ordered to stand, or they may get up if the player holds a raw fish nearby. The cat can also be brought down by removing the block or pushing it off. A cat does not sit on a block that is obstructed by another block above it. A cat can also be forcibly moved by attacking it, and while fleeing for some time, it sporadically sits and stands before finally staying put.

Like other mobs, cats enter nearby boats, trapping themselves.

If a player is harmed by a hostile mob or a harming potion, but not by environmental damage, a cat sitting in proximity to the player stands, moves a few blocks from its sitting location and then resumes sitting.

### Gifts
When the player sleeps, tamed cats move toward their owner and sleep near them. When the player wakes, their tamed cats also wake. There is a 70% chance for a tamed cat to give the player a gift after they wake up, but only if the player sleeps at night (if the player sleeps during a thunderstorm during the daytime, or if the tamed cat has been ordered to sit, the player receives no gift). The gift is a dropped item from the cat_morning_gift.json loot table:

| Gift             | Weight    | Chance | 1 in ...     |
|------------------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Rabbit's foot    | 10 (5⁄31) | 16.13% | 6.2          |
|                  |           |        | Rabbit hide  |
|                  |           |        | String       |
|                  |           |        | Rotten flesh |
|                  |           |        | Feather      |
|                  |           |        | Raw chicken  |
| Phantom membrane | 2 (1⁄31)  | 3.22%  | 31           |

After a cat gives a gift, both the cat and the gift are located in the general area of the bed the player slept on, including on the other side of walls or floors.

If a player has multiple standing tamed cats in the area, only the tamed cat that sleeps on the player may provide a gift. If all standing tamed cats in the area are prevented from reaching the player (i.e. trapped in minecarts or boats), then in Java Edition each cat has a 70% chance of providing a gift while in Bedrock Edition only one cat may give a gift.

### Teleportation
Tamed cats teleport to the owner if they are more than 12 blocks from the player, except where listed below. It is possible for a tamed cat to teleport to an inaccessible location (e.g. under ice) and be injured or suffocate of various causes as a result.

A cat does not teleport:

- If the cat has been ordered to sit.
	- Exception: The cat is likely to teleport if it is injured while sitting (it does not sit after it teleports). A dramatic example is if a cat sitting outside is struck bylightning, in which case the cat materializes onfire. This kills the cat.
	- Exception: If a kitten is told to sit, and grows up while thechunkit is sitting in is still loaded, it teleports to the player and materializes still sitting.
- If the cat is attempting to sit on a chest, bed, or furnace.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
- If the cat is attempting to lay or is laying on a bed.
- If the cat is in aminecartorboat.
- If the cat has been attached to afencepost with alead.
- If the cat is in an unloadedchunk.
- If none of theblockson the edge of a 5×5×1 region centered on the player aretransparentblocks with an opaque block below and another transparent block above.
- If the player is in another dimension.
- If the player is in water: The cat teleports to the player when the player leaves the water.
- If the cat is in water: teleportation is unreliable. It may or may not occur.

Cat teleportation is completely silent.[4]
