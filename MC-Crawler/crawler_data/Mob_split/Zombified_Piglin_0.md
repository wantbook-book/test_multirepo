# Zombified Piglin
Zombified piglins, known as zombie pigmen before the Nether Update, are neutral undead variants of piglins that inhabit the Nether. Zombified piglins normally ignore players, but if one is attacked, it and all zombified piglins in the vicinity become enraged and attack the aggressor with their golden swords.

## Spawning
Zombified piglins can spawn in nether wastes, crimson forests, nether portals, from pigs struck by lightning, or from piglins or piglin brutes in the Overworld or in the End. They have a 5% chance of spawning as baby zombified piglins. Zombified piglins do not spawn on top of nether wart blocks. Like other naturally fireproof mobs, they can spawn on magma blocks.

A baby zombified piglin has a 0.26% chance of spawning as a chicken jockey in Java Edition. An adult zombified piglin also has a 3.3% chance of spawning riding a Strider above lava, holding a warped fungus on a stick.

All zombified piglins spawn with a golden sword, which has up to 25% chance of being enchanted in Normal or Hard modes. This chance varies depending on the regional difficulty. The sword's enchantment is from 5 to 23 levels.

On Halloween (October 31), zombified piglins have a 22.5% chance of spawning with a carved pumpkin or a 2.5% chance of spawning with a jack o'lantern equipped as headgear.‌[Java Edition  only] This is not dropped, even if killed with Looting.

### Nether
Zombified piglins spawn in groups of 4‌[JE  only] / 2-4‌[BE  only] in the Nether at light level 11 and below on most blocks other than nether wart block. They spawn most commonly in nether wastes, frequently in nether fortresses, uncommonly in crimson forests and are sometimes found riding striders in lava oceans.

### Nether portals
When a nether portal block in the Overworld receives a random tick, there is a chance of 1⁄2000 (0.05%) on Easy, 1⁄1000 (0.1%) on Normal and 3⁄2000 (0.15%) on Hard for it to spawn a zombified piglin. 

In Java Edition, they appear inside one of the portal blocks on the bottom.

In Bedrock Edition, they spawn one block to the east or south of the portal (depending on which direction the portal is facing). Neither slabs nor lighting prevents this. "Portal ticking" can be used to increase the rate of zombified piglin spawning by repeatedly lighting and breaking a nether portal.

Zombified piglin spawning via this process is completely independent of the mob cap, similar to the spawning of phantoms in Java Edition, which means they can still spawn if there are a sufficient number of hostile mobs in the world. 

Zombified piglins who spawn in this way cannot travel to the Nether for a preset amount of time, whether they walk through the portal they spawned in or through nearby portals.‌[Java Edition  only]

### Pigs
A zombified piglin spawns when lightning strikes within 4 blocks of a pig. If the pig is a piglet, it then transforms into a baby zombified piglin.

### Piglins
A piglin or piglin brute that enters the Overworld or the End transforms into a zombified piglin after 15 seconds. When piglins wielding crossbows zombify, they keep their crossbows, but are unable to use them, and perform melee attack like other zombified piglins. When baby piglins zombify, they do not have weapons, unlike baby zombified piglins that naturally spawn. When piglin brutes zombify, they keep their axes.

The newly zombified piglin gets the Nausea effect for 10 seconds. This is a purely visual effect, and does not affect the mob's behavior.

A zombified piglin keeps any armor or weapons collected before being zombified‌[JE  only].

Baby zombified piglins also have a 5% chance of becoming a chicken jockey‌[Java Edition  only].

If a piglin is in the middle of bartering and gets zombified while inspecting a gold ingot, it drops the ingot when it turns into a zombified piglin.
