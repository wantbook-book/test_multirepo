# Breeze
A breeze is a hostile mob spawned by certain trial spawners found in trial chambers, and the only source of breeze rods. When attacking something, a breeze moves via jumping large distances and attacks by firing wind charges, which deal high knockback. It can repel all projectiles, taking no damage from them.

## Spawning
Breezes spawn from trial spawners surrounded by chiseled tuff in the trial chambers.

Breezes can only spawn in a place the spawner can see.

## Drops

10 experience orbs are dropped if killed by a player or tamed wolf.

## Behavior
A breeze leaps around to attack players with its wind charge attack. Before jumping, it compresses itself like a spring and can jump up to 15 blocks horizontally and 5 blocks vertically. If the breeze is in lava, it can only jump one block into the air. 

Breezes repel all projectiles except wind charges.  Unlike shields, breezes reflect projectiles while maintaining the same velocity, so potentially harming other entities. Breezes are also immune to fall damage.

If a player is within 1–2 blocks of a breeze, it no longer chooses to attack.

Breezes are partially immune to the Invisibility effect. The eyebrows and surrounding wind remain visible.

Breezes actively pursue and attack iron golems.

Breezes can rotate themselves while in a boat. They are the only mobs that can do this.

### Wind charge
Main article: Wind Charge
Breeze shoots a wind charge at a player or enemy within a distance of 16 blocks. When a breeze's wind charge attack directly hits an entity, the entity takes damage, and a burst of wind appears. If a wind charge hits a block, only a burst of wind appears. This burst of wind deals knockback but does not deal any damage by itself; instead, it often deals damage by making the entity fall a high distance. The wind burst can also interact with buttons, levers, non-iron doors and trapdoors, and fence gates to toggle their block state, extinguish lit candles, and swing bells. Such interactions can be a threat in trial chambers and are not affected by the mobGriefing game rule.

Wind charges can be deflected if hit with another projectile or a melee attack, similar to ghast fireballs.
