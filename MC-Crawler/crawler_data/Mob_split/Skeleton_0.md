## Spawning
### Light level
A skeleton may spawn above a solid block at a light level of 0 from all Overworld except in mushroom fields and deep dark biomes. They spawn in small groups of up to four skeletons in Java Edition or two[more information needed] skeletons in Bedrock Edition.

### Spider jockeys
Spiders have a 1% chance to spawn with a skeleton riding them, creating a spider jockey.

### Skeleton traps during thunderstorms
Four skeleton horsemen spawn when a skeleton horse trap is triggered, typically during a thunderstorm. The skeletons ride on skeleton horses and are equipped with enchanted bows and iron helmets. In Java Edition, they have damage immunity for 3 seconds after spawning.

### In the Nether
Skeletons spawn commonly in soul sand valleys biomes. However, skeletons have a lower population density in soul sand valleys than zombified piglins have in nether wastes (i.e. there are much fewer skeletons in a given area).

In nether fortresses structures, there is a 20% chance that a skeleton spawns in place of a wither skeleton.

### Monster spawners
Skeletons spawn from 25% of the monster spawners found in monster rooms.

### Trial spawners
‌In Java Edition 1.21 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.0‌[upcoming], regular skeletons have a chance to be selected as the "ranged" mob for trial spawners in trial chambers.

### Variants
Many skeletons are also replaced by their variants, strays, in snowy biomes, and bogged[only upcoming Java Edition 1.21 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.0], in swamp biomes.

## Drops

↑ Only dropped when killed by a charged creeper.


A skeleton always drops any equipment is picked up. A Skeleton also has a random chance to drop each piece of naturally spawned equipment, including its bow, but only if it is killed by a player or tamed wolf. The chance to drop a naturally spawned piece of equipment is 8.5% without Looting, 9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II, and 11.5% with Looting III.

A skeleton also drops experience when killed by a player or a tamed wolf. The amount of experience dropped can be as little as 5 or as much as 20. Skeletons drop 5 experience as a base. For each piece of naturally spawned equipment the skeleton has, it drops a random 1–3 experience as well. The random amount dropped by each piece is independent of the amounts dropped by the other pieces.

## Behavior
Skeletons chase players, baby turtles, and iron golems they see within 16 blocks, climbing stairs or ladders, navigating mazes and traversing other complex obstacles to get within shooting range. 

An idle skeleton and a skeleton shooting.
When within 15 blocks of a target, with a clear line of sight, a skeleton starts shooting with arrows, once every 2 seconds on Easy and Normal difficulties or once every second on Hard difficulty. If the player leaves the 15-block radius, skeletons wait for some seconds with the bow charged, shooting the moment the player comes within range again. Their detection range is reduced by 50% if a skeleton skull is worn by the player. This stacks with sneaking and the Invisibility effect. 

The skeleton's accuracy is based on the world difficulty. Skeletons have an "error" of 10 on Easy, 6 on Normal and 2 on Hard. This is compared to the player's lack of accuracy of 1. To account for gravity, skeletons aim 0.2 blocks higher for every horizontal block of range to the target.

Skeletons have infinite durability on their bows, and can shoot an infinite amount of arrows. Arrows shot by skeletons cannot be picked up from the ground.

Skeleton behavior varies between the game editions:

Java Edition
- Strafe in circular patterns to dodge attacks and retreat to a safe range if the player comes within 4 blocks. They can walk off cliffs while strafing.[1]
- Sprinttoward the player if they are 14 blocks away or farther.
- Use bows even underwater. Thewaterslows down the arrows.
- Animates its bow while attacking.

Bedrock Edition
- Skeletons typically stop moving to shoot, making no attempt to avoid being hit.
- An underwater skeleton uses a melee attack because it is unable to use abowunderwater.
- A skeleton on land shoots quickly at a player in water. The rate of fire increases as the player approaches, makingcombatdifficult due to the knockback.
- Skeletons typically shoot more rapidly at players the more they are closer to it.

In most cases, if a skeleton's arrow hits a neutral or hostile mob that has not yet been attacked by the player, the mob attacks the skeleton. When a skeleton is attacked by another mob (including another skeleton), it attacks that mob, reorienting on the player once the mob is dead. Skeletons flee from wolves. A skeleton runs from a chasing wolf until the wolf deals damage, after which the skeleton turns to shoot at the wolf that successfully attacked it.

Dueling skeletons. One skeleton turned red from being shot by the other skeleton. Additionally, a zombie can be seen to the left of the red skeleton.
Skeletons sink in water and cannot swim, but do not drown. If a skeleton is inside of powder snow for 7 seconds, it converts into a stray. A newly-converted stray always has full health even if converted from a damaged skeleton. The converted stray keeps any items worn or held when it was a skeleton. Only skeletons can become strays; bogged or wither skeletons cannot be converted.  

Wolves attacking a skeleton.
If spawned with a weapon other than a bow or no weapon at all (which can be spawned with commands such as /summon skeleton ~ ~ ~ {HandItems:[{Count:1,id:"iron_sword"}]}, or /summon skeleton ~ ~ ~ {}), or it picks up a weapon other than a bow, a skeleton charges at a player with arms outstretched and deals damage by touch, similar to a wither skeleton.

A skeleton holding a tipped arrow in its off-hand always shoots that type of arrow, and the arrow held is not consumed.

If a skeleton kills a creeper, the creeper drops a music disc. It can be any music disc, except for Pigstep, otherside, Relic, and 5.
