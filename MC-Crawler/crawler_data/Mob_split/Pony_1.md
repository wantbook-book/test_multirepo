### General
Mobs
- "Super Hostile Mode" is an occasional event (every 2–5 minutes on Purple version).
	- Consisting of a shower oflightningbolts around the player (and usually striking the player at least once), while spawning a large number of powerful monsters in the area and applying the Blindness status to the player. These spawns include not only heavily armed and armoredzombiesandskeletons, and multiplecharged creepers, but even the occasionalblazeand other monsters that don't usually spawn in the Overworld. This is a reference toVechs'Super Hostile series of maps. All of these are apparently triggered by "punching wood" or crafting anything. Naturally, these are some of the first things a Survival player needs to do.

Options
There is a new option for Super HD Graphics. When this option is turned on, it makes all textures monochrome except for recolored/secondary layer textures, such as grass side overlay or the colored glass. Super HD Graphics mode does not, however, make the game more laggy or glitchy.

Speech bubbles
Blocks and mobs can have speech bubbles containing text above their heads, simulating talking. All quotes:

- That hurts :(
- My eye!
- ..zzZZZ
