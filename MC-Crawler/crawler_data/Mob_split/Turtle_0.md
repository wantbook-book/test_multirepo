# Turtle
A turtle (in Java Edition), also known as a sea turtle (in Bedrock Edition), is a common passive mob found in beach biomes. They are the only source of turtle scutes, which drop from baby turtles when they mature into adults.

## Spawning
Turtles occasionally spawn in small groups, on the sand in beaches in the Overworld, but not in snowy beaches or stony shores.

Turtles have a 10% chance to spawn as babies.

In Java Edition, turtles spawn in groups of up to 5 individuals, at light levels greater than 8, on sand blocks less than 4 blocks above sea level.

In Bedrock Edition, turtles spawn in groups of 2–6, in light levels of 7 and higher, at Y=60–67.

## Drops
### Breeding
Upon successful breeding, 1–7 is dropped.

Baby turtles do not drop anything when they die.

### Growth
When a baby turtle grows up to an adult it drops:

## Behavior
Turtles can both move around on land and swim in water. They move slowly on land, but they can swim at a fast speed in the water. Like other passive mobs, they move around aimlessly and flee when attacked. When on land, they generally attempt to move to the nearest water source. When in an enclosed area, such as a player-made enclosure, they generally swim in circles if the water is in the area, and rarely go on land to explore, if there is any.

Turtles cannot be attached to leads,[1] but they can be led by a player holding seagrass within 10 blocks of the turtle.

Turtles can be picked up by boats and minecarts.

Turtles are killed instantly when struck by lightning.

As with other aquatic mobs, turtles suffer extra damage when hit by a trident with the Impaling enchantment in Java Edition, and cannot drown, despite the fact that real-life turtles breathe air.

### Predators
Turtles and turtle eggs are attacked by the following mobs:

Zombies and their variants deliberately trample on turtle eggs, causing them to break.


↑ a b Unlike zombies, zombified piglins, and their variants, withers and ravagers do not intentionally break turtle eggs but are able to break turtle eggs if they are in its way.


### Home position
A turtle remembers the block on which it spawned as its home position. No matter how far away the turtle is, it always attempts to return to its home position to lay its eggs after breeding.

If the player uses a tool enchanted with Silk Touch to obtain and move turtle eggs to a new location before hatching, the baby turtles remember the new hatching location as their home beach.

If a turtle is spawned from a spawn egg, summoned with the /summon command, or spawned by a monster spawner, it remembers the spawn location as its home position.

A turtle digs sand around the block on which it lays its eggs.
