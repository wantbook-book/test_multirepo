## Spawning
Naturally spawned horse herd. Notice the same color but different markings.
Horses spawn in plains and savannas in herds of 2–6. For horses, all combinations of color and markings are equally likely. All members of the herd have the same color, but markings may vary. 20% of all individual horses spawn as foals. In Java Edition, all of individual horses spawn as adults when using spawn eggs.[1]

Villages naturally generate with stables and animal pens containing horses.

## Appearance
All 35 colorations of horses. Base colors, from left to right: white, buckskin, flaxen chestnut, bay, black, dapple gray, and dark bay. Markings, from top to bottom: none, stockings and blaze, paint, snowflake appaloosa, and sooty.
Each horse variant has unique features and markings, and a foal (baby) version. Adult horses are 1.4 blocks wide and long, and 1.6 blocks high. Foals start at half the size of adults, and in Bedrock Edition, get progressively bigger as they age. Unlike wolves and cats, the appearances of horses do not change once they have been tamed, though tame horses may be differentiated by giving them equipment.

Horses have a stocky build. They can have 1 of 7 base colors: white, buckskin, flaxen chestnut, bay, black, dapple gray, and dark bay; and 1 of 5 marking patterns: no markings, stockings and blaze, paint, snowflake appaloosa and sooty. In total, there are 35 possible horse coat combinations.

Unlike almost all other mobs, horses with equipped saddles don't render these when under the effect of Invisibility.[2]

## Usage
See also: Transportation

Tamed and saddled horses can be used as a means of transportation in the game. When ridden, they are able to move faster and jump higher than a normal player. Horses can be used to climb hills and jump fences, as some can jump high enough to clear up to five block heights, versus the player's maximum of about one (without jump boost).

Horses cannot float on water when being controlled by a player. They can be ridden in water up to 2 blocks deep. In deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.[3]

Horses can be pulled along and tied up using a lead. They can be towed in two ways: Horses can swim behind a boat by using a lead, or a boat can be attached to a lead‌[Bedrock Edition  only] (before putting the horse in the boat) and the player can swim to tow the boat containing the horse. 

### Equipment
Horse UI
Tamed horses have the following two slots available:

- Horse armor slot: for equippinghorse armor. Exclusive to horses.
- Saddle slot: for equipping asaddle.

Foals cannot be equipped, as they cannot be ridden.

Equipment can be placed on a horse by holding it and then using on the horse, or by accessing its inventory. A horse’s inventory can be accessed by mounting the horse and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using or pressing the "open inventory" button‌[Bedrock Edition  only] on the horse. A normal horse’s inventory has two slots, one for a saddle and one for horse armor. The player cannot open their inventory while on a wild, or untamed, horse, though they can open containers.
