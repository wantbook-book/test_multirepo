# Enderman
An enderman is a tall neutral mob found in all three dimensions. Endermen normally ignore players but run to attack those that damage it or look directly at its face. Endermen teleport to avoid water (which harms them), sunlight, projectiles and some other damage sources, and they occasionally pick up certain blocks.

## Spawning
An enderman in the Overworld.
Endermen can spawn on any solid surface that has at least three empty spaces above, at the light level of 0 in the Overworld and the End, or a light level of 7  or less in the Nether. They are the only mobs that spawn naturally in all 3 dimensions.

### Overworld
Endermen spawn uncommonly in the Overworld, in all biomes except mushroom fields and deep dark. They often spawn in groups of two, and rarely in groups of three.

### Nether
Endermen spawn rarely in soul sand valleys, uncommonly in nether wastes and most commonly in warped forests.

### End
Endermen spawn commonly in groups of up to four, anywhere in the End dimension.

## Behavior
An enderman can be provoked by a player or other mob attacking them. They can also be provoked by a player looking them in the eyes for 5 game ticks (1⁄4 second)[1] from up to 64 blocks away. Endermen open their mouths and begin to shake‌[Java Edition  only] angrily if provoked; they also make loud and lengthy sounds while being stared at. If the player continues to maintain eye contact, the enderman does not move, although it may teleport away. Once the player stops looking at the enderman, it runs toward the back of the player to attack, although it ceases if hit by another player or mob.[2] An aggravated enderman runs fast and often teleports to the location of a player or mob up to 32 blocks away (orthogonally). Endermen are not provoked by a player viewing it through a transparent block or while wearing a carved pumpkin.

An aggravated enderman pursues the player until it is either killed or distracted by external elements, such as rain or fire. They do not take damage from sunlight like undead mobs, but when at a sufficient light level under the sky during the day they teleport randomly, typically winding up in caves (although certain non-full blocks, such as soul sand and mud, also register as "dark" when the enderman is standing in them).

Endermen can be harmed by melee attacks, water, lava, fire, splash water bottles, or rain. They are not damaged when standing in a filled cauldron‌[Java Edition  only].[3] Endermen teleport away when they take damage from any of natural sources (1), continuing to do so until they find a safe location. They also teleport while taking damage from other sources, such as suffocation, Poison, or Wither. 

Ranged attacks are ineffective against endermen, as they teleport when hit by a projectile instead of taking damage. Endermen that are hit by projectiles do not become hostile.[4] Arrows‌[Java Edition  only] and tridents appear to bounce off an enderman who is unable to teleport. In Bedrock Edition, arrows go straight through endermen that are unable to teleport (but the effect still goes through if it's a tipped arrow).[needs in-game testing]. 

Endermen can step up one full block without having to jump.

Endermen are hostile to endermites within 64 blocks but are passive to other mobs unless provoked.

An enderman in a player's vicinity prevents the player from sleeping in a bed at night as if any hostile mob were nearby. If the player is already asleep in a bed, it is possible for an enderman to teleport on it and wake players by pushing them off.

The endermen's aggression range for being looked at is reduced when the player is sneaking, or under the Invisibility effect depending on the number of armor pieces currently worn. The detection range in blocks for invisible players is shown in the following table:

| Number of armor pieces | Sneaking | Normal |
|------------------------|----------|--------|
| 0                      | 3        | 4      |
| 1                      | 8        | 11     |
| 2                      | 17       | 22     |
| 3                      | 26       | 33     |
| 4                      | 35       | 44     |
