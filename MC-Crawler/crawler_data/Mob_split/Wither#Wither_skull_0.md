# Wither
The wither is a player-constructed and highly destructive undead hostile boss mob that can hover in mid-air and fire barrages of explosive wither skulls at almost any living thing. It is the only source of nether stars, which are used to craft beacons.

## Spawning



















Wither build configuration. Soul soil can be used interchangeably with soul sand.

The wither is spawned by placing 4 blocks of soul sand and/or soul soil in a T shape (see image on the right in the "Behavior" section), and putting 3 wither skeleton skulls on top of the three upper blocks. The last block placed must be one of the three skulls and can be placed by the player or a dispenser. Air blocks are required on either side of the base soul sand or soul soil under the upper blocks (non-solid blocks such as grass and flowers prevent the wither from spawning). The building pattern can have any orientation (including horizontal and upside-down) as well as the skulls; the wither always spawns at the foot of the pattern. When the wither has successfully spawned, it is angered and creates an explosion around itself.

When the difficulty is set to Peaceful, the wither despawns (unlike the ender dragon) and building the wither structure does nothing. 

## Drops
### On death

On death, the wither always drops a Nether star. It drops 50 xp when killed by a player or tamed wolf.

## Behavior
The difference between the ender dragon's boss bar and that of the wither.
### Spawning
When spawned, the wither grows larger in size as its health bar fills up. While in this state, the wither is invulnerable, and neither moves nor attacks. When this state ends after 11 seconds or 220 game ticks, the wither creates a large explosion centered on itself, destroying nearby blocks and dealing tons of damage to nearby players and other entities. 

It is the largest individual explosion that the player can cause in Java Edition without commands, with a blast power of 7, more than that of a charged creeper or an end crystal. It is accompanied by a global sound event (a sound that is played for everyone, no matter how far away they are from the wither‌[JE  only] [1]). After this, the wither attacks nearby mobs and can take damage.

### Health and damage
The wither has a large health pool. In Java Edition, wither's health is 300 × 150, regardless of difficulty. In Bedrock Edition, wither's health depends on difficulty:

- 300× 150on Easy

- 450× 225on Normal

- 600× 300on Hard

The wither is immune to fire, lava, drowning and freezing. Like other undead mobs, the wither is harmed by the Instant Health effect and healed by the Instant Damage effect as well as affected by weapons with the Smite enchantment. It is immune to all other status effects.

Upon taking damage, the wither breaks all blocks within a 3×4×3 area around it, including blast-resistant blocks like obsidian, crying obsidian, and ancient debris, dropping them as items if possible. The wither is the only mob in the game that can destroy obsidian. (See Tutorials/Obsidian farming)

The wither cannot break the following blocks: 

- Barrier
- Bedrock
- Command Block
- End Gateway
- End Portal
- End Portal Frame
- Jigsaw Block
- Light Block
- Moving Block‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
- Moving Piston
- Reinforced Deepslate
- Structure Block


In Java Edition, these blocks are listed under the wither_immune tag.

The wither's block-breaking behavior makes suffocation ineffective under most circumstances. However, the blocks listed above, as well as some natural structures that include them (like exit portal), can be used to suffocate the wither due to their wither immunity.

The wither is hostile toward all mobs except:

- Agents‌[BE & edu  only]
- Ghasts[2]
- Undeadmobs:
	- Other withers
	- Phantoms
	- Skeletonsand their variants
	- Skeleton horsesandzombie horses
	- Zoglinsandzombified piglins
	- Zombiesand their variants

- Mobs with theInvulnerableNBT tag.

Armadillos are afraid of withers (and other undead mobs) and hide in their shell if a wither is nearby.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80]

If the wither is idle, it simply hovers and is unable to gain altitude. On Normal or Hard difficulty, it fires blue skulls in random directions until it finds a target.

The color of the wither's bossbar depends on the edition: dark purple in Java Edition or light purple in Bedrock Edition. It appears only when a player is looking in the wither's direction, including through walls. All withers display a boss bar on the screen. A renamed wither displays it's changed name above it's boss bar. The sky darkens when the wither spawns (a kind of fog).

### Java Edition
Wither with 'wither armor' effect, after half health depleted.
Upon noticing a mob or a player, the wither hovers above it and rapidly shoots black wither skulls. Each head fires independently, allowing a wither to attack up to three different mobs/players at the same time. The main head controls the wither's movement and has a 0.1% chance to shoot a blue wither skull instead of the default black one.

Whenever a wither kills another mob, a wither rose is planted if the ground is grass block, dirt, coarse dirt, moss block, mud, netherrack, soul sand, or soul soil on Java Edition, or otherwise dropped as an item at that mob's location; however, it may be destroyed by other wither skulls. Wither roses are planted/dropped even when the game rule doMobLoot is set to false.[3]

The wither has a passive regeneration rate of 1 every 20 ticks (1 second), and a direct killing blow on a target instantly heals 5.

When its health drops below half (150 × 75), the wither gains a natural "wither armor" effect, which makes it immune to damage from arrows and thrown tridents and causes it to fly at the same height as the target. The armor disappears if it regenerates above half health.
