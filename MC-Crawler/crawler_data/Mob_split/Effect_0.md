# Effect
An effect (also known as mob effect or status effect) is a helpful, harmful or a mostly useless condition that affects an entity. Effects can be inflicted in various ways throughout the game, including consuming potions and some food items, being in the range of beacons and conduits, and being attacked by or close to certain mobs.

## Behavior
Entities inflicted by an effect are affected in various ways for an amount of time. During the effect, spiral-shaped particles emanate from the position of the inflicted entity. For most effects, higher levels increase the strength of the effect.

In Java Edition, players can open their inventory to see any current effects afflicted upon them, as well as the levels and duration of each. In Bedrock Edition, effects are displayed in a separate screen, which can be opened by pressing Z on a keyboard, pressing // on a controller, or tapping the effect icon when using touch controls.

Any number of different effects, including opposing effects such as Strength and Weakness, can be simultaneously active on a player. However, it is not possible to apply the same effect multiple times, even if they are of different levels. When applying an effect already active on the player, higher levels overwrite lower levels, and higher durations overwrite lower durations of the same level. 

In Java Edition, when a stronger effect overrides the weaker effect, the weaker effect remains, but is hidden. It returns after the stronger effect expires, if the weaker effect has a higher duration than the stronger effect. In Bedrock Edition, when a stronger effect overrides the weaker effect, the weaker effect is deleted and does not return.[1]

When drinking from milk bucket, dying, being saved from death by a totem of undying, or traveling through the exit portal in the End,[2] all effects are removed.

Damage dealt by effects (a kind of "magical damage") completely bypasses armor, making it a good way to deal with highly-armored targets (Protection enchantments reduce damage taken from effects, however). Witches are the only mob to have natural protection against effects, taking 85% less‌[Java Edition  only] or 95% less‌[Bedrock Edition  only] damage from effects.

## Immunity
Effects can only be applied to living entities. Additionally, certain entities are immune to some or all effects:

- Silverfishare immune to Infested.‌[upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0]

## Effect list
In Java Edition, positive effects have blue text in potion information and are displayed on the upper row of effects in the HUD, while negative effects have red potion text and are displayed in the bottom row. Neutral effects have the blue potion text and are listed with the negative effects in the bottom row in the heads up display. If the effect is a beacon effect, then it also has a blue outline. In Bedrock Edition, negative effect names in potion and tipped arrow tooltips are shown in red; positive and neutral effect names in these contexts, and all effect names in the "Mob effects" screen, are shown in white.
