### Allay duplication
An allay duplicating.
If an allay is given an amethyst shard while it is dancing due to a nearby jukebox playing any music disc, it splits into two allays (itself and a new allay) and the amethyst shard is consumed. After duplication, both allays have a five minute cooldown before being able to duplicate again. Allays do not have a baby form.

### Teleportation

  

This feature is exclusive to  Bedrock Edition. 


When a player teleports through a nether portal, the player's allay teleports with them, even if it does not enter the portal.

When a player teleports through an end portal, the allay teleports to the End only if a player gives the allay an item before teleporting and must be nearby the player as they teleport.

Allays holding an item follow the player through a portal if they are 21 blocks horizontally to the player or if they are within 22 blocks vertically of the player's legs. Allays do not travel through portals regardless of how close they are if they are tethered to a fence with a lead.
