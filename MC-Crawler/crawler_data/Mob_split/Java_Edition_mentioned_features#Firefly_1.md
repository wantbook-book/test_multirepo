### Shaders
On the feedback site, shaders (resource packs that override the vanilla shaders) were marked as announced, meaning that they were going to be implemented. This feature was partially implemented in 1.16 and 1.17, as resource packs can enable similar effects.

### Farming nerf
Somewhere in 1.16, developers stated that certain changes would be made to functionality exploited in several farms. In particular:

- Fortress mobs can spawn anywhere inside of the boundary of a nether fortress rather than only at the roads.
- Angryzombified piglinsdrop experience even when not killed by the player directly.

The sculk mechanics introduced in 1.19 may be intended as a replacement.

### Explosion smoke
In Java Edition 1.15 Pre-release 1, black smoke particles which were emitted by explosions were removed due to poor implementation, which was a major source of explosion-related lag. Reintroduction of these particles is planned for an unspecified future version.[7]

## Delayed or scrapped
These features were initially promised to be implemented in a specific update, but were later postponed and have not currently been made part of another update.

### Fletching table functionality
Fletching tables are set to gain functionality in a later update, similar to what happened with smithing tables (originally added as a generic villager job site block and then received player functionality in a future update). Originally, this was planned for "the next major themed update".[8] Later, it was stated that functionality wasn't a guarantee for 1.16.[9] Later, it was confirmed that Fletching tables wouldn’t be gaining functionality in 1.16.[10] To this day, they still have no functionality beyond serving as the workplace block for fletcher villagers.

### Bundle
 Originally announced for the Caves & Cliffs update, development of this item was delayed for a future version.[11] Bundles are a storage item that can be used for managing items inside the player's inventory, and allow for combination of multiple item types within single inventory slots. As of Java Edition 1.20.4, they are still obtainable by enabling the “Bundle” experimental toggle when creating a new world.

### Updates to birch forests and other biomes

 In Minecraft Live 2021, it was stated that The Wild Update would focus on biome diversity and immersion, giving a unique identity and atmosphere to different biomes. The birch forest was used as an example to demonstrate this new atmosphere, and concept art pieces depicting an improved birch forest with new flowers, shelf fungi, tree branches and fallen logs were shown. Later it was stated that "concept art is not a commitment" and that this part of the update was now "not something we have continued working with" in an Ask Mojang episode.[12]

### Firefly
Main article: Firefly
 Fireflies were originally going to be eaten by frogs to produce froglights, but this was scrapped due to the fact that some species of fireflies are poisonous to some species of frogs in real life.[13] They would have glowed in the dark and been two pixels in size, which would have made them the smallest mob in the game. It was officially confirmed that they were scrapped for the 1.19 update in an Ask Mojang episode.[12]

## Partially implemented
These features had been shown by a Mojang staff member, but had no further development or were canceled shortly after.

| Sky                           | A hidden biome beforeJava Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4, this biome was exclusive to, and the sole biome of, theSky dimension. It would generate floating islands with oceans of air surrounding them. Trees were uncommon. No weather occurred here. It had small patches of snow, although it would not reaccumulate if destroyed. Its foliage color was green with some extra blue hue. This biome was introduced inJava Edition Beta 1.6along with the Sky dimension itself. While the Sky dimension was removed, its biome and associated terrain generation were repurposed for use inthe End. |       |
| Ice Desert(corner case biome) | A biome in the code beforeJava Edition Beta 1.8that was supposed to generate at maximum coldness and dryness, but did not actually generate due to bugs. It was a biome of sand with snow on top of it and hadsnowfallandice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |       |

### Dirt slab
The dirt slabs, replacing all the dirt (not grass) blocks.
 Before stone slabs were added to 0.26, Notch ran a test of dirt slabs.[14]

In the original Caves & Cliffs announcement, an item called the brush was showcased, which appeared to be able to lower the height of certain blocks. However, it has been confirmed that this was only a special breaking animation, and couldn't be used to physically make slabs.[citation needed] The showcased animation has since been changed, and it now only applies to suspicious sand and suspicious gravel.

### Sky dimension
Main article: Sky dimension
A plain sky dimension.
The Sky dimension was a planned dimension, intended to be the opposite of the Nether. It could be accessed using third-party programs, but portals to the Sky dimension were never implemented. The idea was ultimately scrapped[15][16][17][18][19][20] and its code was reused to make the End, which can be seen in versions prior to 14w17a as the End's technical biome was still referred to in the debug menu as "Sky".

Unlike the Sky dimension, the End has a dark purple sky, no clouds, and the floating islands are made entirely of end stone.

With the addition of the buffet functionality in Java Edition 1.13 snapshot 18w15a, this can be distantly recreated by using the "Floating Islands" option. The addition of custom world generation in Java Edition 1.16.2 snapshot 20w28a also included a minecraft:floating_islands noise preset offering similar functionality.
