### Sunlight
A skeleton burning in sunlight.
When the moon can no longer be seen (Dawn) and the sun is above 15°, skeletons can burn. Burning is suppressed when the skeleton is

- in a place with a non-air block directly over it. InJava Edition, the roof must be a light-blocking block.
- in a sufficiently shaded area: asunlight levelof 11 or less.
- in water. A skeleton pathfinds to water if it is not wearing head armor and not already in water.
- wearing headarmor.Helmetsslowly get damaged when a skeleton has it on in sunlight, and it eventually breaks.
- under the status effect ofFire Resistance.
- standing in cobwebs.[2]

Transparent and translucent blocks, including glass and ice, do not prevent them from burning.‌[JE  only].

Unlike zombies, which leave the shade to chase a player, skeletons do not exit the shaded area while attacking.

### Mob type
Being an undead mob, they are: 

- damaged by the status effectInstant Healthand healed by the status effectInstant Damage.
- unaffected by the status effectsRegenerationandPoison.
- ignored by thewither.
- affected by theSmiteenchantment.
- a threat toarmadillos, causing them to hide in their shell.‌[upcoming: JE 1.20.5 & BE 1.20.80]

### Geared skeletons
Some spawned skeletons have the ability to pick up dropped items from the ground. Unlike zombies, however, they pick up only weapons or armor. If a picked up item is armor, a carved pumpkin or a mob head, a skeleton equips itself with the item. If the picked up item is a weapon, the skeleton uses the item as a melee weapon. In Bedrock Edition, skeletons can also pick up and equip illager banners worn in their chest slot.

Skeletons spawn already-armed with bows, which may be enchanted. The chances of that event are listed below. If a skeleton spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (all pieces are made of the same material) except if it is spawned as part of a skeleton trap, in which case only the iron helmet may not match the rest of the armor.

|                            | Easy | Normal         | Hard               |
|----------------------------|------|----------------|--------------------|
| Armor                      | 0%   | 0%–15%[note 1] | 1.875%–15%[note 1] |

If a skeleton does spawn with armor, the chances of specific armor are as follows:

| Armor    | Easy & Normal | Hard  |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| 1 piece  | 100%          | 100%  |
| 2 pieces | 75%           | 90%   |
| 3 pieces | 56.25%        | 81%   |
| Full set | 42.19%        | 72.9% |

In Java Edition, the armor pieces go from feet to head, and in Bedrock Edition, they go from head to feet.

The chances of it being of a particular material are:

| Armor type | Chance |
|------------|--------|
| Leather    | 37.06% |
| Gold       | 48.73% |
| Chain      | 12.90% |
| Iron       | 1.2%   |
| Diamond    | 0.04%  |

The armor is not damaged from most damage sources; it cannot "wear out" the way player armor does. Helmets (not blocks like carved pumpkins) on skeletons can break if the skeleton is exposed to daylight or has an anvil or other falling block dropped on its hitbox.

If a skeleton has a bow and a sword is given, it drops the bow, with the same chance as if killed with Looting I and starts using the sword. If a skeleton has a sword or bow in its hand, and one of a better type or with better enchantments is given, the skeleton drops the existing weapon, with the same chance as if killed with Looting I in favor of the better one. Any skeleton that spawns with equipment (picked-up items do not count) gives 1–3 extra experience points per item.

If multiple viable items exist, the skeleton endlessly picks up and drops the items.[3]

On Halloween, skeletons may spawn wearing a carved pumpkin or jack o'lantern. They do not drop this, even when killed with Looting.
