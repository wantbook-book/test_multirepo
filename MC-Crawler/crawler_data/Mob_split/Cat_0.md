## Spawning
Cats can spawn every 1200 ticks (1 minute). A random player is selected (including spectators) and a random location is chosen 8-32 blocks away from the player horizontally in both directions and at the same height. A cat can spawn if that block is less than 2 chunks from a village with fewer than 5 cats, or inside a swamp hut.

### Villages
Untamed cats spawn in villages as long as there are at least five claimed beds within 48 blocks and at most four cats within a 97×17×97 box centered around the spawn position. Cats that spawn with the creation of a village do not despawn, however, any additional cats that spawn within a village may despawn. A village cat spawns with a random appearance, although black cats may spawn only during a full moon; which works in both Java Edition and Bedrock Edition.[verify] The spawning of cats in villages is a separate process from the natural spawning of passive mobs and thus is not affected by the Creature mob cap.

In Bedrock Edition, a village periodically spawns stray cats to fill a quota of 1 cat per 4 owned beds, up to a maximum of 5 cats for 20 or more owned beds. Only owned beds (those currently claimed by a villager) are counted for this purpose. All cats within the village boundaries are counted, including kittens, cats that wander in from outside and even tamed cats owned by a player. If the number of cats found is short of the quota, the village tries to spawn one cat or kitten within a volume of 16×6×16 blocks centered on the village center. (This is the same volume used when a village spawns an iron golem.)

### Swamp hut
One untamed black cat generates alongside a witch inside swamp huts upon world generation. This cat never despawns. Additional cats can spawn within the hut similarly to witches; for this to happen, there must be grass blocks present inside the bounding box of the swamp hut. In Java Edition, any other cats to spawn within the swamp hut (from spawn eggs and commands without cat type set) always spawn as black. A new cat does not spawn in a hut if there is already a cat within a 16×8×16 block volume.‌[Java Edition  only][verify]

### Bedrock Edition
25% of cats spawn as kittens. During a full moon, 50% of cats that spawn are black.

- 1–3 when killed by aplayeror tamedwolf.

Upon successful breeding, 1–7 is dropped.

### Baby
Like other baby animals, killing a kitten yields no item or experience.

## Appearance
11 cat variants (from top to bottom and left to right): Tabby, Red, Calico, British shorthair, Black, Jellie, Persian, Siamese, White, Ragdoll, Tuxedo)
There are currently eleven variants of cats in Minecraft:

- Black (black with orange eyes)
- British Shorthair (silver with yellow eyes)
- Calico (orange, white and dark brown with yellow and blue eyes)
- Jellie (gray and white with gray-green eyes)
- Persian (creamy with blue eyes and flat faces)
- Ragdoll (white and soft amber with blue eyes)
- Red (orange and white with green eyes)
- Siamese (white and pale brown with blue eyes)
- Tabby (brown and white with yellow eyes)
- Tuxedo (black and white with green eyes)
- White (white with light blue and yellow eyes)

Cats wearing a collar are considered tamed. When a cat is initially tamed, the collar appears red by default. However, using one of the sixteen colored dyes on a tamed cat changes its collar to the corresponding color.

Despite sharing the same model, cats are smaller than ocelots.

The cat variant Jellie was chosen by the community from three finalists[1] of an online contest in 2018[2]. Jellie was was submitted to the Cat Contest by her owner GoodTimesWithScar.

In the default resource pack a texture file for a tamed gray tabby exists[3]‌[BE  only]; however it is completely unused and cannot be spawned in-game.
