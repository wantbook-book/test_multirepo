### Baby hoglins
Baby hoglins also attack the player, dealing much less damage and normal knockback. If the player attacks a baby hoglin, it temporarily flees.

Baby piglins run near and ride baby hoglins. If there are more baby piglins than baby hoglins, the baby piglins occasionally jump on other baby piglins already riding a baby hoglin, with a maximum of 3 stacked on a single baby hoglin.

### Zombification
A hoglin turning into a zoglin. Notice the hair is flattened down.
If a hoglin spawns in or moves to the Overworld or the End, it shakes and then transforms into a zoglin after 15 seconds. The newly-created zoglin gets Nausea I for 10 seconds. This Nausea effect is only decorative and has no effect on the zoglin's behavior. In Java Edition, any lead attached to the hoglin breaks when it converts, even though zoglins are leashable.[3]

### Breeding
Main article: Breeding
Hoglins can be bred with crimson fungi. It takes 5 minutes before the parents can be bred again, and it takes 20 minutes for baby hoglins to mature. Baby hoglins stay near their parents unless they see a player or get attacked, in which case they attack or run away. Feeding a crimson fungus to a baby hoglin reduces the remaining time for it to mature by 10%.

Hoglins cannot be bred when they are running away from warped fungi, respawn anchors or nether portals.

Feeding crimson fungi to a hoglin prevents it from despawning, no matter the breeding is successful or not. The baby hoglin produced by breeding does not despawn either.

Like the killer bunny‌[Java Edition  only], the hoglin is a hostile mob that can be bred.
