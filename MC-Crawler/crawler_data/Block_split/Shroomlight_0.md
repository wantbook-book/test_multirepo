### Natural generation
Both crimson and warped huge fungi can generate shroomlights near the top. This includes both naturally generated huge fungi and huge fungi grown with bone meal.


## Usage
### Light source
Shroomlights provide a light level of 15, the highest level in the game. Unlike Glowstone, Shroomlights also allows redstone signals to pass through them, as they are treated like a solid block. 

### Composting
Placing a shroomlight into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level.
