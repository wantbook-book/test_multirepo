# Beacon
A beacon is a block that projects a beam skyward, and can provide beneficial status effects to players in a radius around it when placed on top of a solid pyramid base constructed from iron, gold, diamond, emerald or netherite blocks.

## Obtaining
### Breaking
A beacon can be mined successfully by hand or with any tool. When destroyed by an explosion, the block always drops as an item.

| Block    | Beacon              |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 3                   |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 4.5                 |

### Crafting
| Name   | Ingredients                | Crafting recipe |

| Beacon | Glass+Nether Star+Obsidian |                 |

## Usage
When "activated", beacon blocks provide two unique functions: 

- A landmark beam reaching into the sky, which can be visible from far away.
- Powers, which give players status effects within a certain range.

Additionally, in Bedrock Edition beacons can also be waterlogged and conduct redstone power at the same time.

### Activation
The beacon base can be made of the different mineral blocks combined.
In order to activate a beacon, the beacon must meet the following requirements:

- Beacons require an unobstructed view of the sky.Transparentblocks (glass, water, etc.) and bedrock (the nether ceiling)  are allowed.
- The beacon is on top of a pyramid constructed fromiron blocks,gold blocks,emerald blocks,diamond blocks, and/ornetherite blocks.

#### Pyramids
The four possible pyramid arrangements when using the beacon block. From left to right the pyramid structures decrease in complexity and strength.
Pyramids are the structures required to activate beacons. There are four possible pyramid heights. More pyramid levels make more powers available in a wider affected vicinity. The type of mineral block used to build the pyramid is entirely cosmetic and has no functional effect. Several different block types can be mixed without affecting functionality. If the pyramid is damaged so that the beacon deactivates, the previously-set powers resume their effects upon reactivation when the pyramid is repaired. This applies to piston-altered pyramids as well. 

| Level | Mineral blocks             | Materials                  | Layers                     |
|-------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1     | 9                          | 81 (1 stack + 17 items)    | 3×3, beacon                |
| 2     | 34                         | 306 (4 stacks + 50 items)  | 5×5, 3×3, beacon           |
| 3     | 83 (1 stack + 19 blocks)   | 747 (11 stacks + 43 items) | 7×7, 5×5, 3×3, beacon      |
| 4     | 164 (2 stacks + 36 blocks) | 1476 (23 stacks + 4 items) | 9×9, 7×7, 5×5, 3×3, beacon |

This six-beacon pyramid provides all six effects from a single structure using the fewest mineral blocks possible.
Multiple beacons can make use of the same specific mineral blocks below them. Combined pyramids do not need to be symmetrical. The image to the right shows a 6-beacon (2 by 3) pyramid. It requires a total of 244 mineral blocks, with a base layer of 10 by 11.

| Level | Mineral blocks             | Materials                   | Layers                        |
|-------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1     | 20                         | 180 (2 stacks + 52 items)   | 4×5, beacons                  |
| 2     | 62                         | 558 (8 stacks + 46 items)   | 6×7, 4×5, beacons             |
| 3     | 134 (2 stacks + 6 blocks)  | 1206 (18 stacks + 54 items) | 8×9, 6×7, 4×5, beacons        |
| 4     | 244 (3 stacks + 52 blocks) | 2196 (34 stacks + 20 items) | 10×11, 8×9, 6×7, 4×5, beacons |

### Beam
A vertical beam appears from a beacon if the beacon is activated, extending from the beacon block up to beyond the top of the world.

- InJava Edition, the beam is visible up to 256 blocks away.
- InBedrock Edition, the beam is visible up to 64 blocks away, regardless of how high the render distance is set.[1]

#### Colors
The color of the beam may be changed by placing blocks of stained glass or stained glass panes anywhere above the beacon block. The beam changes colors according to the colors of glass placed above it: the first block sets the beam color, while each additional block sets the color by averaging the red, green, and blue components of the current beam color and the block's color. The color values are the same as those for the corresponding dye. This also works using hardened stained glass and hardened stained glass panes.‌[Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education  only] Stained glass panes have the same effect on the beam as stained glass blocks.

The resulting beam color can be found as C→=12n+1(c0→+∑i=1n2i−1ci→) where ci→ is the sequence of glass colors (c0→ corresponds to the lowest block and cn→ to the highest one).

Beacon beams cannot go through most blocks, but can go through bedrock (to allow beacons to be used in the Nether) and end portal frames.

Using just 15 colors of stained glass, It is possible to make all colors, for example; red + white stained glass above a beacon makes pink; in addition to this, the more white that is added, the lighter the color.
