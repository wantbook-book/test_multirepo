## Obtaining
### Breaking
Carpets can be mined using any tool, or without a tool. Unlike wool, carpets are not destroyed quicker when using shears.[1]

|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.15                |

### Natural generation
Igloo
White and light gray carpet can be found in igloos. If its basement generates (50% chance), red carpet can also be found.

Mansion
All carpet colors except orange and light blue‌[BE  only] generate within woodland mansions.

### Trading
Apprentice-level shepherd villagers have a 1⁄32 (3.125%) chance to sell one of 16 types of carpets as part of their trades. They sell 4 carpets of the same color for an emerald.

## Usage
Carpet has the same visual thickness as a pressure plate. It has a hitbox of 1⁄16 of a block and covers the entire surface of the block it is placed on. This thickness prevents mob spawning.

Carpet can be placed on any block, including non-solid blocks, except air and item frame‌[Java Edition  only]. When placed on grass or fern, they break and the carpet is placed on the block below. When placed on vines, the topmost block of vines breaks and the carpet is placed on the block below, any vines blocks below the first one don't break. It can even be placed over water blocks, but to do so you must target an adjacent block with a visible hitbox.

Carpet can be pushed and pulled by pistons but pops off if pushed onto a hole or pulled downward. It can also break falling sand and gravel.

Carpet is an opaque block but does not decrease light going through it. Because of this and the fact that it can be placed on any block, a common decorative strategy is to place carpet on a light-emitting block in the floor, illuminating a room and hiding the light source at the same time.

Carpets can be placed on top of fences and walls to allow the player to jump on top of them while still preventing animals and mobs from crossing. This is because mobs do not try jump over fences and walls, even with a carpet above. 

In Java Edition, if a campfire is placed beneath a beehive to pacify bees, the campfire can be placed below ground and a carpet placed over the campfire to protect bees from the fire. In Bedrock Edition, a carpet over a campfire removes the campfire's pacifying effect on bees.

If a carpet is placed so that it lays on top of a hopper, the hopper can still collect items through the carpet. This is because hoppers can collect items from less than a full block above in Java Edition, or less than 3⁄4 of a block above in Bedrock Edition.

Carpets can also be placed over other carpets. Mobs are unable to walk over two or more layers of carpets, because the mob's AI treats carpets as if they are air blocks. If a mob stands on a double carpet layer, it stays perfectly still.‌[Java Edition  only] Similarly, endermen are unable to teleport onto double carpet layers.

Carpets, similar to wool, dampens vibrations from sculk sensors. These include placing, breaking, and entities walking/jumping on. However, unlike wool, carpets dampen only horizontal vibration paths.

### Decorating llamas
All llama carpet patterns.
Llamas can be equipped with carpets in their carpet slot (). Each carpet color shows as a different patterned rug on the llama's back.

### Fuel
Carpet can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 0.335 items per carpet item.‌[Java Edition  only]
