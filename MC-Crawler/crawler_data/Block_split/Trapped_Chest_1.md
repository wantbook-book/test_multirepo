### Redstone component
Chests (left) and trapped chests (right) can be placed next to each other. Redstone dust configures itself to point toward trapped chests, but not toward regular chests.
See also: Redstone circuit

Trapped chests can be used to detect when their inventory is accessed by players.

A trapped chest is inactive while not being accessed, but activates when accessed by a player (see above). Accessing either part of a large trapped chest activates both halves of the large trapped chest. Mobs cannot access/activate a trapped chest, and a trapped chest is not activated by items moving into or out of it by droppers or hoppers.

While active, a trapped chest:

- powers any adjacentredstone dust, including beneath the trapped chest, to apower levelequal to the number of players accessing the trapped chest (maximum 15)
- powers any adjacentredstone repeatersfacing away from the trapped chest to power level 15
- strongly powers any full solid opaque block (stone, dirt, block of gold, etc.) beneath the trapped chest to a power level equal to the number of players accessing the trapped chest (maximum 15)
- activates any adjacentmechanism components, including above or below, such aspistons,redstone lamps, etc. Due to hoppers being locked by redstone activation, hoppers below a trapped chest do not take items from it while it is open.

An active trapped chest does not power any adjacent redstone comparators facing away from it. Redstone comparators can measure the block state of the trapped chest, producing a power level from 0 to 15 proportional to how full the trapped chest is. Anything else powered by an active trapped chest (including a block beneath it) can power redstone comparators normally.

### Piglins
Piglins become hostile toward players who open, break or interact with trapped chests.

### Fuel
Trapped chests can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per chest.

### Note blocks
Trapped chests can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sound.
