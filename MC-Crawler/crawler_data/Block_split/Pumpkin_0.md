When a pumpkin is pushed by a piston, it breaks and drops as an item. It cannot be pulled.

### Natural generation
Pumpkins naturally generate with the terrain in most biomes in the Overworld, in the form of random patches. They require only grass blocks with air above (clear of any plants such as flowers or short grass), and can generate regardless whether that grass block has a layer of snow cover. Practically speaking, this means that the occurrence of pumpkins in stony or sandy biomes, or in grassy biomes with few clear grass blocks, is comparatively rare. Each chunk has a 1⁄32 chance to generate a pumpkin patch, making naturally-generated pumpkins rarer than diamond ore. 

Pumpkins naturally generate in stem farm rooms in woodland mansions.

4 pumpkins generate naturally in woolen tents in pillager outposts.

Pumpkins generate naturally as pile (and in some farms) in taiga and snowy taiga‌[BE  only] villages.

### Farming
Main article: Tutorials/Pumpkin and melon farming
Pumpkin farming strategies parallel those of melons. Planted pumpkin seeds grow a central stem that, after maturing, generates pumpkins randomly on adjacent vacant dirt-based blocks (dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, grass block, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss block, mud or muddy mangrove roots). If a pumpkin is harvested without also cutting the central stalk, another pumpkin generates afterward without requiring replanting or waiting for the stalk to mature again.

Pumpkin stems take around 10 to 30 minutes to fully develop. They require a light level of 9 or higher to grow. Bone meal can be used on pumpkin stems to become fully-grown, but this does not produce a pumpkin immediately.

### Carving
A placed pumpkin can be made into a carved pumpkin by using shears, which drops 4 pumpkin seeds on Java Edition and 1 on Bedrock Edition. The targeted side becomes the face of the carved pumpkin, unless the top or bottom face of the pumpkin are targeted, in which case the carved side is on the side facing the player.

### Trading
Apprentice-level farmer villagers buy 6 pumpkins for an emerald as part of their trades.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

Apprentice-level farmer villagers have a 2⁄3 chance to buy 6 pumpkins for one emerald.‌[Java Edition  only]

### Composting
Placing a pumpkin or carved pumpkin into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

### Note blocks
Pumpkins can be placed under note blocks to produce didgeridoo sounds. This doesn't apply to carved pumpkins.[1]
