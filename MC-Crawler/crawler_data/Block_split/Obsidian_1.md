## Usage
Obsidian is useful for building explosion-resistant structures as it has, along with its crying variant, anvils and netherite blocks, a blast resistance of 1,200; the highest of all blocks obtainable in Survival mode. Obsidian also cannot be destroyed by the ender dragon, including when ender dragons traverse obsidian blocks.

These qualities make obsidian an extremely effective defensive block, and it is commonly used in many bases in multiplayer servers as protection from griefers.

Obsidian is, however, not immune to the wither. Although black wither skulls have merely the explosive power of a ghast fireball, blue wither skulls ignore blast resistance, which means they can destroy obsidian. The wither's body can also destroy obsidian, either through block-breaking behavior upon taking damage, or its dash attack‌[Bedrock Edition  only]. The wither is the only mob in the game that can break obsidian. 

Obsidian is one of the two blocks an end crystal can be placed on; the other is bedrock.

### Nether portals
Obsidian is used to create a nether portal frame, which is then ignited using fire. The frame must be a vertical rectangle any size from 4×5 to 23×23. The corners of the frame are not required for an operational portal.
