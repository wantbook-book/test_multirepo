### Decay
Farmland eventually decays into normal dirt if is dehydrated and nothing is planted in it. Additionally, a farmland block becomes a dirt block, regardless of its state of hydration, if any of the following occur:

- The player or any mob jumps/falls on the block (with a greater chance as falling speed increases).
	- The player can trample farmland even inAdventuremode.[9][10]
	- InJava Edition, mobs smaller than 0.512 cubic blocks cannot destroy farmland. This includesparrots,rabbits,chickens,bats,ocelots,cats,wolves,foxes,cave spiders,endermites,silverfish, baby mobs, smallslimes, and smallmagma cubes.
- Apistonarm is extended over a farmland block.
- A piston pushes a farmland block down.
- A solid block covers the top surface of the farmland block such as when pumpkin or melon blocks appear, or when trees grow.
- Anendermanteleports directly on top of a farmland block.

When farmland decays, any crops growing on the block are dropped as items, as if they were harvested.

A ravager does not turn farmland to dirt when stepping on it, but it does destroy all crops.
