### Hoppers
Campfires do not have an external inventory. Raw food cannot be loaded into the campfire with a hopper.

A hopper placed directly underneath a campfire pulls through any items dropped into the campfire. Any drops from a mob that dies in the campfire get pulled into the hopper.

### Bees
Placing a campfire under a beehive or bee nest allows players to harvest honey bottles or honeycomb without provoking the bees.
There must be unobstructed air between the campfire and the beehive or bee nest. Carpets are an exception.‌[Java Edition  only]

### Light source
Standard lit campfires emit a light level of 15. Like most other sources of light, campfires melt nearby snow and ice.

### Note blocks
Campfires can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sounds.

### Piston interactivity
In Bedrock Edition, pushing a campfire with a piston or sticky piston breaks it. Campfires cannot be pulled by sticky pistons.

In Java Edition, pistons do not interact with campfires. Campfires neither move nor break when pushed or pulled by pistons.
