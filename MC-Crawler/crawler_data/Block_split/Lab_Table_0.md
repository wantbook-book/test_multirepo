## Obtaining
Lab tables can be obtained from the Creative inventory in Minecraft Education. They cannot be obtained in Survival without commands. In Bedrock Edition, the world must also have "Education Edition" enabled.

### Breaking
A pickaxe is required to collect a lab table. If broken using a fist or any other tool, it drops nothing.

| Netherite | 0.45                  |
| Golden    | 0.35                  |


↑ Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.


## Usage
Using the lab table opens a 1×9 grid, where elements and compounds can be inserted to perform experiments. The locations of the items in the grid do not affect the outcome. When ready to conduct an experiment, clicking the Combine button initiates the process.

If the result is a viable product, the top images animate to indicate whether a liquid, gas, or solid has been produced. Shortly after, the menu closes, and the successful product appears on the table. If the combined materials did not create a viable product, the process results in a garbage item and one of few animations involving fire and/or explosions. In Bedrock Edition, the table sometimes catches fire when garbage is made, burning all items and flammable blocks, so not building it near trees is recommended.
