### Natural generation
Regular sandstone generates in deserts and beaches, compressed underneath several blocks of sand. Regular sandstone generates at noise cave entrances in desert and beach biomes.

Many structures that generate in deserts are made of sandstone. Desert wells are made of normal sandstone, desert villages, desert pyramids and warm underwater ruins are made greatly of sandstone. All the aforementioned structures use sandstone blocks, slabs, stairs, and walls.
