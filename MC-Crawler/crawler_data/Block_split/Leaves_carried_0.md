## Usage
### Appearance
In its base state, leaves_carried highly resembles actual leaves. There are, however, differences: the main difference is that it appears darker than normal leaves, which is due to them using a tint, despite the texture they use already being colored, rather than the grayscale that tinted blocks usually use. Specifically, this tint is the color  #48b518.

However, higher metadata versions of leaves_carried behave unexpectedly. Perhaps most interesting is metadata 1, which corresponds to spruce leaves, which uses a crafting table's side textures rather than anything relevant to leaves. This could be explainable through examination of terrain.png, however, this is yet to be done.[more information needed]

Metadata 1 (corresponding to spruce leaves) is tinted with  #619961, and metadata 2 (corresponding to birch leaves) is tinted with  #80a755. The behavior of metadata 3, which corresponds to what would eventually become jungle leaves in the same version that removes leaves_carried, is currently unknown.[more information needed]

### Functional differences from leaves
Despite very closely resembling leaves visually, leaves_carried do not decay.

Other differences, such as whether they drop saplings when broken without shears, or indeed drop anything at all, are unknown.[more information needed]
