#### Hoglin meat
 

In 1.16.0, two textures named hoglin_meat_raw and hoglin_meat_cooked were added. They are textured identically to raw beef and cooked beef, respectively.

### Entities and mobs
#### Gray tabby cat

In the vanilla resource pack, a texture file for a tamed gray tabby cat exists. However, it is completely unused and cannot be spawned in-game.

#### Tamed ocelot
In the vanilla resource pack, textures exist, along with the other cat textures, for an ocelot texture, as well as the texture for a tamed ocelot. Again, it is completely unused and cannot be spawned in-game.

#### Old nitwit villager and old nitwit zombie villager
Nitwit villagers have existed in Bedrock Edition from earlier versions alongside its zombie villager version, but remain unused. Its texture still exists in the game files.
Nitwit villager and zombie villager added in 1.10.0 but they are new villagers with a different ID and texture, which means the old nitwit villager and zombie villager textures are unused.

#### Clownfish
In the vanilla resource pack, there is a texture for a generic clownfish, which is completely unused, instead, clownfish are a variant of tropical fish.

### Other
#### Old Pocket Edition panorama
As of Bedrock Edition 1.2.0, a new panorama background is used, but the old panorama before 1.2.0 was not removed. Despite many updates to the main panorama, the (now unused) old panorama texture still exists.

## Status effects
Main article: Status effects
Some of the status effects in Bedrock Edition are unobtainable and can be obtained only by using inventory editing or /effect.

### Health boost
Health Boost was added to the game in v0.12.0. It gives extra health that can regenerate. It can be obtained only with commands.

## World generation
### Old world type
Main article: Old
The Old world type was created to provide smaller worlds on older or low-end devices that did not perform well with infinite worlds. As of beta 1.18.0.22, the Old world type was removed from being created.

### Nether in Old world type
Nether Portals cannot be activated in the Old world type unless converted to the Infinite world type. 

As of Alpha 0.16.0 build 5, commands can be used by players to access the Nether in the Old world type without converting it to Infinite by using commands /setblock or /fill with the Nether Portal.

The Nether in the Old world type looks like the normal Nether but is limited in size. It is the same size as the Overworld, which is 256×256 with a 128 block height. However, since the Nether and the Overworld have the same size, and traveling 1 block in the Nether is still equal to traveling 8 blocks in the Overworld, this leads to a problem that can make the game freeze or crash. This is the reason why the Nether can not be accessed in the Old world type. When the player goes to the Nether, a new Nether portal generates naturally in the Overworld, because a portal placed with commands is not counted. However, the player cannot make a nether portal normally.

### End in Old world type
The End Dimension was added, and alongside it the End in the Old world type. The End is inaccessible because strongholds never generate in the Old world type and building an end portal also does not work. The only way to access it is via block-placement commands such as /setblock and /fill.

Unlike the Nether in Old worlds, which can generate all structures, The End here generates just the main island and not the outer islands, due to the size limit of 256×256 blocks.

However, sometimes the End in the Old world type generates improperly, resulting in the central island not generating due to the border. If this happens, the ender dragon may get stuck in mid-air at the border, and the exit portal generates halfway or does not appear. The end gateway portal is also nonfunctional, due to the size limit.

These problems are the reasons why the End dimension is normally inaccessible, as the only way to go back to the Overworld is via cheats or death.

Snowy Mountains have a lower chance of spawning passive mobs during world generation than other biomes (7% versus 10%).Giant spruce taiga hills are a special case. in Java Edition, the game code sets the values setBaseHeight and setHeightVariation to define a "hilly" biome, but uses the same values as for its non-hill variant (giant spruce taiga), meaning there is absolutely no terrain difference between the two biomes. In Bedrock Edition, this biome generates as a hillier version of the giant spruce taiga, but uses the same trees as the giant tree taiga hills (with leaves only at the top), resulting in the differences between these biomes being non-terrain aspects like water color and temperature. | Giant tree taiga hillsDesert hillsJungle hillsSnowy mountains |  |

Similar to normal badlands,mineshaftsare capable of generating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Badlands plateau                                              |  |
| Modified Plateaus164, 167                          | Temperature:  Modified Badlands Plateau : 2.0 Shattered Savanna Plateau : 1.0                                                                         | Two rare variants of the plateau biomes, which are variants themselves. However, neither of these biomes closely resemble their counterparts.Compared to the average badlands plateau, the modified badlands plateau features more variable terrain and smaller plateaus, as if a larger plateau was weathered down over time. It is the second-rarest biome in the game, after the modified jungle edge.The terrain of the shattered savanna plateau biome is much less tame than its normal counterpart. It features incredibly large and steep mountains that jut out of the terrain, similar to the Shattered Savanna biome, albeit slightly smaller and gentler in comparison. In Bedrock Edition, shattered savanna plateaus are considered a temperate/lush biome, making foliage a vibrant green color and allowing rain to occur in them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Modified badlands plateauShattered savanna plateau            |  |
| Modified Wooded Badlands Plateau166                | Temperature: 2.0Oak trees, dead bushes, coarse dirt, dirt, terracotta                                                                                 | This biome features grass and oak trees on top of plateaus, much like its counterpart. However, the plateaus that generate here are generally smaller, allowing far less foliage to generate. The terrain is more erratic, and can be compared to that of the Modified Badlands Plateau biome. Eroded badlands generate instead of the desert alongside this biome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Modified wooded badlands plateau                              |  |
| Mushroom Field Shore15                             | Temperature: 0.9Mushrooms, huge mushrooms, mycelium, mooshrooms, buried treasure, shipwreck                                                           | Mushroom field shores represent the transition between mushroom fields and the ocean, forming long strips between the biomes as a "beach", hence the name. However, it does not generate if the ocean biome is a Deep Ocean. This biome also generates when a river meets a Mushroom Fields biome, similar to what frozen rivers do in snowy tundras. The terrain of this biome is much more flat and shallow than the main mushroom fields biome, though it contains many of the same features, such as a mycelium surface layer, huge mushrooms, and lack of hostile mobs, but shipwrecks and buried treasure can generate here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Mushroom field shore                                          |  |
