## Usage
Dirt's primary use is for farming, but due to its abundancy, it can also be used as a highly available building block.

### Crafting ingredient
| Name        | Ingredients | Crafting recipe |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Coarse Dirt | Dirt+Gravel | 4               |

### Farming
Dirt has the ability to grow saplings, sugar cane, mushrooms, sweet berries, and bamboo, which can be planted directly in dirt under appropriate conditions.

Using a hoe on dirt turns it into farmland, enabling wheat seeds, pumpkin seeds, melon seeds, potatoes, carrots, beetroot seeds, pitcher pods, and torchflower seeds to be planted on it.

### Dirt path
Using a shovel on dirt turns it into a dirt path.

### Grass and mycelium spreading
See also: Grass Block

When a dirt block is adjacent to a grass block and is exposed to a light level of at least 4, it is eventually converted into a grass block at random intervals.

Mycelium spreads in a similar fashion, but requires a light level of at least 9.

### Mud
Using a water bottle, splash water bottle or lingering water bottle will convert the dirt into mud.
