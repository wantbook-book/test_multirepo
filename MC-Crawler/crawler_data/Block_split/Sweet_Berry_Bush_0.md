## Obtaining
### Natural generation
Berry bushes commonly generate in taiga and snowy taiga biomes. Each chunk has a 1⁄12 chance to generate sweet berry bushes in random patches. In Java Edition, they also generate in both old growth pine taiga and old growth spruce taiga biomes.


### Breaking
See also: Fortune § Discrete random

Sweet berry bushes can be mined instantly with any tool or by hand. A mature sweet berry bush yields 2–3 sweet berries. On its third growth stage, it yields 1–2 sweet berries. Each level of Fortune can increase the amount of drops by 1.

### Harvesting
Sweet berries can be collected from a sweet berry bush by pressing the use control on it, yielding 1–2 sweet berries in its third growth stage, and 2–3 sweet berries in its final growth stage. After dropping the berries on the ground, the sweet berry bush reverts to its first growth stage.

## Usage
### Placement
Placing sweet berries on a grass block, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss block, mud, or muddy mangrove roots creates a small sweet berry bush that eventually becomes a fully grown sweet berry bush.

### Growth
A sweet berry bush grows through four stages after it is planted. Its first growth stage is a small bush without any berries. It becomes a grown plant in its second stage, and produces berries in its third and fourth growth stage. The bush needs to be in light level 9 or greater to grow. Using bone meal on it increases its growth stage by one, and at full maturity, ejects the sweet berry item. The bush can be placed on a 1 block high space, but it cannot grow with a full, non-transparent block immediately above it.

### Food
To eat sweet berries, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 2 () hunger and 0.4‌[JE  only] / 1.2‌[BE  only] hunger saturation.

### Composting
Placing sweet berries into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

### Breeding
Sweet berries can be fed to foxes to breed them. Foxes are similar to cats when being fed as a wild animal; a sudden movement by the player may cause the fox to flee even if the player holds sweet berries. A baby fox bred by a player trusts the player and does not flee.
