#### Cubic chunks
This refers to changing the chunk format to make chunks 16 blocks tall, allowing for infinite world height. Ryan Holtz discussed it with Erik Broes, but they decided they couldn't implement it, because of the difficulty of solving problems such as the occlusion of sky light.[79] The feature was previously rejected by Notch for similar reasons.[80]

### Blocks and items
#### 
Dinnerbone said on Twitter he would like to add weapons/tools that cannot be crafted, and could only obtained through treasure chests/trading, etc. For example, bows with faster drawback (somewhat implemented with the addition of Quick Charge), boots that increase health, or night vision helmets. However, the attribute system has to be finished first.[81][82][83][84]

Frost Walker and Mending were implemented as treasure enchantments in 1.9 as well as the Curses of Binding and Vanishing in 1.11, and tridents have been implemented in 1.13 as drowned-exclusive weapons, somewhat implementing this feature. In 1.16, treasure enchantments have also been made less accessible (therefore more rare) via nerfing AFK fishing, and the new Soul Speed enchantment is exclusively obtainable through bartering with piglins.

#### Steel
Multiple references to steel were made early on in the game's development. Notch had stated that it could be made using coal and iron ore,[85] and that it could be used for armor and weapons more powerful than iron.[86] In-game, flint and steel is crafted using iron ingots, considering the lack of steel and the need of a “fire striker”, despite the name of the former.

#### Spike block
Spikes received a mention in mid-2009 by Notch in a blog post.[85] These were originally planned for Java Edition Beta 1.7,[citation needed] working by extending and retracting spikes (and making them more "spike pistons" than anything),[citation needed] but were replaced by sticky pistons.[citation needed] On May 28, 2012, Dinnerbone stated that he'd like to add spike blocks, but is unsure of how to implement them.[87]

The 1.17 update implemented pointed dripstone, which can damage mobs and players that fall on them, or are crushed by them.

### User interface and modifications
#### Inventory changes
An inventory rewrite was originally added in the snapshot 14w07a for Java Edition 1.8, but a roadblock was hit and Mojang had to shelve the change before the release of 1.8.[88] Other changes to the inventory have been mentioned, including spectators can now look at people's inventory, visible health/armor bar on all players,[89] seeing players' GUI when spectating from their POV[90] and the return of shift-double-clicking.[91][92]

#### Off-hand changes
Changes with the off-hand slot added in Java Edition 1.9 were planned on being added to Minecraft sometime in the future.[93] Specifically, the player would no longer be able to attack or place blocks with any item in their off-hand slot, similar to Bedrock Edition. However, players would still be able to hold items in the off-hand slot, which still made the off-hand useful for maps and such. Also, blocking would still be able to be activated if the player is holding a shield in their off-hand. However, this regression was later retracted due to massive community backlash.

#### Friends list
Notch mentioned on his blog, The Word of Notch, that friends lists would be added after Beta 1.8.[94] The Minecraft documentary team of 2 Player Productions filmed a Keynote roadmap, containing these lines.[95][96] Kristoffer mentioned on Twitter that he is currently working on friends lists for Scrolls, then for other Mojang games. These will be available for players with Mojang accounts. At Minecon 2012, Jeb stated that it would be a large implementation on the server-side and will be used for all Mojang games, and that is a big project.[97][98]
With the release of 1.16.4, the social interactions menu functions somewhat like a friends menu but not exactly, but the Xbox account system currently used on Bedrock and Java has a friends system.

#### Resource packs
Grum mentioned that there may be easier customization of chat and sheep colors.[99]

Since 1.16, the "color" tag in raw NBT text has been able to accept hexadecimal colors:

/tellraw @s {"text":"proof","color":"#FF0000"}

Ryan Holtz stated that he wanted to improve the rendering system to allow for customizable models and animations.[100][101] Dinnerbone later stated that player models would not be able to be changed.[102]

#### Lua scripting
Lua Scripting was a feature mentioned by Notch as a way to create server-side modifications.[103] The server would be able to create custom commands, assign certain server functions to blocks, and create user groups. Players would not have to download scripts within or outside of the client, and therefore no client-side modifications will be necessary. Notch said that he wanted Lua to be an extension for Minecraft, but did not want Lua to turn Minecraft into a game engine.

Lua scripting has been further hinted at by Searge.[27]

Certain plugins such as Spigot or Bukkit support Lua scripting implementation into servers, however these plugins are not created by nor affiliated with Mojang Studios and thus are not an official means in which to implement Lua scripting.

#### 
Main article: Add-on § History
The Plugin API,[104][105] dubbed "Workbench", is a feature that allows mod developers to easily add more content to the game. In contrast to mods, plugins will not require any alteration of the minecraft.jar file itself, although they will also be slightly limited in their feature set.[106][107] The Bukkit team will help make the official Plugin API.[108]
