## Obtaining
### Breaking
A dandelion can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

A dandelion also breaks if water or lava runs over its location, if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

### Natural generation
Dandelions generate naturally on dirt and grass blocks in multiple biomes as part of vegetation features:


Plains
Sunflower Plains
Savanna
Savanna Plateau
Windswept Savanna
Snowy Plains
Meadow
Forest
Flower Forest‌[Java Edition  only]
Birch Forest
Old Growth Birch Forest
Taiga
Old Growth Pine Taiga
Old Growth Spruce Taiga
Snowy Taiga
Jungle
Bamboo Jungle
Sparse Jungle
Dark Forest
Windswept Hills
Windswept Gravelly Hills
Windswept Forest
River
Frozen River
The following additional biomes are also technically allowed to generate dandelions, although they very rarely or never generate grass blocks on the surface in normal worlds. As a result, dandelions can generate only in edge cases or custom worlds.


Beach
Snowy Beach
Stony Shore
Ocean
Deep Ocean
Cold Ocean
Deep Cold Ocean
Frozen Ocean
Deep Frozen Ocean
Lukewarm Ocean
Deep Lukewarm Ocean
Warm Ocean
Desert
Ice Spikes
Dripstone Caves
Deep Dark
Lush Caves‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
Grove‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
Snowy Slopes‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
Stony Peaks‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
Jagged Peaks‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
Frozen Peaks‌[Bedrock Edition  only]
In jungles, bamboo jungles, sparse jungles, savannas and savanna plateaus, dandelions are twice as common as in other biomes. In flower forests and meadows, dandelions only generate as part of gradients.

Natural dandelions are found in plains and savanna villages. Potted dandelions can also generate in woodland mansions.


### Post-generation
Main article: Flower § Post-generation
#### Java Edition
When bone meal is applied to a grass block in one of the biomes listed above (except those marked as ‌[Bedrock Edition  only]), dandelions have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area. In meadows and flower forests, dandelions can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains, sunflower plains, dripstone caves, and the deep dark, dandelions cannot generate in tulip-only areas.

#### Bedrock Edition
When bone meal is applied to a grass block in any biome except swamp and flower forest, dandelions have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 7×5×7 area. Unlike Java Edition, bone meal can generate dandelions anywhere within a meadow biome. In plains and sunflower plains dandelions cannot generate in tulip-only areas.

When bone meal is applied to a dandelion that has been placed on top of a grass block in any biome, more dandelions appear on top of nearby grass blocks. Poppies can also occasionally appear, and dandelions can occasionally appear when bone meal is applied to poppies. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.
