Bedrock cannot normally be broken in Survival mode with any tool. It can only be broken by hand in snapshot 22w13oneBlockAtATime and has a hardness value of 600.

However, it can be broken using glitches involving a piston, but it does not drop as an item.

### Natural generation
Bedrock comprises the five bottom-most layers of the Overworld in a rough pattern, although the top four layers are predominantly flat bedrock with only rare gaps, rendering the lowest, completely flat fifth layer (at Y=-64) mostly inaccessible.

In the Nether, bedrock comprises both the top and bottom four layers in a rough pattern. In both Java and Bedrock Editions, the patterns of bedrock are consistent in the Nether. At the top of the Nether, bedrock prevents the player from ascending above Y=127 without exploiting glitches, although in Java Edition the build limit extends to Y=255 in the Nether, meaning it is possible to build there. This space, known as the "Nether ceiling", consists entirely of flat bedrock and the occasional mushrooms. No mobs spawn here, as nothing can spawn on bedrock, although mobs can spawn on valid blocks placed by a player.

In the End, a single block of bedrock generates on top of each obsidian pillar, each topped with an end crystal. The bedrock remains after the destruction of the crystal (because it is indestructible), and is lit on fire indefinitely. Bedrock additionally comprises part of the exit portal at the center of the central island. Unlike in other dimensions, there is no bedrock floor at the bottom of the End, meaning it is possible to fall into the void without exploiting glitches.

An unlimited number of end gateways generate randomly across the outer End islands, each consisting of 12 blocks of bedrock.


### Post-generation
If the bedrock that makes up the exit portal is removed by any means, it regenerates when the ender dragon is defeated or re-summoned. 

An end gateway is generated on the central End island upon the death of each ender dragon, which is mostly made of bedrock. A total of 20 of these gateways generate in a circle centered on the exit portal in set positions. A corresponding end gateway is generated in the inner edge of the outer islands after an end gateway on the central island is activated for the first time.
