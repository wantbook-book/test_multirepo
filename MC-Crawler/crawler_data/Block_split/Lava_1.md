If the player is wearing armor enchanted with Fire Protection, they can last even longer. With the maximum bonus, the damage is small enough that the natural healing from a full hunger bar can outpace it,‌[JE  only] so a player could survive indefinitely as long as they have food and their armor holds up (non-netherite armor is damaged by lava). This maximum bonus can be obtained by wearing 2 pieces of armor with Fire Protection IV and 1 with Protection IV, or 1 piece of armor with Fire Protection IV and 3 with Protection IV.

#### Fire spread
Lava can cause fires by turning air blocks to fire blocks.

In order for air above lava to turn to fire, a block adjacent to the air has to be flammable, or one of the wood-constructed non-flammable blocks. Since catching fire depends on air blocks, even torches or lava itself can prevent a flammable block from catching fire.  Additionally, not all flammable or wood-constructed blocks can be ignited by lava.

The lava of any depth can start fires this way, whether or not it appears to have a current.

Additional conditions must be met, depending on the edition of Minecraft.

##### Java Edition






































































Example for JE. The orange area represents areas where air could catch flame if the gray and orange areas contain flammable blocks. The wood is all at a safe distance.



Air block must be in a 3×1×3 area right above the lava or in a 5×1×5 2 blocks above the lava.

An air block in the 5×1×5 area does not catch on fire if the 3×1×3 area is completely filled, even if the latter is filled with flammable blocks.

##### Bedrock Edition
The block to be set on fire must be in a 3×3×3 cube centered on a lava block, above which there must be either air or an ignitable block.

### Flow
See also: Fluid

Lava flows from "source blocks". Most streams or "lava-falls" come from a single source block, but lava lakes (including the "flood lava" in the bottom 10 layers) are composed entirely of source blocks. A source block can be captured only with a bucket.

In the Overworld and the End, lava travels 3 blocks in any horizontal direction from a source block. Lava flows far more slowly than water (1 block every 30 game ticks, or 1.5 seconds), and sourceless lava flows linger for a short time more. In the Nether, lava travels 7 blocks horizontally and spreads 1 block every 10 game ticks, or 2 blocks per second, which is half the speed as water in the Overworld. In all dimensions, lava spreading uses the same mechanic as water: for every adjacent block it can flow into it tries to find a way down that is reachable in four or fewer blocks from the block it wants to flow to. When found, the flow weight for that direction is set to the shortest path distance to the way down. (This can result in lava flows turning toward dropoffs that they cannot reach in the Overworld and the End.)

Flowing lava destroys the following in its path: saplings, cobwebs, tall grass, dead bushes, wheat, flowers, mushrooms, snow on ground (but snow blocks are immune), lily pads, vines, levers, buttons, all three types of torches, redstone, repeaters, end rods, and rails. Sugar canes hold back lava, but disappear if the sugar cane's water source is destroyed by the lava. Lava also slows down entities, including those that are normally immune to lava damage.

Using redstone wire, a one-block lava flow can be redirected by supplying power to the source block, which causes it to reset the flow toward the now-nearest terrain depression. It cannot, however, be reversed. This re-calculation is made because of the redstone wire when toggled changes the block from redstone (on) to redstone (off). Whenever a block updates on any side of the lava, the lava re-calculates where to flow, but does not cut off its current direction of flow. In Bedrock Edition using the /setblock command can be used to create stationary lava without the use of barriers. 

Flowing lava can push entities.
