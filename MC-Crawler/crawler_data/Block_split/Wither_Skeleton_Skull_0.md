## Obtaining
### Breaking
A wither skeleton skull can be mined using any item,[1] and drops itself when broken.

| Block    | Wither Skeleton Skull |
|----------|-----------------------|
| Hardness | 1                     |
|          | Breakingtime (secs)   |
| Default  | 1.5                   |

If a wither skeleton skull is pushed by a piston or comes in contact with water or lava, it breaks off as an item.

When destroyed by an explosion, the wither skeleton skull always drops as an item.

### Mob loot
A wither skeleton has a 2.5% chance of dropping a wither skeleton skull when killed by a player or a tamed wolf. The chance is increased by 1% per level of Looting, for a maximum of 5.5% with Looting III. In Bedrock Edition, the chance is increased by 2% per level of Looting, for a maximum of 8.5% with Looting III.

A wither skeleton skull is always dropped by a wither skeleton if it dies due to a charged creeper's explosion. In Bedrock Edition, if multiple mobs are killed by the same charged creeper, all of them drop their heads,[2] however in Java Edition only one mob selected at random drops its head.[3]

|---------------------|----------------|------------------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
|                     |                | Default                | Looting I | Looting II | Looting III |
| Wither Skeleton(JE) | 2.5%–5.5%[d 1] | 1 (2.5%)               | 1 (3.5%)  | 1 (4.5%)   | 1 (5.5%)    |
| Wither Skeleton(BE) | 2.5%–8.5%[d 1] | 1 (2.5%)               | 1 (4.5%)  | 1 (6.5%)   | 1 (8.5%)    |
| Wither Skeleton     | 100%[d 2]      | 1                      | 1         | 1          | 1           |


↑ a b Only dropped when kill credit is given to the player

↑ Only when killed by a charged creeper. In Java Edition, only one skull or head drops per charged creeper explosion, even if multiple mobs are killed by it.


## Usage
### Decoration
Wither skeleton skulls can be oriented in 16 different directions on top of a block, and 4 directions on the sides of blocks, similar to signs. They can be placed on top of, or beside each other by shift clicking.

### Wearing
See also:  § Gallery

The player can wear wither skeleton skulls, similarly to pumpkins or helmets. This overlays the second layer of the player's skin.

#### Disguise
Unlike some other heads and skulls, wearing a wither skeleton skull does not reduce the detection range for wither skeletons.

In Bedrock Edition, wearing a wither skeleton skull makes the player invisible to other players on a locator map.

### Withers



















Wither build configuration


Withers can be spawned by placing soul sand or soul soil in a T shape, and putting 3 wither skeleton skulls on top of the T. The T can be horizontal or vertical. The last block placed must be one of the three wither skeleton skulls. A dispenser can also create a wither, by placing the final wither skeleton skull onto soul sand directly in front of and below it.

### Dispensers
A dispenser can equip a wither skeleton skull on a player, mob, or armor stand with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing.

Dispensers can also complete the construction of a wither.
