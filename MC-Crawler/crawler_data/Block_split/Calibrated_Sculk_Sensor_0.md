# Calibrated Sculk Sensor
A calibrated sculk sensor is a craftable variant of sculk sensor. Similarly to its counterpart it detects vibrations, but with twice the range, and can detect multiple vibrations in quicker succession. It outputs a signal on all sides except for its input, which can receive power to make the sensor only listen to specific vibrations, depending on the input signal strength.

## Obtaining
### Breaking
Calibrated sculk sensors can be broken with any tool, but can be broken faster with a hoe. They drop experience when broken. When broken by an item that is enchanted with Silk Touch, a calibrated sculk sensor drops itself.

## Usage
The calibrated sculk sensor is different from the basic sculk sensor in multiple ways:

- It can detect vibrations within adistanceof 16 blocks, instead of 8.
- It has a cooldown of 1 second instead of 2.
- It can be filtered (see below) to only react to some sounds.

### Filtering
When a redstone signal powers a calibrated sculk sensor on its crystalized side, the sensor will be filtered to only respond to vibrations that match the strength of that signal. Every vibration in the game has a frequency associated with it, and every vibration frequency directly matches a specific redstone signal strength. So, for example, a vibration with a frequency of 5 matches the redstone signal with a strength of 5.

| Redstone |        | Sounds with that frequency                                                                                              |
