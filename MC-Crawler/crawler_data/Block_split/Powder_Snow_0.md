# Powder Snow
Powder snow is a block found in snowy slopes and grove biomes, or collected from snowfall using cauldrons. Players and most mobs fall through powder snow and take freezing damage within it, but leather boots can be worn to stand on and climb through it as well as gain freezing immunity. Powder snow can only be obtained using a bucket.

## Obtaining
### Natural generation
Powder snow naturally generates in groves and snowy slopes in strip formations. Powder snow cannot have a snow layer placed on it.

Powder snow can also naturally generate in certain rooms in trial chambers.‌[upcoming]


### Cauldrons
Main article: Tutorials/Powder snow farming
A cauldron in a snowy biome under open sky fills with powder snow when it is snowing. Powder snow can then be picked up from this cauldron with an empty bucket.

### Bucket
Using a powder snow bucket places powder snow; placed powder snow can be picked up again with an empty bucket. These actions can be automated using a dispenser. When picked up, breaking particles appear.‌[Java Edition  only][1]

### Breaking
Powder snow does not drop anything when mined, even with Silk Touch, and tools do not speed up mining.[2][3]

| Block    | Powder Snow         |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 0.25                |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 0.4                 |

Powder snow is broken by water or lava, or when shot with a Flame-enchanted bow.

## Usage
The frosty vignette when a player is within powder snow.
All entities (except rabbits, endermites, silverfish, shulkers, vexes and foxes) fall through powder snow and move much slower in it, similar to cobwebs. Powder snow does not cause suffocation damage.

Mobs, armor stands or players wearing leather boots, however, do not fall through powder snow. In this case, the snow behaves as scaffolding when the player sneaks or crouches while on the block and jumps while inside of the block. Regardless of if the entity is wearing leather boots, all fall damage is negated when falling on top of powder snow. It is impossible to climb out of powder snow without leather boots. While moving through powder snow, snowflake particles appear.

Most walking mobs (except for goats) treat powder snow as normal solid blocks while pathfinding, similar to trapdoors, allowing them to voluntarily walk into it, and fall through it if possible.[4] Goats avoid powder snow, although they are not immune to falling through it and taking freezing damage.

If an entity that is on fire touches powder snow, powder snow cools it down as the powder snow melts.

Being fully inside a block causes a thick fog effect around the point of view. Players in Spectator mode can see through powder snow without any fogging effect.

When powder snow is on top of grass blocks, mycelium or podzol, the blocks below change to a snowy texture, similar to when snow layers are on top;[5] they revert to their default textures when the powder snow is removed. This change can be detected by observers.
