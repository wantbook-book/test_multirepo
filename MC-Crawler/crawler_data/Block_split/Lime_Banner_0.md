↑ Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.


A banner also breaks and drops itself as an item if the block the banner is attached to is moved, removed, or destroyed.

### Trading
Expert-level cartographer villagers always offer to sell 1 or 2 blank banners of a random color for 3 emeralds. Expert-level shepherd villagers have a 2⁄7 chance of offering the same trade.‌[Java Edition  only]

In Bedrock Edition, expert-level cartographer and shepherd villagers both offer to sell one of 16 blank banners for 3 emeralds as part of their trades.

## Usage
Overlapping block on a banner.
Overlapping on a wall mounted banner.
There are 16 colored blank banners, and numerous patterns each available in each of the 16 colors. A banner can feature up to 6 different patterns. The top layer of a banner (or the last pattern added) can be washed off by using it on a cauldron containing water.

Banners, much like signs, can be placed both on the ground facing in any direction, or on a wall. They gently sway as if affected by a breeze, regardless of dimension or location. 

Banners have no collision mask as they are completely non-solid, so entities can move through them.

Other blocks (including other banners) can be placed on any edge of a banner's hitbox, which is only one block high despite the banner appearing as two blocks tall. This makes it possible to overlap another solid block on the top half of a banner for floor banners, or the bottom half of wall banners.

When a banner is placed on the side of a block, its position is set by the top block, and it is possible to place it so it appears half buried.

Banners can also be placed in item frames, where they simply appear as their item model.

Water and lava flow around banners. In Bedrock Edition, banners can be waterlogged.

- Water can be placed below wall banners
- Water flows around a banner on the ground

Lava can create fire in air blocks next to banners as if the banners were flammable, but the banners do not burn (and cannot be burned by other methods). Banners also cannot be moved by pistons.

If a banner is renamed on an anvil, it retains its name when a pattern is added, but not when a pattern is removed.
