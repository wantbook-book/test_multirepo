## Obtaining
### Breaking
Soul soil drops as an item when broken with any tool or by hand, but a shovel is the fastest way to break it.

A soul campfire, when broken without using a Silk Touch tool, drops a block of soul soil.

↑ Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.


### Natural generation
Soul soil generates naturally in the soul sand valley biome.


### Renewability
Since soul campfires can be crafted with renewable soul sand but drop soul soil when broken without Silk Touch, this makes soul soil renewable as well.[1]

## Usage
Unlike soul sand, soul soil does not slow mobs down, does not create bubble columns and does not allow items to fall through into a hopper.

### Fire
Fire lit on soul soil becomes soul fire.

### Withers



















The wither build configuration (with soul soil).


4 blocks of soul soil (or soul sand) are used in the construction of a wither.

### Basalt
Lava on top of soul soil and directly adjacent to blue ice turns into basalt.  Re-producing basalt this way can comprise a "basalt generator."

A simple basalt generator.
