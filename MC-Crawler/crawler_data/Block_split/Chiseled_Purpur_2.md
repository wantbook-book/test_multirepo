### Old wooden slab
Main article: Petrified Oak Slab
Before normal wooden slabs were added, another type of wooden slab existed with stone characteristics.

### More explorer maps
Despite ocean explorer maps, woodland explorer and buried treasure maps being the only explorer maps that can be obtained in game, other explorer maps actually exist in the game files, and can be obtained only via inventory editing. These maps being:

- Village Explorer Map: Shows the nearest village; the reason why this map is not obtainable is that it sometimes shows the nearest village from the player, and is sold by the cartographer villager who also spawns in the village, making this explorer map no more useful than a locator map because it shows the current location of the village that the player just found.
- Mineshaft explorer map: Shows the nearest abandoned mineshaft, for normal or badlands variant.
- Temple explorer map: Shows one of these structures if they are nearby:
	- Jungle pyramid
	- Desert pyramid
	- Igloo
	- Swamp hut
- Stronghold explorer map: Shows the nearest stronghold. This explorer map often leads the player to a village, because strongholds in Bedrock Edition have a high chance to generate underneath a village's well or meeting point. This can be an alternative way to find strongholds beside using aneye of ender.
- Ruins explorer map: Shows the nearestocean ruins.
- Shipwreck explorer map: Shows the nearestshipwreck.
- Pillager outpost explorer map: Shows the nearestpillager outpost.
- Fortress explorer map: Shows the nearestNether fortress. Unlike other explorer maps, this map uses the Nether map layout instead of the explorer map layout, which is a static gray color with a destination pointer that stays in one place but spinning wildly like the player pointer.
- End City Explorer Map: Shows nearestend city. Unlike other explorer maps, this map uses the End map layout, instead of the explorer map layout.

These explorer maps, named "Unknown Maps", have the same scale as the woodland and ocean explorer maps. However, when held, its name is changed to Map 0 and shows a green triangle to mark the destination structure.
These explorer maps have normal map textures but have the same layout as a woodland and ocean explorer maps, which are brown. They use stripes for bodies of water, and a sort of tan color for landmasses.
If the player obtains these unused explorer maps in an incorrect dimension, ex: obtaining a fortress explorer map in the Overworld causes the game to freeze and/or eventually crash.

### Potions and tipped arrows

- 3 - Fern (looks identical to fern, turns intodouble tallgrasswhen bone mealed)

## Resources
There are no items, placeable blocks, or /summon mobs for these, as they appear only as textures, meaning they are currently without use in-game. Some of these are from the Education Edition of Minecraft, and their textures still exist in Bedrock Edition.

### Blocks
#### Chalkboard
Chalkboard comes in 3 variants: slate, poster, and board.

#### Camera
The camera's texture still remains, despite it no longer existing as a block, although it was re-added in beta 1.12.0.2, being obtainable with the /give command, but only as an item. However, the ability to get the camera using commands were removed again in beta 1.13.0.1. It is used to take photos because back then, phones didn't have the ability to take screenshots. Cameras are once again obtainable with /give in beta 1.16.100.54, and can now take screenshots. However it was removed again in beta 1.16.100.58.

#### Old rose
An old rose.
The exclusive blue rose was removed from the game, but its texture still remains as flower_rose_blue.png

#### Spawn agent


Does not spawn an agent unless connected to a WebSocket server.

#### Minecart with furnace


The minecart with furnace exists in Java Edition, while in Bedrock Edition it appears as an inventory icon texture.

#### Quiver


The quiver was going to be used to hold arrows, but it was never implemented; Dinnerbone said that holding arrows in the offhand felt more natural.[2]

#### Ruby

Rubies were supposed to be in the game, but since Dinnerbone was color-blind and could not tell the difference between it and redstone, it was scrapped, leaving only a texture. It was implemented in Minecraft Earth, with a completely different use and texture.
