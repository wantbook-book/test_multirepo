Granite can generate in the Overworld in the form of ores. 

In Bedrock Edition, granite attempts to generate in two batches in all biomes in the Overworld. The first batch generate 2 times per chunk in ores of size 0-864, from elevations 0 to 60. The second batch has 1⁄6 chance to generate ores of size 0-864, from elevation 64 to 128. In Bedrock Edition, granite can replace stone, andesite, diorite, polished andesite‌, polished diorite‌, polished granite‌. In Java Edition, granite can replace stone, andesite, diorite, tuff, and deepslate.

In addition, granite generates as part of large copper ore veins, coral reefs‌[Bedrock Edition  only], and in desert village armorer houses.
