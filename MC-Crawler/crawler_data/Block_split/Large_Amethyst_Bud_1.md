### Decoration
They can also be placed on certain other types of blocks for decoration. The block must be solid and have at least side sides that form a full surface: for example, they can be placed on the bottom of stairs (or top of upside down stairs), but not on their side, or top. They can also be placed on the bottom of bottom slabs and on the top of top slabs. Of blocks that meet these criteria, some are still excluded.

Amethyst clusters can't be placed on:

- allnon-solid blocks;
- blocks without any full surfaces, likefences,fence gates,walls,glass panes,iron bars,lightning rods,chains,heads,grindstones,bells,lanterns,cauldrons,anvils,conduits,decorated pots,chests,pointed dripstone;
- leaves;
- big dripleaf;
- honey blocks;
- chorus flowers.

### Light
Small, medium and large amethyst buds give off a light level of 1, 2 and 4 respectively, while amethyst clusters give off a light level of 5.

### Sound
Uniquely among other blocks an amethyst cluster in all its growth stages makes a quiet overlay sound when generally interacted with as well as its block breaking sound when hit with a projectile.
