# Obsidian
Obsidian is a block found naturally in all dimensions, and created when water flows over a lava source. It has high hardness and blast resistance, rendering it immune to normal explosions. Obsidian is used for crafting and to make the frame for a nether portal. It can only be obtained by mining it with a diamond or netherite pickaxe.

↑ Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.


Enchanting a pickaxe with Efficiency and using a beacon with Haste both drastically decrease the mining time. See the obsidian farming tutorial for more information.

8 obsidian are dropped by an ender chest when broken with a pickaxe not enchanted with Silk Touch.

### Natural generation
Naturally occurring obsidian.
Water pouring onto lava springs, forming obsidian.
Obsidian generates naturally in all dimensions:

- Overworld:
	- Obsidian generates as part ofruined portals.
	- A single obsidian block generates in some types ofocean ruinbuildings.
	- Obsidian generates inwoodland mansionswith adiamond blockconcealed by it. These are found in the secret "obsidian room" and "lava room", on the 2nd or 3rd floors.
- The Nether:
	- Obsidian generates as part of ruined portals.
- The End:
	- Solidobsidian pillarscan be found on the End's main island, generating all the way down to Y=0.
	- 26 blocks of obsidian generate as a part of theend shipin anend city.

### Bartering
Piglins may barter a block of obsidian when given a gold ingot with a chance of 8.71%.

### Post-generation
Using a water spring to mine obsidian.
Obsidian is formed when flowing water touches a lava source block, and it can be found naturally where water from a spring or aquifer has flowed over a nearby lava pool. This provides a renewable way of obtaining obsidian, as lava can be farmed via cauldrons under pointed dripstone.

Obsidian is created when a nether portal is generated in the Nether or the Overworld. This portal can then be mined, providing another way of obtaining obsidian renewably. In Java Edition, if a nether portal is generated midair, 4 extra obsidian is generated at the bottom of the portal.

When an entity enters the End via an end portal, it always spawns on a platform consisting of 25 obsidian. This platform can then be mined, and regenerates whenever an entity enters the End, providing another way of obtaining obsidian renewably. Obsidian pillars also regenerate when the ender dragon respawns.
