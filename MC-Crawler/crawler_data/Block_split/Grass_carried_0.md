## Obtaining
grass_carried is only known to be obtainable through the use of inventory editors and other external tools. If placed in a world, the block can be mined instantly with any item, but it does not drop anything regardless of the method used.

## Usage
### Appearance
grass_carried obviously highly resembles the actual grass block. However, there are two key differences between it and normal grass blocks:

- The top texture is a noticeably different color, and in fact matches the side texture much more than normal grass blocks.
	- This is due to this block using a pre-tinted texture, whereas the normal grass block uses a grayscale texture with a constant tint.
- While grass blocks use thedirttexture on the bottom,grass_carrieduses the side texture on the bottom:

### Functional differences from grass blocks
Despite very closely resembling the grass block visually, grass_carried has notable functional differences from normal grass blocks:

- It can be broken instantly.[2]
- It does not drop anything at all when broken.[2]
- It does not have an icon in the inventory.[3]
- It cannot be turned intofarmland.[4]
- Blocks which require a dirt-like block below them to exist, such asflowersandsugar cane, cannot be placed on it.[4]
- Placing an opaque block on top on it does not gradually convert it to dirt.
