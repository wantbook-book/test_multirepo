## Obtaining
### Breaking
A piglin head can be mined using any item,[1] and drops itself when broken.

| Block    | Piglin Head         |
|----------|---------------------|
| Hardness | 1                   |
|          | Breakingtime (secs) |
| Default  | 1.5                 |

If a piglin head is pushed by a piston or comes in contact with water or lava, it breaks off as an item.

When destroyed by an explosion, the piglin head always drops as an item.

### Mob loot
Piglin heads are always dropped by a piglin if it dies due to a charged creeper's explosion. In Bedrock Edition, if multiple mobs are killed by the same charged creeper, all of them drop their heads, however in Java Edition only one mob selected at random drops its head.[2]

|        |             | Default                | Looting I | Looting II | Looting III |

↑ Only when killed by a charged creeper.


## Usage
### Decoration
Piglin heads can be oriented in 16 different directions on top of a block, and 4 directions on the sides of blocks, similar to signs. They can be placed on top of, or beside each other by shift clicking.

When placed and powered by redstone, the piglin head flaps its ears (2 times per second for the right ear and 2.5 times per second for the left ear). The same animation occurs when worn by a (horizontally) moving player, zombie, skeleton, or armor stand (note: the animation does not play if the NoGravity tag is set to 1)

### Wearing
See also:  § Renders

The player can wear piglin heads, similarly to pumpkins or helmets. This overlays the second layer of the player's skin.

#### Disguise
Wearing a piglin head reduces the detection range for piglins to 50% of the normal range. This is similar to (and stacks with) the reductions in detection range from sneaking and from the Invisibility status effect.

In Bedrock Edition, wearing any a piglin head makes the player invisible to other players on a locator map.

### Dispensers
A dispenser can equip a piglin head on a player, mob, or armor stand with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing.

### Crafting ingredient
| Ingredients                   | Crafting recipe | Description         |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Piglin Head +Gunpowder+AnyDye |                 | Forms Creeper shape |

### Enchantments
Piglin heads can receive the following enchantments, but only through an anvil.

| Name               | Max level | Method |
|--------------------|-----------|--------|
| Curse of Binding   | I         | Anvil  |
| Curse of Vanishing | I         | Anvil  |

### Note blocks
Placing a piglin head above a note block causes the note block to play the piglin's ambient sound when activated.

The block below the note block does not affect the mob sound it creates.
