## Obtaining
### Breaking
End stone can be obtained using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

| Block     | End Stone             |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| Hardness  | 3                     |
| Tool      |                       |

| Default   | 15                    |
| Wooden    | 2.25                  |
| Stone     | 1.15                  |

| Netherite | 0.5                   |

↑ Times are for unenchanted tools as used by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking Speed.


### Natural generation
A large island consisting entirely of end stone.
End stone is found only in the End, where it makes up all the floating islands that generate in the dimension.


### Post-generation
#### Exit portal
The 16 end stone blocks under the edge of the exit portal are replaced when the ender dragon is respawned, and again when it is killed. Because end crystals, which are used to respawn the dragon, are renewable, this does make end stone renewable as well.

End gateways generate a small floating island of end stone when an entity travels through, for the entity to land on if there are no valid locations.[verify]

If an exit portal exists at a different position from the world origin (for example, an old exit portal from before 1.9), it will be completely converted into end stone if the ender dragon is re-summoned.

## Usage
End stone has a blast resistance of 9, which is 3 more than that of ordinary stone. This is the highest blast resistance of any block movable by pistons besides anvils‌[Bedrock Edition  only], ancient debris and block of netherite. It also cannot be picked up by endermen and cannot be destroyed by the ender dragon. In addition, it is the only block on which chorus flowers can be planted.
