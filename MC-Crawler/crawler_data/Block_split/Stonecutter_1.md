### Changing profession
If a village has a stonecutter that has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby villager who has not yet chosen a job site block has a chance to change their profession to a stone mason.

### Note blocks
Stonecutters can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass drum" sounds.
