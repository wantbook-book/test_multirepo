## Obtaining
### Breaking
Warped roots can be mined instantly with any tool. They drop themselves when broken. Flower pots containing warped roots drop both the flower pot and warped roots when broken.

| Block    | Warped Roots        |

### Natural generation
Warped roots generate often in warped forest biome in the Nether.


### Mob loot
An enderman holding warped roots drops the block upon death.

### Post-generation
Applying bone meal to warped nylium causes warped roots to appear on nearby warped or crimson nylium.

## Usage
### Decoration
All of the blocks that warped roots can be placed on.
Warped roots are decorative blocks. They can be planted on the same blocks that warped fungi can be placed on. Warped roots can be planted in a flower pot, which gives them a different texture.

### Composting
Warped roots can also be used on a composter, with a 65% chance of increasing the level by 1.
