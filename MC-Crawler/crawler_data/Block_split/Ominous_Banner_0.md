A ominous banner also breaks and drops itself as an item if the block the banner is attached to is moved, removed, or destroyed.

### Natural generation
Ominous banners are carried by raid captains. They are located in pillager outposts.

In Java Edition, the ominous banner cannot be crafted or copied because the design uses 8 patterns.

In Bedrock Edition, the illager banner is a separate type that cannot be placed in a loom.

Ominous banners have the following pattern:




White banner‌[JE  only]

- Cyan Lozenge
- Light Gray Base
- Gray Pale
- Light Gray Bordure
- Black Fess
- Light Gray Per Fess
- Light Gray Roundel
- Black Bordure

Separate type entirely‌[BE  only]

### Mob loot
Illagers that spawn carrying an ominous banner‌[JE  only] / illager banner‌[BE & edu  only] always drop it upon death.

### Crafting ingredient
Since ominous banners have more than six patterns, adding it to the shield will cause the banner to be reduced to six patterns on the shield.

### Fuel
Ominous banners can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per banner.

### Note blocks
Ominous banners can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sounds.

### Looms
