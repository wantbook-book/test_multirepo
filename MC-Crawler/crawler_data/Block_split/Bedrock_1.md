## Usage
Bedrock generates at the bottom of the Overworld and the Nether in order to prevent players from falling into the void. 

The bedrock ceiling in the Nether was intended to prevent players from accessing the Nether ceiling, which was meant to be an empty out-of-bounds area where players cannot build. This remains true in Bedrock Edition. However, in Java Edition 1.2.1, the world height was doubled from 127 to 255, a change which was applied in all three dimensions, allowing players to build on the Nether ceiling. Due to the number of players taking advantage of this change, it was decided by Mojang that this was to be treated as an intended feature.[1]

Bedrock generates as part of important structures in the End, including crucial elements of the ender dragon fight, as well as the gateways and the exit portals, in order to prevent them from being broken and keep them accessible and usable.

Mobs do not spawn on bedrock. Endermen are unable to place the block they are holding onto bedrock.

Beacons treat bedrock as a transparent block, meaning their beams can pass through it, allowing beacons to be used in the Nether.

In the End, any fire on bedrock never extinguishes naturally, similar to netherrack.

### Trapping the wither
Main article: Tutorials/Wither cage
Since bedrock is indestructible in Survival, it can be used against withers. Certain configurations of bedrock (Such as that found under the exit portal) can be used to securely trap withers by spawning them below the bedrock. The wither can then either be easily killed, utilized to break blocks automatically, or used to farm wither roses.

### End crystal
Bedrock is one of the only two blocks on which end crystals can be placed, the other being obsidian.

Placing an end crystal on bedrock in the End sets it on fire.

### Note blocks
Note blocks can be placed above bedrock to produce "bass drum" sounds.

### Piston interactivity
Bedrock is unable to be pushed or pulled by either of the piston variants (regular or sticky).
