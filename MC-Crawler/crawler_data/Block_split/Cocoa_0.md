## Obtaining
In Java Edition, cocoa beans are only obtained through the natural generation of cocoa pods, while in Bedrock Edition, they can also be found in bonus chests, from fishing inside the jungle, bamboo jungle and sparse jungle biomes and during a trading with a wandering trader.

Cocoa beans come from cocoa pods, which are found on the trunks of normal-sized naturally-generated jungle trees in jungle, bamboo jungle and sparse jungle biomes.

The block itself can be obtained by inventory editing or add-ons in Bedrock Edition.


### Breaking
Cocoa pods can be mined with any item, but axes are the quickest. Fully grown cocoa pods drop 3 cocoa beans. Using a tool enchanted with Fortune does not increase the amount of cocoa beans dropped.

### Fishing
Cocoa beans can be obtained from fishing in a jungle in Bedrock Edition.

### Trading
Wandering traders may sell 3 cocoa beans for an emerald during a trading in Bedrock Edition.

## Usage
### Farming
A somewhat efficient cocoa pod farm, minimizing space and wood use.
Main article: Tutorials/Cocoa bean farming
Placing cocoa beans on the side of a jungle log plants a new cocoa pod. The log does not need to be attached to a tree. A cocoa pod can be placed on jungle logs, jungle wood, stripped jungle logs and stripped jungle wood.

Cocoa has three stages of growth. During its first stage, the pod is small and green. In the second stage, the plant is bigger and colored tan. In its last stage, the pod is even larger and orange. The cocoa block has a 20% chance to grow a stage when receiving a random tick, giving it an average time of 5 minutes and 41 seconds per stage. When destroyed in the first two stages, the pod yields only one cocoa bean. When destroyed in the third stage, it gives 3 cocoa beans. Bone meal can be used to force the cocoa pod forward by one growth stage. Cocoa pods burst and drop their beans when struck by flowing water, pushed by a piston or if their log or wood are removed by any means.

### Composting
Placing cocoa beans into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. In Bedrock Edition, cocoa beans are accepted as a direct substitute of brown dye in many recipes.
