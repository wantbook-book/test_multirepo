### Storage
A decorated pot can store up to a stack of a single type of item. Unlike other containers, decorated pots have no GUI; items are inserted by interacting with the pot or by using droppers or hoppers. The only ways to retrieve stored items is by breaking the pot or by using hoppers and minecarts with hopper.

Decorated pots crafted without sherds can also serve as compact storage for bricks, as they are stackable, each can be crafted from four bricks and can be broken down into four bricks.

A redstone comparator can be used to measure the number of stored items.
