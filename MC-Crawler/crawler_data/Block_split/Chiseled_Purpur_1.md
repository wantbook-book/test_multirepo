## Blocks and items

  

This section is missing information about Add a section dedicated to the unobtainable item forms of blocks (analogous to those removed in Java Edition: Java Edition removed features#Blocks previously obtainable as items). 
Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page.


### Old stonecutter
Main article: Stonecutter (old)

Bedrock Edition 1.10.0 introduced the stonecutter with the model and texture similar to the Java Edition stonecutter, however, the new stonecutter does not replace the old stonecutter, as the old stonecutter was removed only from the creative inventory and commands. It is still available if the player already had it in a world prior to 1.10.0 or uses inventory editing.

### Lava in cauldron
Cauldrons can be used to store lava, but always filled by 3⁄3 level. However, using /setblock or /fill command with different data values can obtain a cauldron with 1⁄5 through 4⁄5 level filled by lava, which normally cannot happen due to the fact that dying leather armor and filling glass bottles is not possible with lava.

### Glowing obsidian

Main article: Glowing Obsidian
Glowing obsidian blocks were part of the now obsolete Nether reactor. It emits a soft red glow at light level 12, and drops a single obsidian when broken with a diamond pickaxe. It can be obtained only by using inventory editors or a Silk Touch enchanted pickaxe. As of 0.12.1, this block does not generate anymore. The block may still be obtained using inventory editors or by retaining it from previous worlds before the update.

### reserved6

Main article: reserved6

reserved6 was a technical block used by the player's hotbar to reference inventory slots. Its regular block/item form has never been obtainable without the use of glitches or inventory editing.

### Nether Reactor Core

Main article: Nether Reactor Core
The functionality of the Nether Reactor was removed in Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha. However, the reactor core block still exists in-game and can be obtained through inventory editing or by retaining it from previous worlds before the update. It now drops its ingredients, and cannot be obtained though normal methods or with Silk Touch. Prior to v0.12.1, they were used to activate the nether reactor. Tapping on it would activate the reactor if built correctly. When the core is activated for the nether reactor structure, the cobblestone and the blocks of gold are both replaced with glowing obsidian.

### Paintings
In v0.5.0 alpha, with the addition of paintings to Pocket Edition, four unused 32×32 paintings were present in kz.png that remained unused - using IDA and the Android libminecraftpe.so file, it has been found that the paintings are referenced from the game code, particularly in the Motive::getAllMotivesAsList(void) method (get all paintings), but the Painting::setRandomMotive(int) method excludes them as possibilities for a random painting. In v0.8.0 alpha build 2, despite still being unused, the textures of these paintings were updated to be more detailed.

The paintings are named and designed according to the four classical elements - "Earth" features a brown square on a light brown background, "Water" is split into a lower light blue half and an upper blue half with a jagged line, "Fire" consists of three orange isosceles triangles on a yellow background, with the largest having a small red triangle inside it, and "Wind" features a beige hollow circle on a white background.

According to Helen Zbihlyj[1], these paintings were originally added "as part of a Pocket Edition promo map" (no footage found) which was planned to be a part of Pocket Edition promotion at MINECON 2012 or 2013 and have never been used in game. The artist of these paintings remains unknown.

### Update game blocks

  

This section needs cleanup to comply with the style guide. [discuss]
Please help improve this page. The talk page may contain suggestions.


Main article: info_update


The update game block looks like a dirt block with the word "update!" written with what appears to be grass. This was a placeholder for blocks that were put into the game before the full files made. It was available for the outdated version of 1.13.0 in Bedrock Edition. It could be seen if the player was playing with a friend on 1.13.0 and their device wasn't updated or if using an item in a world then downgrading Minecraft to a version that didn't have the block. Players can still get this by placing an Education Edition block, then disabling Education Edition, also using the /setblock command for a block called "Unknown" places this block, which can then can be broken and collected.
It wasn't called the update game block either, the name used numbers and letters.
It can be found if a friend runs a world on a newer version and all added blocks on that version then have this texture.  
There is also a version of this block with the word "ate!upd".

### Invisible bedrock
Main article: Invisible Bedrock
In Pocket Edition, invisible bedrock made up the borders of old worlds. As of Bedrock Edition 1.18.0, it is no longer possible to create new old worlds, but it is still possible to play existing old worlds that were created prior to this update. The block is now unused, but it can still be obtained via add-ons or inventory editing. If obtained these ways, the texture in inventory is one face of a stone block, and the tooltip is tile.invisiblebedrock.name.
