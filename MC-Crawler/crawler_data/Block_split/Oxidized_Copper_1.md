### Oxidation
Main article: Oxidation
Non-waxed blocks of copper have four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). Lightning bolts and axes can remove the oxidation from blocks of copper. They can be waxed with a honeycomb to prevent the oxidation from progressing.

As the block begins to oxidize (exposed copper), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered copper), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized copper), the block is teal with several green spots.
