## Obtaining
Allow and deny blocks can either be obtained by using the pick block control, or by using various commands, such as /give, or the Creative inventory‌[Minecraft Education  only].

## Usage
When placed, allow blocks let users without world builder status place or destroy blocks in the area above them if immutable world is on, while deny blocks prohibit users without world builder, and their agents, from placing or destroying blocks in the area above them. This area covers an infinite distance above the block but does not cover the area below the block. If two allow or deny blocks are placed on top of one another, the block that is highest takes precedence. The deny block does not prevent the placing of blocks through commands or endermen.

In Bedrock Edition, when placed, allow blocks let users in Adventure status place or destroy blocks in the area above, while deny blocks prohibit Members in Survival and even in Creative from placing or destroying blocks in the area above them.

Both blocks are extremely resistant to explosions, and users with world builder (or permission level 1‌[Bedrock Edition  only]) status are able to place and destroy blocks regardless of where any allow or deny blocks are placed and can also destroy and place the blocks themselves.

Allow blocks do not enable players without building/destroying permissions to build on top of them 

### Piston interactivity
Allow and deny blocks can not be moved by pistons or sticky pistons.
