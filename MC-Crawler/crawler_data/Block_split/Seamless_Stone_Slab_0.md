# Seamless Stone Slab
A seamless stone slab refers to several unused variants of the slab block with metadata exceeding what was actually used at the time. They can be considered a precursor to smooth stone.

## Obtaining
Seamless slabs were never intended to be obtainable by any means, and as such inventory editors are generally the most reliable method of obtaining them.

There exist methods of block transmutation that may be used to obtain seamless stone slabs, allowing them to exist in block form, and then be broken to collect them in item form.

Due to their nature of being extreme data values, and the fact that all of these data values eventually became used in-game, worlds containing the slabs that eventually used said values can be downgraded to obtain seamless slabs in an earlier version. This is, however, risky, and can cause crashes and world corruption.

### Breaking
Seamless stone slabs require a pickaxe to mine, dropping themselves when broken.

## Usage
Seamless stone slabs can be used for any of the things other stone-type slabs can be used for, aside from being a crafting ingredient. They can be placed in the exact same way other slabs can.

### Model
The seamless stone slab can be visually distinguished from normal smooth stone slabs via the texture they use: while smooth stone slabs have a dedicated side texture as to make single slabs appear polished, and double slabs appear to be composed of two single slabs, the seamless stone slab's side texture appears cut off in single form, and in double form identical to smooth stone. Indeed, the seamless stone double slab was itself a precursor to smooth stone, which would end up being implemented intentionally.

The use of a single texture on all sides is a trend that can be seen in many other extreme metadata variants: wood, which also eventually became obtainable intentionally, pistons and sticky pistons, hay bales, and Bedrock Edition-exclusive cases of chiseled quartz blocks, quartz pillars, purpur pillars and bone blocks. (Several other extraneous metadata variants, such as those of lit and unlit furnaces, dispensers, droppers, jack o'lanterns and pumpkins, the last of which also was reimplemented intentionally, used their texture on four sides, due to having a dedicated top and bottom and most being able to face in four directions.)

### Conversion
As the seamless stone slab is, by definition, an extreme metadata value of the smooth stone slab, and metadata was used to distinguish different slab types, seamless stone slabs would end up transforming into these slab variants as a world is updated.
