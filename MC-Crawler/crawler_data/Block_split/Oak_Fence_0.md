## Usage
Main article: Fence § Usage
Wooden fences have the same usages as nether brick fences to form barriers and attaching mobs with a lead.

### Barrier
Fences and Nether brick fences connected by fence gates. Notice that they do not form a connection directly between the two types of fences (in the middle).
Wooden fences connect to other wooden fences, but do not connect to Nether brick fences. However, Nether brick fences connect to wooden fence gates.[1]

### Fuel
Overworld wooden fences can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.

### Note Blocks
Wooden fences can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sound.
